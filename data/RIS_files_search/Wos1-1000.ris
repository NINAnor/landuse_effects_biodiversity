AB  - Alteration of natural disturbances in human-modified landscapes has resulted in many disturbance-dependent species becoming rare. Conservation of such species requires efforts to maintain or recreate disturbance regimes. We compared benefits of confining efforts to habitats in protected areas (a form of land sparing) versus integrating them with general management of production land (a form of land sharing), using two examples: fire in forests and grazing in semi-natural grasslands. We reviewed empirical studies from the temperate northern hemisphere assessing effects of disturbances in protected and non-protected areas, and compiled information from organisations governing and implementing disturbances in Sweden. We found advantages with protection of areas related to temporal continuity and quality of disturbances, but the spatial extent of disturbances is higher on production land. This suggests that an approach where land sparing is complemented with land sharing will be most effective for preservation of disturbance-dependent species in forests and semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Multi-objective management can mitigate conflicts among land-use objectives. However, the effectiveness of a multi-objective solution depends on the spatial scale at which land-use is optimized. This is because the ecological variation within the planning region influences the potential for site-specific prioritization according to the different objectives.
   We optimized the allocation of forest management strategies to maximize the joint production of two conflicting objectives, timber production and carbon storage, at increasing spatial scales. We examined the impacts of the extent of the planning region on the severity of the conflict, the potential for its mitigation, and the strategies that were identified as optimal.
   Using forecasted data from a forest simulator, we constructed Pareto frontiers optimizing the joint provision of the objectives in production forests in Finland. Optimization was conducted within increasing hierarchical spatial scales and outcomes were compared in terms of the severity of the conflict and the solution to mitigate it.
   The trade-offs between timber production and carbon storage appeared less severe and could be mitigated more effectively the larger the planning regions were, but the improvements became minor beyond the scale of 'large forest holding'. The results thus indicate that this scale, approximately 100 stands or 200 ha, is large enough to effectively mitigate the conflict between timber production and carbon storage.
   Management planning over relatively small forest areas (200 ha) can mitigate ecosystem service trade-offs effectively. Thus the effective use of multi-objective optimization tools may be feasible even in small-scale forestry.

AB  - Determining effects of landscape-level conservation strategies is needed, yet a challenging and costly endeavour. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of landscape-level conservation strategies in forests on biodiversity and provision of two ecosystem services (recreation and water quality). Specifically, we focused on the spatial allocation of unmanaged areas in production forests and different levels of "land sharing" or "land sparing". They were represented through seven scenarios constructed for a boreal managed forest landscape in central Sweden. All scenarios had the same total level of conservation effort, but they differed in the combinations of sizes of unmanaged areas and how these areas were spread in the landscape. In one scenario, this was complemented with extended rotation of production areas. Experts (researchers in relevant fields) assessed these scenarios for overall biodiversity, recreation, and water quality. We used the Delphi technique: experts filled out an online survey individually in two rounds. In the second round they were familiarized with anonymized responses of others from the previous round. There was little agreement between experts whether concentration of unmanaged areas in one part of the landscape or dispersion of them around the entire area is more beneficial, for biodiversity as well as for the two ecosystem services. The explanation of the opinions given by biodiversity experts were based on different ecological theories resulting in different conclusions (mainly habitat complementation vs. metapopulation ecology). A few large unmanaged areas were considered more beneficial for biodiversity than many small areas. The main argument was that long-term species persistence becomes higher with larger areas. For recreation and water quality, there were almost no differences in estimates between these two strategies. One "land sharing" approach, retention trees, received the lowest score. The second "land sharing" approach, extended rotation, was scored higher, especially regarding recreation. This may be because extended rotations generate features of high recreational value, such as mature, thinned forests with not so much dead wood. Conclusively, we suggest a strategy of mixed conservation measures, with considerable efforts directed towards establishing and maintaining large unmanaged areas.

AB  - Yearly, per-area carbon sequestration rates are used to estimate mitigation potentials by comparing types and areas of land management in 1990 and 2000 and projected to 2010, for the European Union (EU)-15 and for four country-level case studies for which data are available: UK, Sweden, Belgium and Finland. Because cropland area is decreasing in these countries (except for Belgium), and in most European countries there are no incentives in place to encourage soil carbon sequestration, carbon sequestration between 1990 and 2000 was small or negative in the EU-15 and all case study countries. Belgium has a slightly higher estimate for carbon sequestration than the other countries examined. This is at odds with previous reports of decreasing soil organic carbon stocks in Flanders. For all countries except Belgium, carbon sequestration is predicted to be negligible or negative by 2010, based on extrapolated trends, and is small even in Belgium. The only trend in agriculture that may be enhancing carbon stocks on croplands at present is organic farming, and the magnitude of this effect is highly uncertain.
   Previous studies have focused on the potential for carbon sequestration and have shown quite significant potential. This study, which examines the sequestration likely to occur by 2010, suggests that the potential will not be realized. Without incentives for carbon sequestration in the future, cropland carbon sequestration under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol will not be an option in EU-15.

AB  - Second-home tourism has long traditions in Norway. However, the building and use of holiday homes or cabins is undergoing important changes with consequences for a sustainable development of activities and consumption within this sector. This paper explores how traditional norms about holiday-home or cabin life in Norway are challenged by new standards, activities and ways of organizing family life. By drawing on an analysis of in-depth interviews with 12 families living in central parts of eastern Norway the paper discusses the strong hold of norms and ideals that are associated with the use of holiday homes. However, the traditional Norwegian ideals attached to the primitiveness of cabin life and outdoor recreation is challenged by new norms related to convenience, comfort and extraordinary experiences. Based on the interviews the article explores how these conflicting interests are negotiated and how compromises are reached within the household context.

AB  - There are currently competing demands on Europe's forests and the finite resources and services that they can offer. Forestry intensification that aims at mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation is one example. Whether or not these two objectives compete can be evaluated by comparative studies of forest landscapes with different histories. We test the hypothesis that indicators of wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related in a gradient of long to short forestry intensification histories. Forest management data containing stand age, volume and tree species were used to model the opportunity for wood production and biodiversity conservation in five north European forest regions representing a gradient in landscape history from very long in the West and short in the East. Wood production indicators captured the supply of coniferous wood and total biomass, as well as current accessibility by transport infrastructure. Biodiversity conservation indicators were based on modelling habitat network functionality for focal bird species dependent on different combinations of stand age and tree species composition representing naturally dynamic forests. In each region we randomly sampled 25 individual 100-km(2) areas with contiguous forest cover. Regarding wood production, Sweden's Bergslagen region had the largest areas of coniferous wood, followed by Vitebsk in Belarus and Zemgale in Latvia. NW Russia's case study regions in Pskov and Komi had the lowest values, except for the biomass indicator. The addition of forest accessibility for transportation made the Belarusian and Swedish study region most suitable for wood and biomass production, followed by Latvia and two study regions in NW Russian. Regarding biodiversity conservation, the overall rank among regions was opposite. Mixed and deciduous habitats were functional in Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Old Scots pine and Norway spruce habitats were only functional in Komi. Thus, different regional forest histories provide different challenges in terms of satisfying both wood production and biodiversity conservation objectives in a forest management unit. These regional differences in northern Europe create opportunities for exchanging experiences among different regional contexts about how to achieve both objectives. We discuss this in the context of land-sharing versus land-sparing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The first International Conference on Urban Tree Diversity hosted in June 2014 by the Swedish University of Agricultural Science in Alnarp, Sweden highlighted the need for a better understanding of the current state of urban tree diversity. Here we present and discuss a selection of urban tree diversity themes with the intention of developing and sharing knowledge in a research area that is gaining momentum. We begin by discussing the specific role of species diversity in ecosystem service provision and ecosystem stability. This is followed by exploring the urban conditions that affect species richness. Having determined that many ecosystem services depend on urban tree species diversity and that urban environments are capable of supporting high species diversity, we conclude by addressing how to govern for urban tree diversity.

AB  - Both species and genetic diversity of plant communities can affect insect herbivores, but a few studies have compared the effects of both diversity levels within the same experimental context. We compared the effects of tree species and genetic diversity on abundance, species richness, and -diversity of leaf-miner communities associated with silver birch using two long-term forest diversity experiments in Finland where birch trees were planted in monocultures and mixtures of birch genotypes or other trees species. Although both abundance and species richness of leaf miners differed among birch genotypes at the tree level, birch genetic diversity had no significant effect on miner abundance and species richness at the plot level. Instead, birch genetic diversity affected leaf-miner -diversity with species turnover being higher among trees within genotypic mixtures than among trees within monoclonal plots. In contrast, tree species diversity had a significant negative effect on both leaf-miner abundance and species richness at plot level, but no effect on miner -diversity. Significant tree species diversity effects on leaf-miner abundance and species richness were found only in plots with high tree density. We have demonstrated that plant species and genetic diversity play important but contrasting roles in structuring associated herbivore communities. Tree species diversity largely affects miner abundance and species richness, whereas tree genetic diversity affects miner -diversity. These results have important implications for conservation and management of woodlands.

AB  - Context Theory predicts that species diversity of isolated habitat patches depends on patch size and isolation. However, there are few previous studies of how patch size and isolation influence community composition. This study tested theory using small and isolated farmland patches in a forested matrix. Objectives I tested whether bird species diversity and community composition of isolated farmland patches depended on patch size, measures of isolation (e.g. distance from the main farmland areas; up to 15 km), and other variables such as presence of human habitation. Methods Farmland bird species diversity and community composition (relative proportions of different ecological guilds) of 130 farmland patches within forest landscapes were recorded in Norway. Results Species diversity and proportion of the species that nested on the ground or low in bushes increased with patch size. Distance from the main farmland region was not related to species diversity or community composition, but species diversity increased when there were stepping stones present. Sites inhabited by humans had higher species diversity, a larger proportion of species nesting high in trees or in cavities (such as in buildings), and a larger proportion of resident species. Other variables were less important. There was also a strong relationship between the occupancy of individual species in the main farmland region and their occupancy in the forest region, suggesting that colonisation pressure also influenced species diversity of these habitat islands. Conclusions I found weak evidence of isolation effects on bird species diversity and community composition of farmland patches within forest, whereas most of the variation was explained by patch size and presence of humans.

AB  - Intensive agriculture is often bad for wildlife. Does this imply that a goal to boost wildlife on agricultural land is best met through a general reduction in intensity? We argue that such an approach may not be optimal, since cost functions for provision of wildlife on agricultural land may be non-convex, due to fixed costs associated with such provision. This implies that, even when farms are identical, it may be preferable to split them into groups of high providers and low providers. We test our hypothesis in a study of the optimal management of mown grasslands in southern Sweden, where the two products are silage and successful reproduction of ground-nesting birds, and the variable controlled by the farmer is the date of the first mowing. We show that the optimal solution is likely to involve some farmers maintaining profit-maximizing practices while other-identical-farmers delay their first mowing significantly. The superiority of such split solutions may have major implications for agricultural policy.

AB  - The relative merits of land sparing versus land sharing are being debated within conservation biology. While the debate is multifaceted, a central issue concerns the ability of biodiversity to actually persist in shared' human-dominated landscapes. There is a widespread perception that large predators are synonymous with wilderness and have a low tolerance for human-modified landscapes. However, there is an increasing body of evidence that is questioning this paradigm. In order to explore the tolerance levels of Eurasian lynx to human activity, we have analysed data on 49 lynx home ranges in south-eastern Norway occupying a gradient of landscapes from near wilderness to the urban-forest interface. Our results indicate that lynx have the ability to tolerate relatively high levels of human presence both within their home ranges and within the immediate surroundings of their home ranges. Home-range orientations reflect preference for areas associated with low levels of human-induced habitat modification, and avoidance of the more heavily disturbed areas. The results show that lynx have a large potential to exist in shared landscapes if their presence is tolerated by people.

AB  - Human well-being highly depends on ecosystem services and this dependence is expected to increase in the future with increasing population and economic growth. Studies that investigate trade-offs between ecosystem services are urgently needed for informing policy-makers. We examine the trade-offs between a provisioning (revenues from timber selling) and regulating (carbon storage and sequestration) ecosystem services among seven alternative forest management regimes in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimate the potential of the landscape to produce harvest revenues and store/sequester carbon across a 50-year time period. Then, we identify conflicts between harvest revenues and carbon storage and sequestration. Finally, we apply multiobjective optimization to find optimal combinations of forest management regimes that maximize harvest revenues and carbon storage/sequestration. Our results show that no management regime alone is able to either maximize harvest revenues or carbon services and that a combination of different regimes is needed. We also show that with a relatively little economic investment (5% decrease in harvest revenues), a substantial increase in carbon services could be attained (9% for carbon storage; 15-23% for carbon sequestration). We conclude that it is possible to achieve win-win situations applying diversified forest management planning at a landscape level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - In southeastern Norway 1998-2000, the number of specimens, species richness and species diversity (measured by Simpsons diversity index) of Agromyzidae were investigated in biologically and conventionally grown spring barley and grass fields. Flies were caught by sweepnet in 1 x 10 m plots in the boundary, 0.5, 5, 15 and 30 m into the fields. A total of 5822 specimens of at least 66 species were caught during the 3 years. The pest species Chromatomyia fuscula (Zett.) and Cerodontha denticornis (Panzer) were most numerous in the fields, while most other species were most numerous in the boundaries. The species richness (for grass only) and species diversity (for cereals and grass) were significantly higher in biological fields, although the pest species (Ce. denticornis and Ch. fuscula) were less abundant in the biologically treated fields. In spring barley fields the species richness and species diversity were significantly reduced when moving from the boundary and into the field. In grass fields this was shown for species richness, but not for species diversity.

AB  - This study deals with describing the carbon sequestration potential and the economic prerequisites when using waste water as fertilizer. There is a large potential to sequester carbon and at the same time purify waste water in Norway spruce. It is concluded that the costs for sequestering carbon through application with waste water can be lower than when using commercial fertilizers.

AB  - Alternative cropping practices can be expected to increase the diversity and change the species composition of weed communities. In a six-year field experiment we compared species diversity and species composition in the weed community of cereal fields cultivated by conventional and by low-input cropping methods. In the conventional cropping both mineral fertilizers and herbicides were applied but in the low-input cropping the fertlizer was manure and herbicides were avoided altogether. The level of nitrogen fertilization was higher in conventional cropping. A five-year crop rotation comprising rye, oat-pea, barley and two-year grasslands was used in both cropping methods. We found that the species pool was larger (42 vs 35 species) and the average number of species higher (20.2 vs 13.1 species) in low-input than in conventional cropping. This was the case both in the data pooled across crops and in each crop separately. Herbicides affected species diversity and species composition more than did nitrogen fertilization. Species susceptible to the herbicides applied declined in abundance, which resulted in more skewed dominance patterns in the communities of conventional fields than in those of low-input fields. The crop affected the species composition of weed communities more than did the cropping method. Our results suggest that weed species diversity could be promoted by using low-intensity cropping practices.

AB  - The diversity of native species is assumed to limit invasion by alien species, but there is a negative relationship between native and alien species diversity at fine spatial scales and a positive one at broad scales. This contradiction has been termed the invasion paradox, and it ensues from various processes operating at different spatial scales, such as species interactions and environmental heterogeneity. We investigated the relationship between native and alien plant species diversity components (alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity) and their response to environmental factors at three spatial scales (1, 50 m(2), 0.25 km(2)) in semi-natural agricultural habitats in Finland. Native and alien species diversity components were positively correlated across spatial scales, and the beta diversity contributed most to the total observed alien and native species richness (gamma-diversity). The diversities of native and alien species were positively associated with productivity at the 1 m(2) scale. At broader scales, alien and native species diversity responded similarly to geographical location, but differently to the productivity, disturbance and landscape diversity. Alien species diversity was positively correlated with disturbance regime, whereas native species were more strongly related to habitat type, and decreasing land-use intensity. Native and alien diversities were affected by both average and variability in local habitat conditions. Thus, both favourable conditions and heterogeneity in environmental conditions may contribute to the diversity-invasibility relationships. Disturbance regime typical of agricultural habitats may create open niches for both native and alien species, limit species competition even at fine spatial scales and lead to a positive diversity-invasibility relationship.

AB  - 1. The influence of tree species diversity and functional group on soil properties (carbon stock, pH and C/N ratio) has not been explored across major European forest types.
   2. We evaluated the relative importance of tree species diversity and functional group for soil carbon (C) stocks, C/N ratio and pH in major European forest types in the six regions Finland, Poland, Germany, Romania, Italy and Spain. We sampled soils in 209 permanent plots along a species diversity gradient from monocultures to five-species mixtures.
   3. Carbon stocks in the topsoil (forest floor (FF), 0-10cm and FF+0-10cm) were positively, but weakly, related to diversity across the regions. While the C/N ratio in the FF+0-10cm layer decreased significantly with increasing diversity in the Spanish region, pH was unrelated to species diversity across the regions. Tree species functional group (in terms of conifer proportion, CP) explained a larger proportion of the variability in soil properties than diversity. Conifer admixture increased C stock and C/N ratio, and decreased pH, but the impacts differed between the regions in some layers. Differences in mean annual temperature, actual evapotranspiration and soil texture between the regions were possible driving factors behind the different CP effects in Finland, Spain and Germany.
   4. The results imply that targeted selection of tree species with desired characteristics, e.g. complementary traits for resource use, is a preferred management approach for influencing soil C stock, C/N ratio and pH in mixed forests rather than increasing tree species diversity per se.

AB  - Several studies have shown the economic value of various ecosystem services provided by the forest. However, the economic value of how site-specific ecological conditions interact with other functions provided by the forest, such as timber value and carbon sequestration, has been less studied. As a result, this paper constructs a numerical discrete dynamic optimization model to estimate the economic value of site quality, taking into account its interaction with timber value and carbon sequestration, in Swedish forests. Analytical results show that the inclusion of the interaction of site quality with forest growth affects the optimal volume of harvest per year, compared to the case without consideration of site quality. The empirical results show that net present value, when considering timber values plus carbon sequestration and site quality interaction, is higher than the case where only timber and carbon sequestration were considered. However, the calculated net present value is sensitive to, in particular, the price of carbon sequestration and discount rate.

AB  - Species diversity includes two aspects, the number of species (species richness) and the proportional abundances of the species (heterogeneity diversity). Species richness and heterogeneity diversity can be measured over different scales; a single point, samples, large scales, biogeographical provinces and in assemblages and habitats. In the literature, the terminology of these scales is confused. Here, scales are given a uniform notation. Scales of species richness and heterogeneity diversity are distinguished from turnover (beta) diversity, which is the degree of change in species composition along a gradient. Methods of measurement of the scales of species richness, heterogeneity diversity, turnover diversity and for estimating total species richness are reviewed. Two methods for measuring heterogeneity diversity are recommended Exp H' (where H' is the Shannon-Wiener index) and 1/Simpson's index, together with an equitability index J'. The reviewed methods are then applied to a data set from the Norwegian continental shelf to illustrate the advantages of the recommended methods. Finally, the application of the methods to assessment of effects of disturbance, to studies of gradients of species richness and to conservation issues are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We extend the study of economically optimal carbon storage to a previously unexplored forest type, mixed-species size-structured stands. The ecological model applied in the study is a transition matrix model with growth functions for boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.), and other broadleaves. The other broadleaved trees are assumed to have no commercial value. We maximize the sum of timber revenues and the value of carbon storage by optimizing the timing and intensity of thinnings and the potentially infinite rotation age. The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form using gradient-based interior point methods and a genetic algorithm. We present results for a mixed stand of Norway spruce and birch, and a mixed stand of Norway spruce, birch, and other broadleaves, and compare these to a pure Norway spruce stand. We show that carbon pricing increases stand volume by postponing harvests and limiting them to larger trees, and changes the optimal species composition by increasing the share of Norway spruce relative to birch. Further, carbon pricing incentivizes maintaining other broadleaves in the stand despite their lack of commercial value, thus increasing tree species diversity. We find that sawlog and total yields increase with carbon price. We show that the higher the number of tree species in a stand, the lower the marginal cost of carbon storage.

AB  - Transformation of landscapes is considered to be one of the main drivers behind species loss, regionally and globally. Theory and empirical studies suggest that landscape structure influences species diversity in many habitats. These effects may be manifested at different spatial scales depending on species response to landscape heterogeneity. A similar, but often neglected, scaling issue concerns the temporal scale of species response to landscape change. In this study, we found time lags of 50-100 years in the response of plant species diversity to changing configuration of habitats in the landscape. When analyzing remnants of traditionally managed seminatural grasslands in Sweden, we found that species diversity was not related to present-day connectivity of the investigated sites, irrespective of spatial scale (3.1-12.5 km(2)). However, when using maps depicting landscapes 50 and 100 years ago, respectively, strong positive effects of habitat connectivity appeared, at increasing spatial scale for the older landscapes. Thus, analyses of how species diversity relates to present-day landscapes may be misleading, and future species loss may be expected even if the present landscape is maintained.

AB  - Single species forest systems often suffer from low resistance and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree species diversity is discussed as an important management approach to address the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of tree species mixtures remains unknown.
   We asked whether increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a multi-model simulation experiment under climate change, applying two forest landscape models (iLand and LandClim) across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability of biomass stocks and forest structure.
   In general, increasing levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive diversity effects increased with increasing severity of climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable effects on temporal stability.
   Diversity effects were context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps. The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the robustness of our findings.
   Synthesis and application. Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial scales.

AB  - Boreal forests are an important source of timber and pulp wood, but provide also other products and services. Utilizing a simulation program and field data from a tree retention experiment in a Scots pine forest in central Sweden, we simulated the consequences during the following 100 years of various levels of retention on production of merchantable wood, dead wood input (as a proxy for biodiversity), and carbon stock changes. At the stand level, wood production decreased with increased retention levels, while dead wood input and carbon stock increased. We also compared 12 scenarios representing a land sharing/land sparing gradient. In each scenario, a constant volume of wood was harvested with a specific level of retention in a 100-ha landscape. The area not needed to reach the defined volume was set-aside during a 100-year rotation period, leading to decreasing area of set-asides with increasing level of retention across the 12 scenarios. Dead wood input was positively affected by the level of tree retention whereas the average carbon stock decreased slightly with increasing level of tree retention. The scenarios will probably vary in how they favor species preferring different substrates. Therefore, we conclude that a larger variation of landscape-level conservation strategies, also including active creation of dead wood, may be an attractive complement to the existing management.

AB  - Non-ferrous smelters pose a potential hazard for breeding bird populations, but comprehensive analyses of the impacts on bird population densities around smelter sites are currently lacking. We measured with point counts bird population densities around four smelter sites in Russia (Monchegorsk, Karabash and Revda) and Finland (Harjavalta) to explore the relationships between bird population density/species diversity and exposure level quantified by the potentially bioavailable copper concentrations in forest litter. Total bird densities, bird biomasses and species diversities decreased in the vicinity of all three Russian smelters. In Harjavalta, there were no pollution-related trends in total bird density or biomass, although species diversity (species number and Shannon's index) decreased towards the pollution source. In general, the four smelters showed negative effects on bird populations in decreasing order of impact as follows: Monchegorsk > Karabash > Revda > Harjavalta, reflecting the amount of current and past emissions and consequent habitat change at each site. Our results suggest that around copper-nickel and copper smelters the pollution impact on bird diversity is accelerated when the litter copper level exceeds 1000 mu g/g. However, even though bird densities and diversities reflected the exposure levels in our study, they were not associated with litter copper concentrations in a strictly dose-dependent manner, indicating that copper itself is not a primary cause for the changes in bird communities, but rather the combined effect of multiple pollutants on birds and especially on the resources necessary for breeding, such as food and suitable habitat.

AB  - To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that govern biological diversity in various environments is one of the greatest challenges for the scientific community of today. Compared to terrestrial and benthic habitats, mechanisms regulating species diversity in planktonic ecosystems have been dealt with relatively little. This is mainly due to the scarcity of the experimental evidence from field studies where the multitude of spatiotemporal scales have been covered with sufficient resolution. This paper discusses the pecularities of the aquatic system as a growth environment for phytoplankton in comparison to terrestrial/connected systems. Examples of the regulation of species diversity in the Baltic Sea are presented.

AB  - 1. Temperate semi-natural grasslands are characterized by high levels of species diversity and have a high conservation value. Plant species diversity in grazed semi-natural grasslands is known to be influenced by management intensity and habitat connectivity. Both grazing pressure and between-patch connectivity are expected to depend on the movement patterns of livestock in the landscape.
   2. The present study examines associations between fine-scale (within 0.25 m(2) plots) plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands and present grazing intensity, present and historical habitat connectivity, and the (present and historical) distance from the nearest village. The study area was a local (4.5 x 4.5 km) agricultural landscape on the island of Oland, Sweden.
   3. Fine-scale (Shannon) diversity and species richness were unimodally associated with the distance from the nearest historical (ad 1800) village, with maximum values c. 1-1.5 km from villages. These associations suggest that the distance from historical villages behaves as an integrated descriptor of variation in long-termmanagement intensity (livestock movements) and reflects aspects of the functional connectivity between plant communities in semi-natural grasslands.
   4. Groups of variables characterizing village distances, grazing pressure and habitat connectivity had overlapping effects on species diversity. Grazing intensity had the largest individual impact on diversity, followed by the distance from the nearest historical village and present-day habitat connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The study indicates the importance of viewing grassland diversity in the context of local landscape history. Unimodal associations between fine-scale plant species diversity and the distance from the nearest village in ad 1800 suggest that information on the proximity to villages in the historical landscape has a potential use in conservation planning - as an indicator of variation in long-term grassland management intensity. Conservation programmes for grazed temperate grasslands should (1) give priority to old grasslands with an uninterrupted history of grazing management, (2) ensure a moderate grazing intensity, (3) avoid overgrazing and/or long breaks in the continuity of grazing management.

AB  - The study explores whether small-scale species diversity, species evenness and species richness in semi-natural grassland communities are similarly associated with present management regime and/or present and historical landscape context (percentage of different land-cover types in the surroundings). Species diversity, evenness and richness were recorded within 44150 x 50 cm grassland plots in a 4.5 x 4.5 km agricultural landscape on bland, Sweden. Recent and historical land-cover maps (years 2004, 1959, 1938, 1835, and 1800) were used to characterize the present and past landscape context of the sampled vegetation plots. Partial regression and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to explore the relationships between species diversity measures (Shannon diversity, richness and evenness) and different explanatory variables while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the data. The results indicated that species richness was relatively sensitive to grassland isolation, while the response of species evenness to isolation was characterized by a degree of inertia. Because the richness and evenness components of species diversity may respond differently to habitat fragmentation, we suggest that monitoring projects and empirical studies that focus on changes in biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands should include the assessment of species evenness - as a complement to the assessment of species richness. In addition, our results indicated that the development and persistence of a species-rich and even grassland vegetation was favoured in areas that have historically (in the 19th century) been surrounded by grasslands. Information on landscape history should, whenever possible, be incorporated into the planning of strategies for grassland conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Norway spruce dominates mountain forests in Europe. Natural variations in the mountainous coniferous forests are strongly influenced by all the main components of forest and landscape dynamics: species diversity, the structure of forest stands, nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and other ecosystem services. This paper deals with an empirical windthrow risk model based on the integration of logistic regression into GIS to assess forest vulnerability to wind-disturbance in the mountain spruce forests of Sumava National Park (Czech Republic). It is an area where forest management has been the focus of international discussions by conservationists, forest managers, and stakeholders. The authors developed the empirical windthrow risk model, which involves designing an optimized data structure containing dependent and independent variables entering logistic regression. The results from the model, visualized in the form of map outputs, outline the probability of risk to forest stands from wind in the examined territory of the national park. Such an application of the empirical windthrow risk model could be used as a decision support tool for the mountain spruce forests in a study area. Future development of these models could be useful for other protected European mountain forests dominated by Norway spruce.

AB  - Recent studies assessing agricultural policies, including the EU's Agri-Environment Scheme, have shown that these have been successful in attaining some environmental goals. In Finland, however, the economic situation of farms has dramatically fallen and hence, the actions do not result in social acceptability. Sustainable intensification is a means to combine the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. Here we introduce a novel land use optimization and planning tool for the sustainable intensification of high-latitude agricultural systems. The main rationale for the development of the tool was to achieve a systematic and comprehensive conception for land allocation across Finland, where field parcels vary substantially in their conditions. The developed tool has a three-step scoring system based on seven physical characteristics (parcel size, shape, slope, distance to the farm center and waterways, soil type and logistic advantages) and the productivity of field parcels. The productivity estimates are based on vegetation indices derived from optical satellite data. The tool allocates virtually all > 1 million field parcels in Finland either to sustainable intensification, extensification or afforestation. The tool is dynamic in the sense that its boundary values for land allocation can be fixed according to changes in social targets and supporting policies. Additionally, it can be applied year after year by acknowledging new available data, e.g., on vegetation indices and field parcel re-arrangements between farms. Furthermore, it can be applied to all farm types and across Finland. It is a tool for land use planning, implementation and monitoring, but its thorough implementation calls for further development of policy instruments, which are currently more supportive towards land sharing than land sparing activities.

AB  - Land-use policies aim at enhancing the sustainable use of natural resources. The Triad approach has been sug-gested to balance the social, ecological, and economic demands of forested landscapes. The core idea is to enhance multifunctionality at the landscape level by allocating landscape zones with specific management pri-orities, i.e., production (intensive management), multiple use (extensive management), and conservation (forest reserves). We tested the efficiency of the Triad approach and identified the respective proportion of above-mentioned zones needed to enhance multifunctionality in Finnish forest landscapes. Through a simulation and optimization framework, we explored a range of scenarios of the three zones and evaluated how changing their relative proportion (each ranging from 0 to 100%) impacted landscape multifunctionality, measured by various biodiversity and ecosystem service indicators. The results show that maximizing multifunctionality required around 20% forest area managed intensively, 50% extensively, and 30% allocated to forest reserves. In our case studies, such landscape zoning represented a good compromise between the studied multifunctionality compo-nents and maintained 61% of the maximum achievable net present value (i.e., total timber economic value). Allocating specific proportion of the landscape to a management zone had distinctive effects on the optimized economic or multifunctionality values. Net present value was only moderately impacted by shifting from intensive to extensive management, while multifunctionality benefited from less intensive and more diverse management regimes. This is the first study to apply Triad in a European boreal forest landscape, highlighting the usefulness of this approach. Our results show the potential of the Triad approach in promoting forest multi-functionality, as well as a strong trade-off between net present value and multifunctionality. We conclude that simply applying the Triad approach does not implicitly contribute to an overall increase in forest multi-functionality, as careful forest management planning still requires clear landscape objectives.

AB  - Biodiversity (species richness and species diversity) of chydorid Cladocera were examined by weekly sweep net sampling during the ice-free period and through surface sediment assemblages in 9 limnologically different lakes in southern Finland. Species richness in the sweep net samples was low in 2 lakes with recent ecological perturbations and the highest in one oligotrophic lake. Species diversity was the lowest in 2 eutrophicated lakes and generally higher in the oligotrophic lakes. The biodiversity values in sediment assemblages showed trends similar to those in the sweep net samples; the lowest values were observed in one of the eutrophic lakes and the highest in the oligotrophic lakes. It is likely that the observed differences were due to the impact of nutrients on the development of littoral vegetation and consequently chydorid habitats and resources. The role of nutrients as a forcing mechanism on chydorid biodiversity was indicated by high and significant negative correlations between species diversity in both total phosphorus and sweep net and sediment samples. The comparison between biodiversity in the 2 sample types showed that the biodiversity values were almost consistently higher in the surface sediment assemblages than in the sweep net samples, suggesting that surface sediment analysis provides an effective alternative method to living material examination for biodiversity evaluations.

AB  - Forest management affects the quantity of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration in standing biomass, carbon storage in forest products and production of bioenergy. The main question studied in this paper is whether forest carbon sequestration is worth increasing at the expense of bioenergy and forest products to achieve the EU emissions reduction target for 2050 in a cost-efficient manner. A dynamic cost minimisation model is used to find the optimal combination of carbon abatement strategies to meet annual emissions targets between 2010 and 2050. The results indicate that forest carbon sequestration is a low-cost abatement method. With sequestration, the net present costs of meeting EU carbon targets can be reduced by 23%.

AB  - Forests make up large ecosystems and by the uptake of carbon dioxide can play an important role in mitigating the greenhouse effect. In this study, mitigation of carbon emissions through carbon uptake and storage in forest biomass and the use of forest biofuel for fossil fuel substitution were considered. The analysis was performed for a 3.2 million hectare region in northern Sweden. The objective was to maximize net present value for harvested timber, biofuel production and carbon sequestration. A carbon price for build-up of carbon storage and for emissions from harvested forest products was introduced to achieve an economic value for carbon sequestration. Forest development was simulated using an optimizing stand-level planning model, and the solution for the whole region was found using linear programming. A range of carbon prices was used to study the effect on harvest levels and carbon sequestration. At a zero carbon price, the mean annual harvest level was 5.4 million m(3), the mean annual carbon sequestration in forest biomass was 1.48 million tonnes and the mean annual replacement of carbon from fossil fuel with forest biofuel was 61000 tonnes. Increasing the carbon price led to decreasing harvest levels of timber and decreasing harvest levels of forest biofuel. Also, thinning activities decreased more than clear-cut activities when the carbon prices increased. The level of carbon sequestration was governed by the harvest level and the site productivity. This led to varying results for different parts of the region.

AB  - In intensive agricultural environments, arable field margins are important habitats as reservoirs of various beneficial wild species. Many studies of species diversity in field margins have focused on the local habitat level. However, relationships between the network of the margin habitats and species diversity are less studied.
   Edge density index of field patches is a class-level landscape metric used as one measure of habitat network. This study focused on edge density index and its impacts on plant species richness and community turnover among the margins in agricultural landscapes. We examined how effectively the index of edge density can be used as a class-level indicator for species diversity in margins. This study introduces a method for indicating plant species diversity of the margin habitats by using an easily measured spatial indicator without comprehensive analysis of land use/land cover.
   A total of 29 landscape-square pairs, each consisting of two 25 ha squares, were sampled across southern Finland. Vascular plant species were sampled in each square. In GIS, field patch edges were divided into two types: those within crop fields, referred to as within-field edges, and those between crop fields and non-crop lands, referred to as non-crop field edges.
   By comparing the roles of three landscape groups (the two different edge types as well as all edges grouped together) in explaining plant species richness (at alpha and gamma level) and community turnover (at beta level) in the sampled landscape squares, we found that density index of non-crop field edges surrounded by contrast land use is an effective indicator of species diversity at beta and gamma level. This study suggested that field margins surrounded by contrast land use shall be considered as a priority landscape element in agricultural edge network design, whereas simply using the density of all field edges to indicate species diversity without separating the different effects of various edge types shall not be recommended.

AB  - Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by reduction of fuel and food consumption and by implementation of negative emissions (such as forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage) has been suggested in both scientific literature and practice, but there exist no calculations of the cost efficient combination of these measures. One challenge for calculations is the uncertainty in reductions of GHG, in particular for negative emissions, depending on e.g. stochastic weather conditions. This paper develops a static model with probabilistic emission constraints to calculate cost efficient emission reductions in the transportation (gasoline and diesel) and food (meat and dairy products) sectors combined with negative emission (carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage technologies) creation in Sweden under uncertainty. The results show that emission reductions in fuel and food consumption are relatively expensive, and that carbon sequestration are relatively low cost measures. We also show that the regional effects at the county level are regressive, that is, that relatively poor counties will carry large cost burdens in the cost efficient solutions and that this effect is increased when negative emissions are included but decreased when uncertainty is considered.

AB  - Based on the simulation of a spatially explicit individual-based model, this study examined the long-term impacts of understory thinning on stand structure, tree growth and number of tree species in a subtropical forest on the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. The treatment options for understory thinning were defined by combinations of thinning cycle and critical size of thinning trees. The results of the simulation demonstrated that understory thinning had no major influence on the growth of canopy trees, and conversely reduced the stand biomass over time. Moreover, tree species diversity drastically decreased with thinning of understory trees. Frequent thinning of smaller trees prevented the regeneration of understory species. Our predictions suggested that the prescription of understory thinning has a negative impact on the economic efficiency of timber production and the resilience of tree species diversity in a subtropical forest in southern Japan. This is contrary to the expectation that understory thinning, regarded as being analogous to the traditional prescription for coppice woodland, fosters a productive forest with species diversity.

AB  - We optimize timber and bioenergy production combined with carbon storage in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands, using an ecological-economic model. Forest growth is specified with a highly detailed process-based growth specification, and optimization is based on an efficient generalized pattern search algorithm. The optimized variables are rotation length, initial stand density, and the number, intensity, timing, and type of thinnings. The carbon pool includes all aboveground biomass (including dead trees) and timber products. The analysis includes the comparison of different carbon subsidy systems. The results are presented for the most relevant site types and thermal zones in Finland. Carbon storage increases the optimal rotation length, number of thinnings, and initial density at all forest sites. Carbon storage effects on stand density and harvests are strongest at poor sites. Timber output increases with carbon price. High natural mortality in our results implies notable carbon storage in dead trees and a positive contribution to biodiversity. The stand-level analysis is extended to a cost-efficient national-level carbon storage plan.

AB  - Forest structural change affects the forest's growth and the carbon storage. Two treatments, thinning (30% thinning intensity) and underplanting plus thinning, are being implemented in a coastal Metasequoia glyptostroboides forest shelterbelt in Eastern China. The vegetation carbon storage significantly increased in the underplanted and thinned treatments compared with that in the unthinned treatment (P < 0.05). The soil and litterfall carbon storage in the underplanted treatment were significantly higher than those in the unthinned treatment (P < 0.05). The total forest ecosystem carbon storage in the underplanted and thinned treatments increased by 35.3% and 26.3%, respectively, compared with that in the unthinned treatment, an increase that mainly came from the growth of vegetation aboveground. Total ecosystem carbon storage showed no significant difference between the underplanted and thinned treatments (P > 0.05). The soil light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) was significantly higher at the 0-15 cm soil layer in the thinned and underplanted stands compared with that in the unthinned stand (P < 0.05). The soil respiration of the underplanted treatment was significantly higher than that of the unthinned treatment only in July (P < 0.05). This study concludes that 30% thinning and underplanting after thinning could be more favorable to carbon sequestration for M. glyptostroboides plantations in the coastal areas of Eastern China.

AB  - The policy term green infrastructure highlights the need to maintain functional ecosystems as a foundation for sustainable societies. Because forests are the main natural ecosystems in Europe, it is crucial to understand the extent to which forest landscape management delivers functional green infrastructures. We used the steep west-east gradient in forest landscape history, land ownership, and political culture within northern Europe's Baltic Sea Region to assess regional profiles of benefits delivered by forest landscapes. The aim was to support policy-makers and planners with evidence-based knowledge about the current conditions for effective wood production and biodiversity conservation. We developed and modeled four regional-level indicators for sustained yield wood production and four for biodiversity conservation using public spatial data. The western case study regions in Sweden and Latvia had high forest management intensity with balanced forest losses and gains which was spatially correlated, thus indicating an even stand age class distribution at the local scale and therefore long-term sustained yields. In contrast, the eastern case study regions in Belarus and Russia showed spatial segregation of areas with forest losses and gains. Regarding biodiversity conservation indicators, the west-east gradient was reversed. In the Russian, Belarusian, and Latvian case study regions, tree species composition was more natural than in Sweden, and the size of contiguous areas without forest loss was larger. In all four case study regions, 54-85% of the total land base consisted of forest cover, which is above critical fragmentation thresholds for forest landscape fragmentation. The results show that green infrastructures for wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related among the four case study regions, and thus rival. While restoration for biodiversity conservation is needed in the west, intensified use of wood and biomass is possible in the east. However, a cautious approach should be applied because intensification of wood production threatens biodiversity. We discuss the barriers and bridges for spatial planning in countries with different types of land ownership and political cultures and stress the need for a landscape approach based on evidence-based collaborative learning processes that include both different academic disciplines and stakeholders that represent different sectors and levels of governance.

AB  - Forest management in several boreal countries is strongly focused on conifers because they are more productive, the technical quality of their stems is better, and their wood fibers are longer as compared to broadleaves. Favoring conifers in forest management leads to simple forest structures with low resilience and diversity. Such forests are risky in the face of climate change and fluctuating timber prices. Climate change increases the vitality of many forest pests and pathogens such as Heterobasidion spp. and Ips typographus L. which attack mainly spruce. Wind damages are also increasing because of a shorter period of frozen soil to provide a firm anchorage against storms. Wind-thrown trees serve as starting points for bark beetle outbreaks. Increasing the proportion of broadleaved species might alleviate some of these problems. This study predicts the long-term (150 years) consequences of current conifer-oriented forest management in two forest areas, and compared this management with silvicultural strategies that promote mixed forests and broadleaved species. The results show that, in the absence of damages, conifer-oriented forestry would lead to 5-10% higher timber yields and carbon sequestration. The somewhat lower carbon sequestration of broadleaved forests was counteracted by their higher albedo (reflectance). Mixed and broadleaf forests were better providers of recreational amenities. Species diversity was much higher in mixed stand and broadleaf-oriented silviculture at stand and forest levels. The analysis indicates that conifer-oriented forest management produces rather small and uncertain economic benefits at a high cost in resilience and diversity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the potential impacts of climate change on the spatial patterns of primary production and net carbon sequestration in relation to water availability in Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated forests throughout Finland (N 60A degrees-N 70A degrees). The Finnish climatic scenarios (FINADAPT) based on the A2 emission scenario were used. According to the results, the changing climate increases the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in southern Finland, while it slightly decreases the ratio in northern Finland, with regionally lower and higher soil water content in the south and north respectively. During the early simulation period of 2000-2030, the primary production and net carbon sequestration are higher under the changing climate in southern Finland, due to a moderate increase in temperature and atmospheric CO2. However, further elevated temperature and soil water stress reduces the primary production and net carbon sequestration from the middle period of 2030-2060 to the final period of 2060-2099, especially in the southernmost region. The opposite occurs in northern Finland, where the changing climate increases the primary production and net carbon sequestration over the 100-year simulation period due to higher water availability. The net carbon sequestration is probably further reduced by the stimulated ecosystem respiration (under climate warming) in southern Finland. The higher carbon loss of the ecosystem respiration probably also offset the increased primary production, resulting in the net carbon sequestration being less sensitive to the changing climate in northern Finland. Our findings suggest that future forest management should carefully consider the region-specific conditions of sites and adaptive practices to climate change for maintained or enhanced forest production and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands with grazing management are characterized by high fine-scale species richness and have a high conservation value. The fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study, we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized as species richness and Simpson's diversity) in dry grazed grasslands. Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m x 4 m) plots on the island of oland (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a 245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20%) but not by the spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant pigment content (400-700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties, such as above-ground biomass (700-1300 nm), were identified as being the most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in surveys of grassland plant diversity.

AB  - Land-use changes and the resulting habitat degradation have been regarded as the most important known causes of waterfowl population declines. We assessed the habitat requirements of waterbirds, including waterfowl, in a hemiboreal, agricultural watershed in southern Finland. We related the birds' species diversity, abundance and brood numbers on ten lakes to environmental variables, including land use characteristics as well as topographic and local biotic features. Both species diversity and pair numbers responded to land use characteristics, such as the area of agricultural land surrounding the lakes. Our results suggest that land use may reflect habitat quality, possibly in terms of resource availability and predation risk. The pair numbers of waterbirds grew along with the availability of invertebrates, an important food resource. The abundance of gulls affected the diversity, abundance and reproductive success of waterfowl positively in our study area, probably because they provided shelter from predators.

AB  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) was introduced in Atlantic Europe in the nineteenth century. Forests of this species are the major forest type in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with substantial areas in Norway, France and Denmark. Most forests are managed under a patch clearfelling regime on comparatively short (35-50 years) rotations. However, forest policies in a number of countries seek to increase the structural and species diversity of Sitka spruce forests: such measures are also proposed to help adapt to projected climate change and management of climate risk. Datasets from 26 experimental plots in Atlantic Europe representing existing and alternative management approaches showed high carbon stocks under current management and lower stocks in all alternatives. In addition, there was little evidence of Sitka spruce being grown successfully in long-term intimate mixture. Thinning is required to increase the diversity of Sitka spruce forests, but this can result in increased risk of wind damage, and hence reduction in carbon stocks, other than on the most sheltered sites. Such risks will be higher with the wetter soils anticipated from greater winter rainfall. Future management of Sitka spruce forests for carbon sequestration should focus both on improvement of current management (e. g. use of higher-yielding genotypes) and on developing wind-stable stands through careful thinning to act as long-term carbon stores.

AB  - Most island-ecology studies focus on the properties of entire island communities, thus neglecting species-environment relationships operating at the habitat-level. Habitat-specific variation in the strength and sign of these relationships will conceal patterns observed on the island scale and may preclude a mechanistic interpretation of patterns and processes. Habitat-specific species-environment relationships may also depend on the descriptor of ecological communities. This paper presents a comprehensive plot-based analysis of local vegetation composition and species diversity (species richness and species evenness) of (i) rocky shore, (ii) semi-natural grassland and (iii) coniferous forest habitats in three Baltic archipelagos in Sweden. To identify differences and consistencies between habitats and descriptors, we assessed the relative contributions of the variable-sets "region", "topography", "soil morphology", "soil fertility", "soil water", "light availability", "distance" and "island configuration" on local vegetation composition, species richness and species evenness. We quantified the impact of "management history" on the descriptors of local grassland communities by a newly introduced grazing history index (GHI). Unlike species diversity, changes in vegetation composition were related to most of the variable-sets. The relative contributions of the variable-sets were mostly habitat-specific and strongly contingent on the descriptor involved. Within each habitat, richness and evenness were only partly affected by the same variable-sets, and if so, their relative contribution varied between diversity proxies. Across all habitats, soil variable-sets showed highly consistent effects on vegetation composition and species diversity and contributed most to the variance explained. GHI was a powerful predictor, explaining high proportions of variation in all three descriptors of grassland species communities. The proportion of unexplained variance was habitat-specific, possibly reflecting a community maturity gradient. Our results reveal that species richness alone is an incomplete representation of local species diversity. Finally, we stress the need of including habitat-based approaches when analyzing complex species-environment relationships on islands.

AB  - This study presents a combined simulation-optimization approach for the multipurpose conversion of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) forests in the Black Forest area of Germany. Conversion strategies were modeled as a means of adapting existing spruce forests to an expected climate change by admixing beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), a native species in large areas of the low mountain ranges of Central Europe. The evolution of the forest state over time was simulated by adopting a single-tree growth tool, TreeGrOSS, and using national forest inventory data. The stochastic genetic algorithm was used to solve the optimization problem, incorporating the values of timber, carbon, and species diversity. Analysis of the tradeoffs between objectives was conducted to determine a balanced decision with species enrichment and carbon storage in the growing stock to adapt to future climate changes. An average overall net present value of 12,158(sic)/ha was obtained for satisfying a moderate enhancement in species diversity by establishing beech regeneration in 46% of forest area and storing 39.5 kg/ha carbon in forest biomass. Diversification of silvicultural pathways is needed because of the integration of multiple objectives in the decisionmaking process and dependence on the structural properties of forest stands, e.g., age class.

AB  - Using dataset of 508 transects of 50 m(2), we assessed changes in the invasion level of alien plant species in semi-natural agricultural habitats in three study years (2001, 2005 and 2010) in four geographical regions of Finland. In addition, the impact of environmental factors on the occurrence of the most common neophytes (alien species introduced after the 17th century) and the impact of neophytes on native species diversity were studied. In total, 37 neophyte species were detected, but neophytes regarded as highly invasive were rare and occasional. We detected spatio-temporal variation in the invasion level, but it changed according to the measure used. For instance, alien species diversity was lower in south-western Finland than in other years in 2005, and the relative alien species richness was highest in southern and lowest in eastern Finland. Preferences for environmental conditions (disturbance, habitat type and geographical location) and the impact on plant diversity varied among the most common neophytes. The most common neophytes were positively rather than negatively associated with native and alien species diversity. The results suggest that alien species management and control methods should be species-specific and considered case-by-case. Neophytes do not yet cause severe problems, but regular monitoring is needed to detect changes in their invasion levels.

AB  - Protected areas are one of the main strategic means for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the design of protected areas usually neglects phylogenetic diversity, an important diversity measure. In this paper we assess the phylogenetic diversity and species richness of vascular plants in Fennoscandian protected areas. We evaluate how much species richness and phylogenetic diversity is found within and outside protected areas, and the differences in plant diversity between different categories of protected areas. We also assess the differences in the diversity-area relationship of the different protected area categories in terms of both species richness and phylogenetic diversity. We build a multi-locus phylogeny of 1,519 native vascular plants of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We estimate the phylogenetic diversity and species richness by combining the phylogeny with publicly available occurrence data and the currently protected area system of Fennoscandia. Our results indicate that protected areas in Fennoscandia hold more plant diversity when larger, and that phylogenetic diversity increases faster with area than species richness. We found evidence for more plant diversity outside of protected areas of the different countries of Fennoscandia than inside of protected areas, but no evidence for plant diversity differences between areas with different protection status. Hence, our results indicate that the current protected area system in Fennoscandia is no more effective in conserving phylogenetic diversity and species richness of vascular plants than a random selection of localities. Our results also indicate that planning conservation strategies around phylogenetic diversity, rather than species richness, might be a first step to protect vascular plant diversity more effectively.

AB  - The net gain of carbon in European Union (EU) forest vegetation during 1990-2005 was estimated at 360-400 Tg CO(2) year(-1) by analysing international data. This amount is at low end of the range of recent corresponding estimates, but greater than earlier estimates published for the period 1971-1990. The sequestration took place almost exclusively in areas which were already forested in 1990. In 2005, new plantations, established after 1990, contributed only about 8% to the estimated net gain. The sequestration was estimated to be the greatest in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and Poland regardless of data source and method of estimation. On a per capita basis, the sequestration was estimated to be the greatest in Finland and Latvia. Carbon sequestration in forests is an important component of the long-term carbon balance of the EU. Carbon sequestration in forests is partly driven by a recovery of the ecosystems from human-induced degradation in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Forest management has affected carbon sequestration and merits attention in climate policy presuming that new policies and measures are reconciled with those already in place for the promotion of the diverse goals of land management in Europe.

AB  - This study presents a model that determines the effect of current and future payments for carbon sequestration, proportion of wood that sequesters carbon in long-lived product and land-fills, and amount of carbon in the wood, on the optimal current forest harvest age. Increased current and future prices of carbon would lead to a longer and shorter harvest age, respectively. Higher current prices of carbon could increase the supply of carbon at a decreasing rate due to longer harvest ages. Moderate prices of carbon would encourage landowners to maintain standing timber. Policies focused then on stimulating landowners to hold timber on forestlands may not necessarily imply higher amounts of sequestered carbon. Increased future values of carbon could imply a reduction of the current supply of carbon. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB  - . Onshore wind power is increasingly expanding to meet global and national goals to increase renewable, clean, and fossilfree energy production. In many countries and regions, however, historical and current land use is extensive, and the expansion of wind power has to be well-tuned to avoid risking irreversible legacy losses of existing and traditional land uses, landscape values, and cultures. Hence, assessments of the siting premises of current and forecasted expansion of wind power are strongly needed as a basis for sustainable planning. We present a study from alpine to temperate biomes in Sweden, where an ambitious onshore wind power expansion strategy has been put in place and will result in Swedish landscapes that are typified by wind power. We explored the existing legal framework- i.e., the national interest for wind power according to the Swedish Environmental Code-concerning the spatial interaction with other national interests for nature conservation, landscape values, and other land uses, and the land cover, landowner, and formally protected areas distribution within wind power sites and in their proximity. We found that the national interest framework does not provide sufficient guidance for locating wind power to avoid spatial overlap with conflicting interests and values. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that wind power is located mainly in forest-dominated landscapes, and on lands where private forest companies are the dominant owners but where the proportion of public and non-industrial private ownership increases in the near surroundings. Finally, we found that large areas of formally protected areas are within the proximate areas influenced by wind power. As an extensive onshore wind power expansion is already going on, and an even more extensive expansion is projected, the ways forward toward a sustainable wind power expansion calls for integrated landscape planning approaches that are based on comprehensive assessments of existing interests and values.

AB  - Carbon sequestered through increased forest biomass provides a low cost means to curb emissions and has become a major focus of New Zealand's Emissions Trading Scheme. We present a forest planning optimisation model where land use is governed by forest owners maximising the returns to both timber harvest and carbon sequestration. By varying carbon prices, we model efficient trade-offs between the two forest activities along a modified production possibility frontier for four distinct wood supply regions in New Zealand. Results show that while more productive regions such as the Central North Island (CNI) and Northland have a greater capacity as a carbon sink, it is the less productive regions that have a comparative advantage in carbon sequestration in terms of a lower cost of wood production revenue foregone. However, moderate increases in carbon uptake can be achieved in the CNI at low opportunity cost by subtle changes in forestry management. The implication for policy-makers is that initial increases in carbon sequestration will be achieved at the lowest cost to society by favouring high volume timber production in some productive woodland areas and/or by more carbon farming in less productive areas.

AB  - Nematode communities in a Norway spruce forest in High Tatra National Park, Slovakia were monitored for the period of several years (2006 and 2013). Unfortunately, in May 2014 natural windstorm damaged the forest. This disastrous event, together with preliminary obtained results allowed us to compare the direct impact of windstorm damage of forest habitat on soil nematode assemblages. The forest destruction by windstorm had a significant effect on the total nematode abundance, the abundance of omnivores and herbivores, as well as the nematode species diversity. The most dominant species, representing 55 % of the total nematode fauna, in the plot studied were Acrobeloides nanus followed by Malenchus exiguus, Filenchus vulgaris, Plectus communis, Plectus parvus and Tylencholaimus mirabilis. The abundance of bacterivorous significantly increased after the windstorm, meanwhile the abundance of omnivores, fungivores, and herbivores ectoparasites and epidermal/root hair feeders showed an opposite trend. Of the evaluative indicators, Shannon species diversity (H'spp), maturity index (MI), maturity index 2-5 (MI2-5), sigma maturity index (Sigma MO, enrichment index (El) and structure index (SI) decreased significantly after windstorm. The El and SI indexes characterized soil ecosystems before windstorm (2006 2013) as maturing with low or moderate disturbance, but soil ecosystems shortly after the windstorm (2014) were degraded and nutrient depleted. This also corresponded with graphical display of metabolic footprints characteristics of soil food web. Overall, the nematode communities differed significantly before and after forest damage. These results suggest the role of nematode communities as indicators of environment condition quality or its disruption.

AB  - Does the Norwegian political landscape indicate advocacy of binding international carbon storage commitments in the foreseeable future? Norway's unique geology has understandably prompted a particular interest in the subject. This article analyses the interests and relative influence of the key domestic actors (the oil industry, environmental organizations, political parties and government bureaucracy) who wield influence in policy-making processes concerning carbon dioxide storage. Despite the level of interest aroused by the issue in Norway, the evidence suggests that policy will not move in the direction of an international carbon storage agreement. This is mainly because Norwegian policy-making in the field is dominated by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, whose current interests do not seem compatible with such a position. The fact that carbon storage can be developed in accordance with Norway's interests as a petroleum producer may, however, be a decisive factor for the political parties, government bureaucracy and the oil industry in the future.

AB  - We calculate values of forest carbon sequestration and nutrient recycling applying the replacement cost method. The value is then determined as the savings in costs by the replacement of more expensive abatement measures with these ecosystem services in cost-effective climate and nutrient programs. To this end, a dynamic optimization model is constructed, which accounts for uncertainty in sequestration. It is applied to the Stockholm-Malar region in southeast Sweden where the EU 2050 climate policy for carbon emissions and the Baltic Sea action plan for nutrient discharges are applied. The results show that the value of carbon and nutrient sequestration can correspond to approximately 0.5% of the region's gross domestic product, or 40% of the value of productive forest. The largest part of this value is attributed to carbon sequestration because of the relative stringency in targets and expensive alternative abatement measures. However, sequestration is uncertain because of stochastic weather conditions, and when society has a large risk aversion for not attaining climate and nutrient targets, the values of the forest carbon and nutrient sequestration can approach zero.

AB  - Accounting for carbon storage and the albedo effect through Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) or mandatory offset permits aims to internalize the environmental externalities of forest management. This can shift the economically optimal rotation age, and incorporate rents for a wider range of ecosystem service offerings. A mixed stand economic optimization model was used to determine the optimal stand mixture and inter-species climate regulation trade-offs. Mixed forest dynamics between deciduous silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and coniferous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) were evaluated. The sensitivity of our results to the absolute species-specific differences in albedo parameter values was also conducted. Results indicated that a synergistic climate regulation trade-off between the two species exists. The optimal rotation for the combined carbon storage and albedo effect was equivalent to that of the carbon storage only case. Differences in absolute albedo impacts were most sensitive at high discount rates, for 'climate only' management, and over increasing offset prices. These results demonstrate the importance of parameter certainty in the promotion of PES in forestry. They also show that mixed stands can promote more efficient trade-offs between forest ecosystem service offerings and provide a basis for diversifying between ecosystem functions.

AB  - The greenhouse effect is one of our most severe current environmental problems. Forests make up large ecosystems and can play an important role in mitigating the emissions of CO,, the most important greenhouse gas. Different management regimes affect the ability of forests to sequester carbon. It is important to investigate in what way we best can use forests to mitigate the greenhouse effect. It is also important to study what effect different actions, done to increase carbon sequestration, have on other offsets from forestry, such as the harvest level, the availability of forest biofuel and economic factors.
   In this study, we present an optimization model for analysis of carbon sequestration in forest biomass and forest products at a local or regional scale. The model consists of an optimizing stand-level simulator, and the solution is found using linear programming. Carbon sequestration was accounted for in terms of carbon price and its value computed as a function of carbon price and the net carbon storage in the forest. The same price was used as a cost for carbon emission originating from deterioration of wood products.
   We carried out a case study for a 3.2 million ha boreal forest region in northern Sweden. The result showed that 1.48-2.05 million tonnes of carbon per year was sequestered in the area, depending on what carbon price was used. We conclude that assigning carbon storage a monetary value and removal of carbon in forest products as a cost, increases carbon sequestration in the forest and decreases harvest levels. The effect was largest in areas with low site-quality classes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is concern in the scientific community and among forest managers about potential reductions in the provisioning of forest ecosystem services due to the loss of tree species diversity. Many studies have shown how species diversity influences forest functioning, especially productivity, but the influence of structural diversity, such as tree size heterogeneity, has received much less attention. This study focused on understanding the relationship between stand productivity and several structural characteristics of spruce-fir-beech mountain forest stands in Europe. We used a dataset of 89 long-term plots in spruce-fir-beech forests distributed along the European mountains where the three species, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), represent at least 75% of the basal area. Site-dependent conditions were accounted for in a linear mixed-effect basic model, which related the stand productivity with the morphological, climatic and pedological characteristics. The influence of tree species diversity, tree size heterogeneity, species size dominance, and species overlapping in the size distribution on stand productivity was analysed by adding variables to the basic model one by one and evaluating the change in the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The variables that resulted in significant reductions in the AIC, and that were not correlated with each other, were used to build a model to estimate stand productivity. The model showed that in spruce-fir-beech mixed mountain forests (i) when Norway spruce, silver fir and European beech are evenly present within the size distribution (high evenness) the productivity decreases, (ii) the stand productivity increases when the diameter distribution is skewed to the right (higher numbers of smaller individuals), (iii) the stand productivity increases as the proportion of basal area that is spruce increases, and (iv) stand productivity increases with the variability in diameter. We discuss the implications of our results for the management of spruce-fir-beech mountain forest in Europe and for preserving and increasing the stand productivity of these mixed forests.

AB  - The carbon sink of boreal forests can be increased by paying forest landowners for carbon sequestration and taxing carbon releases. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of carbon pricing on optimal forest management when forests are managed for maximal discounted benefits from timber production and carbon payments. A 0.5% random sample of all private forest stands of Finland was used in the analyses (48,842 stands). Calculations were performed for a 100-year time horizon. It was assumed that the carbon balance (difference between sequestrated carbon and released carbon) in the forest (trees and soil) or the carbon balance of forestry (trees, soil and wood-based products) was subsidized (positive balance) or taxed (negative balance) by 0, 50, 100 or 150 euro t(-1), corresponding to CO2 prices of 0, 13.6, 27.3 or 40.9 euro t(-1), respectively. The results showed that paying forest landowners 150 euro t(-1) of carbon sequestrated in forests would lead to the cessation of all cuttings everywhere in Finland for at least 100 years. In the northern part of the country, a carbon price of 100 euro t(-1) would be enough to make the no-cutting management economically optimal. A low carbon price had the highest relative impact (value of increased sequestration divided by the cost of carbon payments). The benefit/cost ratio of carbon subsidies was higher in the northern part of boreal zone than in the southern parts. Subsidizing within-forest carbon sequestration by 50 euro t(-1) would increase the carbon sequestration of Finnish forestry by 50%, ranging from 36% (south Finland) to 116% (north Finland). A payment of 100 euro t(-1) or more would increase carbon sequestration by 70%, which is nearly the maximum possible increase that can be obtained by carbon subsidies.

AB  - It is recognized that human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the-increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the onset of the industrial revolution. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming. With the ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, forests play a critical role in the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration at both global and local scales. It is necessary to understand the relationship between forest soil carbon dynamics and carbon sequestration capacity, and the impact of forest management practices on soil CO2 efflux for sustainable carbon management in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews a number of current issues related to (1) carbon allocation, (2) soil respiration, and (3) carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystems through forest management strategies. The contribution made by forests and forest management in sequestrating carbon to reduce the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The overall carbon cycle, carbon allocation of the above- and belowground compartments of the forests, soil carbon storage and soil respiration in forest ecosystems and impacts of forest management practices on soil respiration are described. The potential influences of forest soils on the buildup of atmospheric carbon are reviewed.

AB  - This paper presents a method for determining the subsidy required to motivate farmers to participate in timber afforestation programs designed to maximize social well-being. The method incorporates a carbon sequestration benefit function into the land expected value model in order to quantify the social benefit arising from carbon sequestration by the planted trees. This is used to calculate the optimal rotation age for newly planted forests that maximizes social utility. The minimum subsidy required to motivate farmers to participate in the afforestation program was calculated using a modified decision model that accounts for the subsidy's impact. The maximum subsidy offered by the government was taken to be the NPV of the carbon sequestration achieved by afforestation. Data on Robinia pseudoacacia L trees planted on the Loess Plateau were used in an empirical test of the model, which in this case predicts an optimal subsidy of 254.38 yuan/ha over 40 years. This would guarantee the maintenance of forest on land designated for afforestation until they reached the socially optimal rotation age. The method presented herein offers a new framework for designing afforestation subsidy programs that account for the environmental service (specially, the carbon sequestration) provided by forests.

AB  - We present a cross-system comparison of benthic species pools, species diversity, functional complexity and rarity in 2 typical Arctic coastal systems: an open shelf marginal sea and fjords (semi-enclosed, geologically younger basins remaining under strong terrestrial influences). A total of 388 van Veen grab samples were collected in the Barents Sea and 3 west Spitsbergen fjords (divided into inner and outer basins). Thirty percent of species were recorded only in fjords, questioning the common notion of the fjordic communities being merely subsets of the offshore species pools. Inner fjords, outer fjords and the open shelf hosted communities that differed significantly in terms of species composition and diversity. Species richness, examined at the scales of both the ecological zone and an individual sample, was severely depleted in inner fjordic basins. The congruence of the patterns across taxonomic groups employing different life histories (benthic vs. pelagic dispersal) pointed to habitat deterioration rather than dispersal barriers as a factor responsible for the fjordic diversity clines. The between-habitat differences in functional diversity were expressed in decreased functional evenness and a decline in suspension-feeding, sedentary and large tube-dwelling species in fjords, affecting infaunal habitat complexity. Species redundancy declined across the shelf - outer fjord - inner fjord environmental gradients, suggesting a higher resilience of shelf systems. The environmental deterioration of fjordic basins did not result in the reduction of rare species. These results should be applied to strategies for managing open shelf and fjordic habitats in the Arctic.

AB  - The influence of microhabitat type on the diversity and community structure of the harpacticoid copepod fauna associated with a cold-water coral degradation zone was investigated in the Porcupine Seabight (North-East Atlantic). Three substrate types were distinguished: dead fragments of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, skeletons of the glass sponge Aphrocallistes bocagei and the underlying sediment. At the family level, it appears that coral fragments and underlying sediment do not harbour distinctly different assemblages, with Ectinosomatidae, Ameiridae, Pseudotachidiidae, Argestidae and Miraciidae as most abundant. Conclusions on assemblage structure and diversity of the sponge skeletons are limited as only two samples were available. Similarity analysis at species level showed a strong variation in the sediment samples, which did not harbour a distinctly different assemblage in opposition to the coral and sponge samples. Several factors (sediment infill on the hard substrates, mobility of the copepods, limited sample sizes) are proposed to explain this apparent lack of a distinct difference between the microhabitats. Coral fragments and sediment were both characterised by high species diversity and low species dominance, which might indicate that copepod diversity is not substantially influenced by hydrodynamical stress. The additive partitioning of species diversity showed that by adding locations species richness was greatly enhanced. The harpacticoid community in the cold-water coral degradation zone is highly diverse and includes 157 species, 62 genera and 19 families. Information from neighbouring soft-bottom regions is necessary to assess whether total species diversity is increased by the presence of these complex habitat-providing substrates.

AB  - To achieve resilience goals, urban planners and decision-makers need accurate information on the benefits provided by urban trees and on the effects that management may have on them. This study investigates the impacts of management and disturbances on urban forest structure and function in Turku, Finland. Using a comprehensive urban tree database and the i-Tree software suite, we assessed the current structure and estimated the value of ecosystem services provided by Turku's urban forest. Additionally, we simulated changes in the urban forest over a 50-year period, considering different tree planting scenarios and the potential outbreak of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB). Turku's urban forest comprised 38,438 public trees, dominated by Acer platanoides, Pinus sylvestris, Tilia x europaea, and Betula pendula. The estimated carbon storage was 12,336 t, valued at 1.98 million euro, with an annual sequestration rate of 284 t (45,549 euro/year). The trees also removed 8.97 t of pollutants annually, with an estimated value of 153,273 euro. At the current rate of tree planting, the number of trees would decline over the course of 50 years resulting in a gradual decrease in the provision of ecosystem services. Although doubling the tree planting rate could slowly increase carbon storage and sequestration even under moderate ALB attack, it was insufficient to offset the damage caused by ALB if tree mortality rate reaches 50%. Compared to carbon storage and sequestration, changes in urban forest age structure had a more immediate impact on the removal of air pollution. These findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing investments in urban forests on grounds of their capacity to provide diverse ecosystem services. Incorporating these findings into decision-making processes would promote sustainable and resilient urban environments.

AB  - Forestry sequestrates carbon from the atmosphere and stores it in living tree biomass, dead organic matter (DOM) and wood-based products. A part of the sequestration might be "additional", i.e., increased sequestration compared to the business as usual forestry. This study developed a methodology for calculating the additional part of the carbon sequestration of Finnish forestry. Additionality was defined to be equal to increasing the carbon stocks beyond a reference level, which was equal to the carbon socks of current Finnish forestry. Models were developed for calculating the reference carbon stocks of living tree biomass, DOM and wood-based products, using site fertility and temperature sum as predictors. New models were also developed for initializing the carbon stocks of DOM and wood-based products. These models were used in simulations that predict the future changes of the carbon stocks in a given forest management scenario. The model system developed in this study makes it possible to calculate the future carbon stocks and additional carbon sequestration of any Finnish forest area in alternative forest management scenarios. The use of the system was demonstrated in three case study forests for two different management scenarios.

AB  - Increasing the use of forest biomass for energy production is an important mitigation strategy against climate change. Sustainable use of natural resources requires that these policies are evaluated, planned and implemented, taking into account the boundary conditions of the ecological systems affected. This paper describes the development and application of a quantitative modelling framework for evaluating integrated impacts of forest biomass removal scenarios on four key environmental sustainability/ecosystem service indicators: (i) carbon sequestration and balance, (ii) soil nutrient balances (base cations and nitrogen), (iii) nutrient leaching to surface waters (nitrogen and phosphorus), and (iv) dead wood biomass (used as proxy indicator for impacts on species diversity). The system is based on the use of spatial data sets, mass balance calculations, loading coefficients and dynamic modelling. The approach is demonstrated using data from an intensively studied region (Hameenlinna municipality) encompassing the Lammi LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) site in southern Finland. Forest biomass removal scenarios were derived from a management-oriented large-scale forestry model (MELA) based on sample plot and stand-level data from national forest inventories. These scenarios have been developed to guide future Finnish forest management with respect to bioenergy use. Using harvest residues for district heat production reduced fossil carbon emissions but also the carbon sink of forests in the case study area. Calculations of the net removal of base cations of the different scenarios ranged between -36 to -43 meq m(-2) a(-1), indicating that the supply of base cations (soil weathering + deposition) would be enough to sustain also energy-wood harvesting. Greatly increased nutrient removal values and increasing nitrogen limitation problems were however predicted. Clear-cuttings and site preparation were predicted to increase the load of total nitrogen (4.0%) and total phosphorus (4.5%) to surface waters, compared with background leaching. The amount of dead wood has been identified as a key factor for forest species diversity in Finland. A scenario maximising harvest residues used for bioenergy production, would decrease stem dead wood biomass by about 40%, compared with a business-as-usual scenario. Clear trade-off situations could be observed in the case study area between maximising the use of energy-wood and minimising impacts on species diversity, soil carbon and nutrient stores, and nutrient leaching. The developed model system allows seeking for optimised solutions with respect to different management options and sustainability considerations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding threatened species diversity is important for long-term conservation planning. Geodiversitythe diversity of Earth surface materials, forms, and processesmay be a useful biodiversity surrogate for conservation and have conservation value itself. Geodiversity and species richness relationships have been demonstrated; establishing whether geodiversity relates to threatened species' diversity and distribution pattern is a logical next step for conservation. We used 4 geodiversity variables (rock-type and soil-type richness, geomorphological diversity, and hydrological feature diversity) and 4 climatic and topographic variables to model threatened species diversity across 31 of Finland's national parks. We also analyzed rarity-weighted richness (a measure of site complementarity) of threatened vascular plants, fungi, bryophytes, and all species combined. Our 1-km(2) resolution data set included 271 threatened species from 16 major taxa. We modeled threatened species richness (raw and rarity weighted) with boosted regression trees. Climatic variables, especially the annual temperature sum above 5 degrees C, dominated our models, which is consistent with the critical role of temperature in this boreal environment. Geodiversity added significant explanatory power. High geodiversity values were consistently associated with high threatened species richness across taxa. The combined effect of geodiversity variables was even more pronounced in the rarity-weighted richness analyses (except for fungi) than in those for species richness. Geodiversity measures correlated most strongly with species richness (raw and rarity weighted) of threatened vascular plants and bryophytes and were weakest for molluscs, lichens, and mammals. Although simple measures of topography improve biodiversity modeling, our results suggest that geodiversity data relating to geology, landforms, and hydrology are also worth including. This reinforces recent arguments that conserving nature's stage is an important principle in conservation.

AB  - Urban areas have experienced exponential growth since the industrial revolution and by virtue, the urban population has followed. Current projections suggest that this growth has yet to reach its peak implying that urban developments will continue to sprawl into untouched territories. This growth and subsequent sprawl will undoubtedly come at the expense of forested areas. This study presents a carbon storage factor indicator for new urban developments. It is a novel concept which integrates urban planning, land use changes and wooden construction. The factor sets a carbon storage requirement for new urban areas that are developed at the expense of forested areas. The study is conducted in four parts. First, we estimate the carbon storage potential of forest areas via existing literature and databases. Then we collect all new development and construction estimates up to the year 2050 for the whole metropolitan region in Finland. Next, we conduct scenario analyzes for different demand levels of wood in projected residential developments. Finally, we compare the carbon storage potential of the future building stock to the forest areas planned for development. The data used is provided by the regional authority. The results detail that the future residential building stock can store between 128-733 kt of carbon. The lower level implies that current construction methods can only partially preserve the carbon storage of an area in buildings. However, the higher level suggests future buildings to be able to exceed the carbon storage potential of forest areas by nearly 47 tC ha(-1). The study reminds that an increased use of wood is dependent on sustainable forest management practices. Furthermore, it is not our purpose to promote urban development into entirely new areas but rather encourage urban planners to consider the carbon balance when it is the only viable option.

AB  - Since the late 1970s, the Chinese government has implemented massive afforestation projects to address grievous environmental disasters, protect human health and provide long-term environmental security. Having a better understanding of the total carbon sink from the afforestation projects is fundamental to assess its global carbon benefit. Here, the sequestered carbon stock based on Chinese national forest inventory data is calculated by using three comparable volume-derived biomass models. Results show that the carbon sink contribution from these Chinese afforestation projects was 1.02 Pg C by the end of 2008 and 0.79 Pg C on average from 1981 to 2008 with a cumulative rate of 0.028 Pg C/a, which corresponds to 2 % of the total industrial carbon emissions from China during the same period. The financial value of carbon sequestration from these projects can be estimated by its value in carbon taxes of Finland and is potentially 190 billion RMB from 1981 to 2008, which is 43.4 % of the original investment. Hence although China's afforestation projects make only modest contributions to offsetting industrial growth in carbon, the carbon sequestered, if valued according to some markets, is a significant fraction of the total project costs.

AB  - Removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing carbon in vegetation and soil are important ecosystem services provided by urban green space. However, knowledge on the capacity of trees and soils to store carbon in urban parks - especially in the northern latitudes - is scarce. We assessed the amount of organic carbon stored in trees and soil of constructed urban parks under cold climatic conditions in Finland. More specifically, we investigated the effects of management, vegetation type and time since construction on the amount of carbon stored in park trees and soil. We conducted two tree surveys and collected soil samples (0-90 cm) in constructed parks managed by the city of Helsinki. The estimated overall carbon density was approximately 130 t per park hectare, when the carbon stock of trees was 22 to 28 t ha(-1) and that of soil 104 t ha(-1) at the very least. The soil to tree carbon storage ratio varied from 7.1 to 7.5 for vegetated, pervious grounds and from 3.7 to 5.0 for entire park areas. The effects of park management and vegetation type could not be entirely separated in our data, but time was shown to have a distinct, positive effect on tree and soil carbon stocks. The results indicate that park soils can hold remarkable carbon stocks in a cold climate. It also seems that park soil carbon holding capacity largely exceeds that of forested soils in Finland. Preservation and augmentation of carbon stocks in urban parks implies avoidance of drastic tree and soil renovation measures.

AB  - Interest in organic farming is growing rapidly in Europe. The resulting expansion of the organic farming area has been expected to enhance the biodiversity of agricultural habitats. Organic cropping practices can be hypothesized to support a higher number of weed species than conventional cropping and also to favor herbicide-susceptible and less-nitrophilous species. The diversity and species composition of weed communities were compared in spring cereal fields cultivated by organic, conventional cereal and conventional dairy cropping methods in southern Finland between 1997 and 1999. Samples were taken before (May-June) and after (July-August) the treatment of conventional fields with herbicides. The number of species was used as a measure of species diversity. The total and mean numbers of species between cropping practices were compared by applying rarefaction and ANCOVA, respectively. In organically cultivated, fields the adjusted mean number of species per field exceeded that in conventionally cultivated fields by about two species in both May-June and July-August. The total number of species was higher in organically cultivated fields only in July-August. The species composition of organically cultivated fields was closer to that of conventional dairy than to that of conventional cereal fields. Species susceptible to herbicides (e.g. Chenopodium album) were abundant in organically cultivated fields in both sampling periods whereas the relative abundance of some of them declined in conventional fields from May-June to July-August. In conventional fields, the relative abundances of Viola arvensis, Stellaria media and Elymus repens increased from May-June to July-August. Only weak support was found for the hypothesis that organic cropping favors less-nitrophilous weed species. It is concluded that organic cropping promotes weed species diversity at an early phase of cropping history but that a change in species composition would require a longer period of organic cropping.

AB  - We show how the spatial structure of species diversity can be analyzed using the correlation between the log abundances of the species in the communities, assuming that two communities at different localities can be described by a bivariate lognormal species abundance distribution. A useful property of this approach is that the log abundances of the species at two localities can be considered as samples from a bivariate normal distribution defined by only five parameters. The variances and the correlation can be estimated by maximum likelihood methods even if there is no information about the sampling intensity and the number of unobserved species. This method also enables estimation of over-dispersion in the sampling relative to a Poisson distribution that allows sampling adjustment of the estimate of beta-diversity. Furthermore, we also obtain a partitioning of species diversity into additive components of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity. For instance, if the correlation between the log abundances of the species is close to one, the same species will be common and rare in the two communities and the beta-diversity will be low. We illustrate this approach by analysing similarities of communities of rare and endangered species of oak-living beetles in south-eastern Norway. The number of recorded species was estimated to be only 48.1% of the total number of species actually present in these communities. The correlations among communities dropped rather quickly with distance with a scaling of order 200 km. This illustrates large spatial heterogeneity in species composition, which should be accounted for in the design of schemes of such devices for assessing species diversity in these habitat-types.

AB  - The distribution of crustose Caliciales has been surveyed in 100 spruce forest patches in Sor-Trondelag, central Norway. Relationships between occurrence of the species and a number of site and stand variables were analysed by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and direct gradient analysis. Species diversity was significantly higher in old forests and in forests at higher altitudes compared to young forests and forests at lower altitudes. Old trees and snags are considered to be the most important structural components in old forests promoting species diversity of the Caliciales. Threatened or vulnerable species, such as Chaenotheca gracillima, Cybebe gracilenta, Sclerophora coniophaea and S. peronella were confined to forest on rich soils showing no correlation with forest stand age. Chaenotheca brachypoda and C. trichialis were found to be the most typical old forest species among the Caliciales. Humidiphilous species are considered to be less affected by forestry in a humid climate. A change in forestry practice towards methods imitating the natural dynamic processes is considered necessary to maintain species diversity of the Caliciales in boreal forests.

AB  - Vegetation samples collected along altitudinal transects through the treeline ecotone in the central Scandes Mountains, Norway, were used to analyse the relationships between species diversity, species turnover and the performance of the tree layer. The study area has a long history of extensive grazing by domestic animals. The floristic composition showed a continuous change along the boreal-alpine gradient. The number of species was more or less constant throughout 600 altitudinal m centred around the treeline, and the Aoristic similarity between neighbouring altitudes did not show any abrupt changes at any particular altitude. The treeline position (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) spanned 190 altitudinal m (range 980-1170 m a.s.l.). The number of trees and the basal area each decreased continuously with increasing altitude from 300 altitudinal m below the treeline. The number of birch saplings also decreased from c. 150 m below the treeline towards higher altitudes. Viable, but browsed populations of birch were present along the whole length of all transects, irrespective of aspect and geological substrate, with saplings present up to summit positions at 420 altitudinal m above the treeline. Due to browsing by sheep, mean sapling height at all altitudes above the treeline was 0.2 m. The results are discussed in terms of land use and climate change. It is concluded that future vegetation responses to diminished grazing pressure are likely to override responses forced by changing climate. Such responses could easily be misinterpreted as being governed by climate change, rather than by changes in land use.

AB  - Cities have become increasingly interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration and storage in urban vegetation and soil as part of their climate mitigation actions. However, most of our knowledge of the biogenic carbon cycle is based on data and models from forested ecosystems, despite urban nature and microclimates differing greatly from those in natural or forested ecosystems. There is a need for modelling tools that can correctly consider temporal variations in the urban carbon cycle and take specific urban conditions into account. The main aims of our study were to (1) examine the carbon sequestration potential of two commonly used street tree species (Tilia x vulgaris and Alnus glutinosa) growing in three different growing media by taking into account the complexity of urban conditions and (2) evaluate the urban land surface model SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme) and the soil carbon model Yassol5 in simulating the carbon sequestration of these street tree plantings at temporal scales (diurnal, monthly, and annual). SUEWS provides data on the urban microclimate and on street tree photosynthesis and respiration, whereas soil carbon storage is estimated with Yasso. These models were used to study the urban carbon cycle throughout the expected lifespan of street trees (2002-2031). Within this period, model performances were evaluated against transpiration estimated from sap flow, soil carbon content, and soil moisture measurements from two street tree sites located in Helsinki, Finland.
   The models were able to capture the variability in the urban carbon cycle and transpiration due to changes in environmental conditions, soil type, and tree species. Carbon sequestration potential was estimated for an average street tree and for the average of the diverse soils present in the study area. Over the study period, soil respiration dominated carbon exchange over carbon sequestration due to the high initial carbon loss from the soil after street construction. However, the street tree plantings turned into a modest sink of carbon from the atmosphere on an annual scale, as tree and soil respiration approximately balanced the photosynthesis. The compensation point when street tree plantings turned from an annual source into a sink was reached more rapidly - after 12 years - by Alnus trees, while this point was reached by Tilia trees after 14 years. However, these moments naturally vary from site to site depending on the growing media, planting density, tree species, and climate. Overall, the results indicate the importance of soil in urban carbon sequestration estimations.

AB  - The overall aim of this work was to assess the effects of stump and root extraction on the long-term carbon sequestration and average carbon storage in the integrated production of energy biomass and stemwood (pulpwood and sawlogs) under different thinning options (unthinned, current thinning and 30% increased thinning thresholds from current thresholds). The growth and development of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) stands on a fertile site (Oxalis-myrtillus) in central Finland (Joensuu region: 6239?N, 2937?E) was simulated for two consecutive rotation periods (80+80years/160years). Stemwood and energy biomass production, carbon sequestration, and average storage and emission dynamics related to the entire production process of biomass were assessed. The assessment was done by employing a life cycle assessment tool, which combines simulation outputs from an ecosystem model and the related technosystem emissions. It was found that stump and root harvesting constituted 21-36% of the total biomass production (energy biomass and stemwood) depending on the thinning regimes and rotation period. No considerable effect was found in stemwood production when stump and root extraction was compared to the regime in which stumps and roots were left at the site. Stump and root extraction did not affect carbon sequestration on the following rotation and, in fact, an increase in forest growth was found for the unthinned and 30% increased thresholds compared to the first rotation. The results also showed that if current thinning threshold is increased, win-win situations are possible, especially when climate change mitigation is the main concern. The substitution of coal with energy biomass is possible without reducing carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. The utilization of energy biomass, including stumps and roots, instead of coal could reduce up to 33% of emissions over two rotation periods depending on the thinning regimes. Even if stumps and roots were excluded, a maximum of 19% carbon emissions could be reduced by using only logging residues.

AB  - Given the high percentage of private forest ownership in Finland, family forest owners have an important role in mitigating climate change. The study aims to explore Finnish family forest owners' perceptions on climate change and their opinions on increasing carbon storage in their forests through new kinds of management activities and policy instruments. The data consists of thematic face-to-face interviews among Helsinki metropolitan area forest owners (n = 15). These city-dwellers were expected to be more aware of and more interested in climate change mitigation than forest owners at large. Forests as carbon fluxes appear to be a familiar concept to most of the forest owners, but carbon storage in their own forests was a new idea. Four types concerning forest owners' view on storing carbon in their forests could be identified. The Pioneer utilizes forestland versatilely and has already adopted practices to mitigate climate change. The Potential is concerned about climate change, but this is not seen in forest practices applied. The Resistant is generally aware of climate change but sees a fundamental contradiction between carbon storing and wood production. The Indifferent Owner believes that climate change is taking place but does not acknowledge a relation between climate change and the owner's forests.

AB  - Extreme or recurrent drought events are the principal source of stress on forests, impairing their overall health. They result in financial losses for forest owners and ecosystem service losses for society. Most of the forested area in the Grand-Est region, France, is covered by European beech, which is projected to decline in the future due to repeated drought events driven by climate change. Diversification is a management option that can reduce the drought-induced risk of dieback. Two types of diversification were separately and jointly analyzed: a mixture of beech species with oak species and a mixture of different tree diameter classes. Two types of losses were also considered: financial and in terms of carbon storage under different occurrences of drought events derived from climate change scenarios. We combined an individual-based model of forest growth with a forest economic approach (i.e., land expectation value or LEV), which we adapted to the stochastic context by developing a doubly-weighted LEV. The maximization of the LEV made it possible to identify the most effective adaptation strategies in terms of timber revenue and carbon storage by means of three different carbon values (i.e., market value, shadow price, and social cost). The results showed that diversification increases timber returns and reduces the loss in timber volume due to the drought-induced risk of forest dieback. However, diversification negatively affects carbon storage. Integrating the value of carbon storage increases the value of the forest stand, but only a high carbon value has a significant economic impact.

AB  - The extrinsic determinants hypothesis emphasizes the essential role of environmental heterogeneity in species' colonization. Consequently, high resident species diversity can increase community susceptibility to colonizations because good habitats may support more species that are functionally similar to colonizers. On the other hand, colonization success is also likely to depend on species traits. We tested the relative importance of environmental characteristics and species traits in determining colonization success using census data of 587 vascular plant species collected about 70 yr apart from 471 islands in the archipelago of SW Finland. More specifically, we explored potential new colonization as a function of island properties (e.g. location, area, habitat diversity, number of resident species per unit area), species traits (e.g. plant height, life-form, dispersal vector, Ellenberg indicator values, association with human impact), and species' historical distributions (number of inhabited islands, nearest occurrence). Island properties and species' historical distributions were more effective than plant traits in explaining colonization outcomes. Contrary to the extrinsic determinants hypothesis, colonization success was neither associated with resident species diversity nor habitat diversity per se, although colonization was lowest on sparsely vegetated islands. Our findings lead us to propose that while plant traits related to dispersal and establishment may enhance colonization, predictions of plant colonizations primarily require understanding of habitat properties and species' historical distributions.

AB  - Forest management decisions about species mixture and harvest time are usually bound to economic con-siderations. Ecosystem services (ES), aside from timber production, are hardly considered. Although the con-sideration of multiple ES became common in recent years, it is still unclear how ES can be integrated into forest optimization and how this changes forest management. To show possible changes when different ES are con-sidered, our study examined the impact of the market value of three ES (timber production, carbon storage and groundwater recharge) on management decisions under different levels of risk. We included two common European tree species (European beech and Norway spruce) as well as market risks and the risk of stand failure in our optimization. We examined how the optimal species composition and harvest schedule change when considering different ES. The inclusion of different ES changes the optimal harvest schedule and species composition. Including carbon storage leads to small changes in harvest schedule and species composition. Adding groundwater recharge led to a diversified portfolio but it consisted completely of European beech. We also discuss ecological complexities so far not considered in our approach and their possible consequences for the results.

AB  - Rare moss species occurring in Terra Nova National Park, a boreal reserve in eastern Newfoundland, are extraneous members of the flora belonging to either temPerate, arctic-montane, or montane elements. All are at or near their range limits. Of species from these three geographical elements, rare taxa occupy a narrower range of habitats and occur in a lower proportion of suitable stands than do non-rare species. The rare temperate group shows highest species diversity in, and is largely confined to, old Abies-Hylocomium forests. The arctic-montane group exhibits greatest diversity in exposed coastal sites, while diversity of the montane group is highest in freshwater habitats. Relative richness of rare species is high in individual stands of all the habitats occupied by the arctic-montane and montane groups, and varies little among stands. However, relative diversity of rare temperate species tends to be low in individual Abies-Hylocomium forest stands, and both species composition and species richness exhibit considerable among-stand variation. Dispersal potential, as indicated by diaspore type, is negatively associated with rarity, and positively associated with both the number of habitats and proportion of suitable stands occupied. Some possible reasons for the observed patterns of habitat use, and the implications of these results for management and conservation of the rare moss flora of Terra Nova National Park, are examined.

AB  - Plant communities of 57 field boundaries, in four regions of Finland,were sampled for this Study focusing oil factors affecting Species diversity and community composition. All the boundaries were buffer strips established following the guidance of an Agri-Environmental Support Scheme. Data oil edaphic factors, boundary management practices and spatial coordinates were used as explanatory variables in the data analyses using variation partitioning by Redundancy Analysis and univariate statistics.
   The Variation of the Plant species composition and diversity was found to be strongly spatially Structured. On the variation of species composition, spatial variables alone explained 35.0% and jointly with environmental factors 32.4% of the variation in species composition. Moreover, mowing, soil pH and P content and boundary width were shown to be important factors determining species composition. The species diversity was the lowest where the land use lot agricultural production Was most intensive and classification of species traits indicated high soil nitrogen levels.
   On the basis Of thiS Study, biodiversity in boundaries Could be enhanced by appropriate management techniques and greater boundary width. Regional differences in agricultural land use Should also be taken into account When planning practices For improving biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest management requires a dense forest road system which combines truck roads and skidding tracks. However, harvesting machines cause damage to forest stands and soils. The aim of this study is to examine the consequences skidding tracks have on net nitrogen mineralization and vegetation composition compared to adjacent forest stands. A beech forest on limestone as well as beech and Norway spruce forests on acidic soils were investigated in south Lower Saxony, Germany. Along the wheel tracks the net nitrogen mineralization is markedly reduced compared to the undisturbed stands. Although nitrogen mineralization is found to be low especially along the wheel tracks, ruderal plants with high nitrogen indicator values have established themselves. Along the skidding tracks, numerous species from fringe and ruderal communities. grasslands and wet sites occur while the stands are dominated by typical forest plant species. Therefore, species diversity is higher along the skidding tracks than in the adjacent stands.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation is a key objective for sustainable forest management, but the multi-dimensional and multi-scale character of biodiversity renders full assessment difficult at large scale. Therefore, indicators are often used to monitor biodiversity. Important cost-benefit synergies can be achieved if indicators are derived from existing data. In this study, a model for classifying forest stand structures was developed and tested as an indicator of overall plant species diversity at stand level. The model combines four stand structure parameters: canopy coverage, age of canopy trees, tree species composition and canopy stratification. Using data from the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden and General Linear Mixed Model, plant species diversity (Shannon diversity index, SHDI) and composition (Sorensen-Dice index, SDI) were tested between 26 different stand structure types and nine soil classes. The results showed that mature stands with a stratified canopy had the highest plant species diversity across the soil classes, particularly if they comprised mixed coniferous and broadleaved species with a semi-open canopy. In contrast, young (<30 years) single-layered stands had consistently low species diversity. Of the four stand structure parameters in the model, age of canopy trees was most influential for SHDI value, followed by canopy stratification, tree species composition and canopy coverage. According to the SDI values, different stand structure types represented different species composition regardless of soil class and species diversity (SHDI value). However, most SDI values were higher than 0.5, indicating that fewer than 50% of the species changed between stand structure types. The stand parameters included in the model can probably be extracted from national forest inventories in many countries and understood without specialist taxonomic knowledge, making the model applicable in practice to support forest management decision-making on enhancing forest biodiversity at stand level.

AB  - We analyzed patterns of species diversity in a compiled data set covering the European coast (from Norway to Crete) that was made available in the framework of the MarBEF European Network of Excellence. The focus was on the distribution patterns of species diversity over large areas across Europe. The objectives of our analysis were two-fold. First, we attempted to separate the effects of species-area relationships from that of species accumulation. Second, we explored the relationship between species diversity and productivity, and compared this to the proposed explaining factors (depth, survey area and latitude). The following conclusions are drawn. (1) Within a given habitat (subtidal soft sediment), the distribution of marine macrofaunal species richness in different areas between 3 and 200 m in average depth throughout Europe is shown to follow general rules derived from observations and experiments mostly based on terrestrial communities; (2) soft-bottom macrofauna accumulate in the subtidal environment (tip to 200 in) following the Arrhenius plot model at a rate (approximate to 0.5) corresponding to about a 3-fold increase in the number of species when the sampling area increases by 1 order of magnitude; (3) the distribution of the intrinsic species richness (point species richness) between the selected data sets (subtidal soft sediment) is significantly correlated with the levels of organic flux reaching the sea bottom; and (4) the close relationship between depth and the fraction of surface primary production that reaches the sea bottom is proposed as an explanation for the previously described increase of species richness with depth.

AB  - The importance of natural disturbances for biodiversity is well-documented in the disturbance ecology literature. Natural disturbances such as fire, wind, and flooding strongly influence ecosystems by creating short and long-term ecological processes. Conservation management of protected areas should consider the importance of natural disturbances since natural shifts in ecosystems are, in a long-term perspective, necessary to maintain high biodiversity. The purpose of this study is to explore how and if natural disturbances are incorporated in the management of Swedish national parks and to identify possible examples of barriers for this incorporation. The design of the study is a multiple comparative case study based on a document study and completed with qualitative interviews. The cases consist of propositions and management plans for 15 Swedish national parks established between 1962 and 2018. The document analysis generated four main categories: historic/future and positive/negative perceptions of natural disturbances. The results indicate that there are positive perceptions concerning the inclusion of disturbance ecology in the management of national parks. However, there are also obstacles and challenges around natural disturbances within Swedish national parks. These obstacles are, in some cases, explained by practical implications such as the closeness to surrounding societies and in others explained by paradoxes such as visitors' perceptions of national parks and the wilderness.

AB  - Genetically improved material has been proven to financially outperform unimproved material in timber production according to various studies. Genetic improvements in carbon sequestration are also promising, implying a possibility for further financial gains. Research Highlights: Including carbon pricing (i.e., timber production combined with carbon sequestration) with genetically improved material improves financial performance compared to pure timber production. Furthermore, the proportion of carbon benefit (%) of absolute bare land value fluctuates between 27% and 42%, indicating a substantial role of carbon sequestration to financial performance. Background and Objectives: Until now, economic analyses of the impact of tree improvement have mainly dealt with growth performance: volume yield or height growth. Yet planted forests can have a significant contribution to carbon sequestration, which will play a major role in carbon markets. This study focuses on comparing the financial performance between genetically improved and unimproved reforestation material when stand management is optimized according to timber production or to joint production (timber and carbon sequestration together). Another goal is to reveal possible differences in financial performance related to climatic conditions along the south-north gradient. Materials and Methods: The stand projections are based on simulations with and without genetic gains for joint production (timber + carbon) and merely timber production in eight locations in Finland. Stand-level optimization is applied for financial analyses. Results: Genetically improved reforestation material considerably enhanced financial performance when the joint production of timber and carbon was applied, regardless of the climatic region. Conclusions: If carbon pricing became a reality, there would be a distinctive shift in bare land values, which is further boosted by a genetic gain.

AB  - Bayesian belief network (Fully Connected Belief Networks, FC BeNe) was used to estimate uncertainty in the functioning of established buffer zones in Finland. Four experts in the field of water protection and four in biodiversity were asked to assess the roles of 25 key variables involved in the functioning of buffer zones. The matrix comprised five levels of information: field properties, buffer zone properties, management measures, site data and concerns. The eight experts were asked to estimate probability distributions and causal relationships between the 25 variables, which included in particular erosion, particle bound P, dissolved P, and plant, insect and bird species diversity. Any of the three phases of the analysis; prior distributions, links and posterior distributions are end products which are usable as such.
   The highest uncertainties were attributed to management measures, e.g. sowing leys, meadow plants, trees and/or bushes and soil removal from the upper end of the field in order to create nutrient-poor meadows. Uncertainties were also seen in P-status, fertilizer and manure changes, transport of dissolved phosphorus, particle bound phosphorus, bird species diversity and landscape. All experts thought that erosion affects particle bound phosphorus, but there was wide deviation in the link strength values, 0.05-0.7, which clearly reflects a lack of knowledge. Two of the experts assumed particle bound P to become partly dissolved, the other two did not. The effect of buffer zones on transport of dissolved phosphorus was not clear. The link strength direction of the variables grazing and rotational grazing to dissolved P varied between the experts.
   According to the expert evaluations, positive impacts caused by buffer zones were probable in erosion, and in plant and insect species diversity, which is in agreement with existing empirical studies. Experts expected plant height to be beneficial to bird species diversity, but disagreed as to the effect of plant height on plant and insect species diversity. Biodiversity experts considered that steep slopes produced more erosion, more leaching, and hence more patches for biodiversity contrary to water pollution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Tree stand dynamics, changes in the ground vegetation and soils, and species diversity of wood-decaying fungi were studied in pristine middle boreal spruce forests affected by a surface fire in the Vodlozersky National Park (Arkhangelsk Region, Russia) in 2011. In the third year after the fire, the burnt area was dominated by birch, which contributed an average of 72% to the total amount of major tree species regeneration. In sites affected by a high-severity fire, the ground vegetation cover did not exceed 40%, with Chamaenerion angustifolium (L.) Scop. and Marchantia polymorpha L. dominating in the first years after. By the tenth year, the diversity of the newly forming tree layer increased from 5 to 11 species and natural thinning of deciduous tree regeneration was already underway, although its amount was still over 100,000 plants per hectare throughout. By the end of the first post-fire decade, Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L. accounted for 11% of the total regeneration. The occurrence and cover of pyrogenic species Chamaenerion angustifolium and Marchantia polymorpha declined sharply at this stage. Vegetation in sites affected by mid-severity fire was mostly regenerating through propagation of the survivor Avenella flexuosa (L.) Drejer, Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. vitis-idaea, etc. In the burnt area, the species diversity of wood-destroying fungi was reduced compared to the adjacent unburned areas, and it was the same in both heavily and moderately burnt areas. This is probably due to the fact that the downed deadwood in post-fire sites was trunks of the same age and in the same degree of decay whereas the total amount of downed deadwood in the control (unburnt forest) was lower but featuring all stages of decay and, furthermore, there were plenty of fungi-populated dead standing and weakened overmature trees.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate community structure and dynamics of beetle associates of scolytids over the elevational gradient, in the montane environment. The sampling plots were situated in seven elevation zones (from the bottom to the upper border of the forest cover) in two valleys of the Tatra National Park, Poland. The insects were collected with bark peeling from lying Norway spruce trees. One hundred and sixty-four species were found, including 15 primary scolytid species. While species richness was decreasing up the elevation range, species diversity index showed its peak in middle elevations, although the highest values were in the lowest elevation zone. The density of the community increased over the season, reaching maximum values in September at the upper plots. There was a shift in community composition from lowland/widespread to montane/boreal species dominating the community at higher elevations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the relationship between species diversity and biomass productivity has been extensively studied in grasslands, the impact of tree species diversity on forest productivity, as well as the main drivers of this relationship, are still under discussion. It is widely accepted that the magnitude of the relationship between tree diversity and forest stand productivity is context specific and depends on environmental conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still not fully understood. Competition reduction and facilitation have been identified as key mechanisms driving the diversity-productivity relationship. However, contrasting results have been reported with respect to the extent to which competition reduction and facilitation determine the diversity-productivity relationship. They appear to depend on regional climate, soil fertility, functional diversity of the tree species involved, and developmental stage of the forest. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge and to suggest a conceptual framework to explain the various processes leading to higher productivity of species-rich forests compared with average yields of their respective monocultures. This framework provides three pathways for possible development of the diversity-productivity relationship under a changing climate.

AB  - Background: Studies on mosquito species diversity in Europe often focus on a specific habitat, region or country. Moreover, different trap types are used for these sampling studies, making it difficult to compare and validate results across Europe. To facilitate comparisons of trapping sites and community analysis, the present study used two trap types for monitoring mosquito species diversity in three habitat types for three different countries in Europe.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were trapped using Biogents Sentinel (BGS), and Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus (MMLP) traps at a total of 27 locations in Sweden, the Netherlands and Italy, comprising farm, peri-urban and wetland habitats. From July 2014 to June 2015 all locations were sampled monthly, except for the winter months. Indices of species richness, evenness and diversity were calculated, and community analyses were carried out with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) techniques.
   Results: A total of 11,745 female mosquitoes were trapped during 887 collections. More than 90% of the mosquitoes belonged to the genera Culex and Aedes, with Culex pipiens being the most abundant species. The highest mosquito diversity was found in Sweden. Within Sweden, species diversity was highest in wetland habitats, whereas in the Netherlands and Italy this was highest at farms. The NMDS analyses showed clear differences in mosquito communities among countries, but not among habitat types. The MMLP trapped a higher diversity of mosquito species than the BGS traps. Also, MMLP traps trapped higher numbers of mosquitoes, except for the genera Culex and Culiseta in Italy.
   Conclusions: A core mosquito community could be identified for the three countries, with Culex pipiens as the most abundant species. Differences in mosquito species communities were more defined by the three countries included in the study than by the three habitat types. Differences in mosquito community composition across countries may have implications for disease emergence and further spread throughout Europe. Future research should, therefore, focus on how field data of vector communities can be incorporated into models, to better assess the risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate what features of the urban forest remnants of Stockholm (Sweden) were important to preserve bird species diversity, in terms of landscape pattern and habitat quality.
   Breeding forest birds were surveyed in 50. forested sample sites (2-2000 ha) in an urban matrix. In 21 of the smaller sites (2-200 ha), Vegetation structure and composition were recorded. A spatial analysis was made using, a geographical information system (GIS).
   Number of forest bird species was closely related to forest area and to the area-related parameters forest core area, isolation and occurrence of wetlands. By contrast, relative species richness showed no correlation with forest area, but to multi-layered deciduous. forest habitats with. a large amount of dead wood, associated with natural shoreline.

AB  - Forests provide a multitude of ecosystem services. In Sweden, the goal to replace fossil fuels could induce substantial changes in the current management and use of forests. Therefore, methods and tools are needed to assess synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services for policy and planning alternatives. The aim of this study was to develop methods for integrated sustainability assessment of forest management strategies for long-term provisioning of various ecosystem services. For this purpose, the Landscape simulation and Ecological Assessment (LEcA) tool was developed to analyse synergies and trade-offs among five ecosystem services: bioenergy feedstock and industrial wood production, forest carbon storage, recreation areas and habitat networks. Forest growth and management were simulated for two scenarios; the EAF-tot scenario dominated by even-aged forestry (EAF), and the CCF-int scenario with a combination of continuous-cover forestry (CCF) and intensified EAF. The results showed trade-offs between industrial wood and bioenergy production on one side and habitat, recreation and carbon storage on the other side.

AB  - Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were studied in relation to different site index conditions, stand densities and silvicultural treatments for the main forest species in northwest Spain. Site quality, stand density and silvicultural treatments affected biomass production and carbon sequestration and, therefore, optimal rotation length. Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were highest and optimal rotations were shortest for the best site indexes, highest initial stand densities and the silvicultural treatments that involved least disturbance. Fast-growing species can be used as both energy crops (biomass) and carbon sinks, which contribute to mitigating climate change. However, as slow-growing species act as sinks for longer, they are preferable for planting in environments that are less suitable for fast-growing species.

AB  - The boreal biome, representing approximately one-third of remaining global forests, provides a number of crucial ecosystem services. A particular challenge in forest ecosystems is to reconcile demand for an increased timber production with provisioning of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, there is still little knowledge about how forest management could help solve this challenge. Hence, studies that investigate how to manage forests to reduce trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity are urgently needed to help forest owners and policy makers take informed decisions. We applied seven alternative forest management regimes using a forest growth simulator in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimated the potential of the landscape to provide harvest revenues, store carbon and maintain biodiversity across a 50-year time period. Then, we applied multiobjective optimization to identify the trade-offs between these three objectives and to identify the optimal combination of forest management regimes to achieve these objectives. It was not possible to achieve high levels of either carbon storage or biodiversity if the objective of forest management was to maximize timber harvest revenues. Moreover, conflicts between biodiversity and carbon storage became stronger when simultaneously targeting high levels of timber revenues. However, with small reductions in timber revenues, it was possible to greatly increase the multifunctionality of the landscape, especially the biodiversity indicators. Forest management actions, alternative to business-as-usual management, such as reducing thinnings, extending the rotation period and increasing the amount of area set aside from forestry may be necessary to safeguard biodiversity and non-timber ecosystem services in Fennoscandia.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that no forest management regime alone is able to maximize timber revenues, carbon storage and biodiversity individually or simultaneously and that a combination of different regimes is needed to resolve the conflicts among these objectives. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the trade-offs between different objectives by applying diversified forest management planning at the boreal landscape level and that we need to give up the all-encompassing objective of very intensive timber production, which is prevailing particularly in Fennoscandian countries.

AB  - Studies investigating congruent variations in species richness patterns in alpine habitats are scarce. We investigated the potential of using the indicator taxa approach for species richness in alpine habitats of the Scandes (Norway). In four areas, we investigated seven functional and taxonomic terrestrial groups of organisms and evaluated their contribution to the species diversity. The function of each group as a surrogate for the overall species diversity or for the diversity of another taxon was analysed. Three groups of invertebrates (spiders without Lycosids, Lycosids only, and ground beetles), three groups of plants (shrubs, graminoids, and herbs), and lichens were used for a cross-taxon analysis of species diversity. Congruence in species richness was restricted to several significant results, with vascular plants and spiders (Araneae) being best suited as surrogate taxa in alpine habitats of the Scandes. In the cross-taxon analyses they showed strongest significant positive correlations, covering the total species richness of the alpine habitats best. Species counts in one group account for up to 70% of the variation in total species richness. We found only limited evidence for an ideal, efficient biodiversity indicator taxon that could be applied without restrictions at different alpine habitats in low and middle alpine areas. Thus, our results suggest that it is very important to use more than one taxon as indicator for species richness in terrestrial alpine habitats. This should facilitate future conservation planning in alpine areas.

AB  - Methods have been proposed for identifying land use conflict potential using participatory mapping data and models. In a case study from Finland, we extend conflict mapping research by evaluating the capacity for participatory mapping to identify conflict for land uses that include mining, tourism development, commercial forestry, recreation, and nature protection. We evaluated two conflict models using reference sites where conflict was expected and assessed whether conflict potential was influenced by participant social group (resident, visitor, holiday home owner). The conflict models correctly identified the locations of current and proposed mining projects and major tourism locations (ski areas) in the region, while conflict for commercial forestry and reindeer herding was spatially distributed. Preferences for land use by social group were more similar than different across the study region. Identification of conflict potential using participatory mapping can provide a useful planning diagnostic but would benefit from additional research for validation.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services are undeniably important, yet are typically neglected in land management decisions due to a suite of intractable challenges: they are highly complex, localised, and inextricably associated with landscape features. However, to incorporate the ecosystem services framework into land management, decision-makers need the tools to disentangle the effects of land use from other factors. This is a major challenge for ecosystem services research. Forestry is a widespread land use that has considerable potential to deliver a broad range of ecosystem services, although this requires careful management planning. Additionally, modern production forestry is undergoing a period of rapid change in the face of a plethora of challenges, such as climate change and disease. To increase cultural ecosystem services delivery from forests, managers need tools to understand the implications of different management options. In this paper, we directly test how land use affects cultural ecosystem services. We use a new approach that recognises the underlying complexity of cultural ecosystem services but produces easily interpretable results that are locally relevant and directly applicable to land management. By combining participatory geographic information systems (GIS) and a novel site matching technique, we relate cultural values explicitly to land management, while accounting for the influence of landscape features. Applying this new method to a major UK forest site, we conducted a large survey to gather participatory GIS data points. We showed that land management significantly affected cultural ecosystem service values and were able to make a series of practical forest management recommendations. Notably, a greater diversity of tree species would improve cultural value, and open space is important within the forest landscape. This approach is highly flexible and can be applied to any type of landscape. It allows cultural ecosystem services to be fully integrated into land management decisions to formulate the best management strategy to maximise ecosystem service delivery.

AB  - Spatial prioritization could help target conservation actions directed to maintain both biodiversity and ecosystem services. We delineate hotspots and coldspots of two biodiversity conservation features and five regulating and cultural services by incorporating an indicator of 'threat', i.e. timber harvest profitability for forest areas in Telemark (Norway). We found hotspots, where high values of biodiversity, ecosystem services and threat coincide, ranging from 0.1 to 7.1% of the area, depending on varying threshold levels. Targeting of these areas for conservation follows reactive conservation approaches. In coldspots, high biodiversity and ecosystem service values coincide with low levels of threat, and cover 0.1-3.4% of the forest area. These areas might serve proactive conservation approaches at lower opportunity cost (foregone timber harvest profits). We conclude that a combination of indicators of biodiversity, ecosystem services and potential threat is an appropriate approach for spatial prioritization of proactive and reactive conservation strategies.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of human trampling on cover, diversity and species richness in an alpine heath ecosystem in northern Sweden. We tested the hypothesis that proximity to trails decreases plant cover, diversity and species richness of the canopy and the understory. We found a significant decrease in plant cover with proximity to the trail for the understory, but not for the canopy level, and significant decreases in the abundance of deciduous shrubs in the canopy layer and lichens in the understory. Proximity also had a significant negative impact on species richness of lichens. However, there were no significant changes in species richness, diversity or evenness of distribution in the canopy or understory with proximity to the trail. While not significant, liverworts, acrocarpous and pleurocarpous bryophytes tended to have contrasting abundance patterns with differing proximity to the trail, indicating that trampling may cause shifts in dominance hierarchies of different groups of bryophytes. Due to the decrease in understory cover, the abundance of litter, rock and soil increased with proximity to the trail. These results demonstrate that low-frequency human trampling in alpine heaths over long periods can have major negative impacts on lichen abundance and species richness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that trampling can decrease species richness of lichens. It emphasises the importance of including species-level data on non-vascular plants when conducting studies in alpine or tundra ecosystems, since they often make up the majority of species and play a significant role in ecosystem functioning and response in many of these extreme environments.

AB  - Forest harvesting of increasing intensities is expected to have intensifying impacts on the genetic diversity and population structure of postharvest naturally regenerated stands by affecting the magnitude of evolutionary processes, such as genetic drift, gene flow, mating system, and selection. We have tested this hypothesis for the first time by employing widely distributed boreal white spruce (Picea glauca) as a model and controlled, replicated experimental harvesting and regeneration experiment at the EMEND project site (http://www.emendproject.org). We used two approaches. First, genetic diversity and population structure of postharvest natural regeneration after five harvesting treatments (green tree retention of 75%, 50%, 20%, and 10%, and clearcut) were assessed and compared with those of the unharvested control (pristine preharvest old-growth) in two replicates each of conifer-dominated (CD) and mixed-wood (MW) forest, using 10 (six EST (expressed sequence tag) and four genomic) microsatellite markers. Second, genetic diversity and population structure of preharvest old-growth were compared with those of postharvest natural regeneration after five harvesting treatments in the same treatment blocks in one replicate each of CD and MW forests. Contrary to our expectations, genetic diversity, inbreeding levels, and population genetic structure were similar between unharvested control or preharvest old-growth and postharvest natural regeneration after five harvesting treatments, with clearcut showing no negative genetic impacts. The potential effects of genetic drift and inbreeding resulting from harvesting bottlenecks were counterbalanced by predominantly outcrossing mating system and high gene flow from the residual and/or surrounding white spruce. CD and MW forests responded similarly to harvesting of increasing intensities. Simulated data for 10, 50, and 100microsatellite markers showed the same results as obtained empirically from 10 microsatellite markers. Similar patterns of genetic diversity and population structure were observed for EST and genomic microsatellites. In conclusion, harvesting of increasing intensities did not show any significant negative impact on genetic diversity, population structure, and evolutionary potential of white spruce in CD and MW forests. Our first of its kind of study addresses the broad central forest management question how forest harvesting and regeneration practices can best maintain genetic biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.

AB  - Aim Habitat loss threatens plant diversity globally. Lack of plant functional connectivity between isolated populations is often pinpointed as one of the major underlying mechanisms driving subsequent species extinctions. Therefore, landscape-scale conservation management promoting functional connectivity needs to be implemented urgently. Supporting the movement of seed dispersal vectors such as grazing animals may help safeguard local and regional plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. However, the efficacy of such management remains to be thoroughly assessed. Location Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We test how grazing animals may serve as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks promoting plant functional connectivity via directed seed dispersal. Using landscape genetics, we compare isolated populations of the grassland perennial Campanula rotundifolia located in either active or abandoned grazing networks, to test if spatial patterns in their genetic diversity, differentiation and allele frequencies relate to the presence or absence of connectivity via rotational grazing management. Results Grazing networks imprinted strong landscape-scale spatial patterning in pairwise population genetic differentiation and within-population genetic diversity. Isolated C. rotundifolia populations functionally connected by grazing animals held higher genetic diversity compared to populations no longer connected by grazing livestock. Gene flow linked to the directed seed dispersal was higher between populations within grazing networks, confirmed by their increased allele richness. We found a predictable, nested loss of genetic diversity among C. rotundifolia populations in abandoned grazing networks. Main conclusions Grazing animals were important seed dispersal vectors, functionally connecting isolated grassland communities, so being vital to the successful long-term persistence and conservation of not only species but also genetic diversity. Crucially, the study underlines the possibilities of using domestic livestock as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks as an effective tool to manage, conserve and restore both genetic and species diversity among isolated plant communities in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Although carbon sequestration programs for non-industrial forestland owners in Massachusetts are being developed, very little is known about the program attributes of importance to different types of landowners or the likelihood that landowners will participate in any given program. This study estimates the probability that Massachusetts landowners will participate in several carbon offset programs using data from a survey of 3000 Massachusetts forestland owners. Results from an ordered logit discrete choice model suggest that the likelihood of enrollment in most programs is quite low. Landowners are clearly motivated by economic factors, but other aspects of carbon sequestration may also be important in their decision making.

AB  - Numerous studies have analyzed the carbon sequestration potential of forests and forest management. However, most studies either focused on national and supra-national scales or on the project level in the context of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. Few studies are available which analyze the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies on carbon sequestration, timber production and other forest services and functions at the operational level of the forest management unit (FMU). The present study investigates effects of three alternative management strategies for secondary Norway spruce forests (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (Norway spruce age class forestry; continuous cover forestry; conversion to mixed broadleaved forests) and an unmanaged control variant on C sequestration in situ, in wood products and through bioenergy production at the level of a private FMU in Austria, and analyses the interrelationships with timber production and key indicators of biodiversity. The hybrid patch model PICUS v 1.4 and a wood products model are employed to simulate forest ecosystem development, timber production, carbon storage in the forest and in wood product pools. Results show that in situ C sequestration is sensitive to forest management with the highest amount of carbon stored in the unmanaged strategy, followed by the continuous cover regime. All three management strategies store substantial quantities of C in the wood products pool. Considering alternative biomass utilization focused on bioenergy production, substantial C offsets could be generated from potential substitution of fossil fuels. Opportunity cost estimates for C sequestration reveal that C sequestration through forest management can be a cost efficient way to reduce atmospheric CO2, but the achievable quantities are limited due to biological limitations and societal constraints. The study emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable forest management strategies that serve the multiple demands on forests in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) typically co-occur in European forests, but show contrasting response to climate and environmental change. Sustainable forest management therefore depends on species- and regional-specific information. Here, we use tree-ring width measurements of 334 beech, 280 fir, 144 spruce and 63 pine trees from 75 inventory plots in Slovakia to assess the predominant factors that control radial stem growth of Europe's economically most important forest species. All four species exhibit significant shifts in stem growth over the past 100 years. Ring width patterns were, however, not significantly affected by tree species diversity and site elevation. The resistance, resilience and recovery of all species to the extreme summer droughts between 1950 and 2003 suggest that spruce is the species most unsuitable for the predicted warmer and drier future. Silver fir may benefit from warmer conditions, although we cannot conclude that it will not suffer from predicted increased frequency of climate extremes. Forest management in this locality should aim to avoid significant loss of forest cover by replacing Norway spruce monocultures with mixed stands of silver fir and European beech.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape elements, such as roadsides, hedgerows, field edges, and power line clearings, can be managed to provide important habitats for wild bees. However, the effects of habitat improvement schemes in power line clearings on components of diversity are poorly studied. We conducted a large-scale experiment to test the effects of different management practices on the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of wild bees in power line clearings (n=19 sites across southeastern Norway) and explored whether any treatment effects were modified by the environmental context. At each site, we conducted the following treatments: (1) Cut: all trees cut and left to decay in the clearing; (2) Cut+Remove: all trees cut and removed from the plot; and (3) Uncut: uncleared. The site-specific environmental context (i.e., elevation and floral diversity) influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity within bee species assemblages. The largest number of species was found in the Cut+Remove treatment in plots with a high forb species richness, indicating that the outcome of management practices depends on the environmental context. Clearing of treatment plots with many forb species also appeared to alter the phylogenetic composition of bee species assemblages, that is, more closely related species were found in the Cut and the Cut+Remove plots than in the Uncut plots. Synthesis and applications: Our experimental simulation of management practices in power line clearings influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of bee species assemblages. Frequent clearing and removal of the woody debris at low elevations with a high forb species richness can increase the value of power line clearings for solitary bees. It is therefore important for managers to consider the environmental context when designing habitat improvement schemes for solitary bees.

AB  - Forests are important contributors to the global carbon cycle and mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration and the supply of wood that substitutes for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive building materials. However, current climate policies only partially credit forest carbon sequestration and bioenergy policies are handled independently of forestry. Using Norway as a case study, we analyze two sets of simulated carbon tax/subsidy policies, one crediting forest carbon sequestration while maintaining predetermined harvest levels and utilization of wood, and another targeting GHG fluxes in the entire forest industrial sector allowing harvest levels and wood markets to change in response to the policy. Results indicate that GHG emission reduction potentials differ substantially between the two policies, being several times higher for the latter than the former policy at a given carbon price. This suggests that (i) previous research efforts in Europe have not captured the full mitigation potential as they have not included adaptations in the harvest level and the wood market and (ii) climate policies should target GHG fluxes in the entire sector to utilize its potential contribution for mitigating climate change.

AB  - Background: Forestry offers possibilities to sequestrate carbon in living biomass, deadwood and forest soil, as well as in products prepared of wood. In addition, the use of wood may reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. However, harvesting decreases the carbon stocks of forests and increases emissions from decomposing harvest residues.
   Methods: This study used simulation and optimization to maximize carbon sequestration in a boreal forest estate consisting of nearly 600 stands. A reference management plan maximized net present value and the other plans maximized the total carbon balance of a 100-, 200- or 300-year planning horizon, taking into account the carbon balances of living forest biomass, dead organic matter, and wood-based products
   Results: Maximizing carbon balance led to low cutting level with all three planning horizons. Depending on the time span, the carbon balance of these schedules was 2 to 3.5 times higher than in the plan that maximized net present value. It was not optimal to commence cuttings when the carbon pool of living biomass and dead organic matter stopped increasing after 150-200 years.
   Conclusions: Letting many mature trees to die was a better strategy than harvesting them when the aim was to maximize the long-term carbon balance of boreal Fennoscandian forest. The reason for this conclusion was that large dead trees are better carbon stores than harvested trees. To alter this outcome, a higher proportion of harvested trees should be used for products in which carbon is stored for long time.

AB  - Givaer is a small community, rich in cultural heritage, with buildings from the 17th century onward. Life in this community is based on fishing and husbandry traditions. In addition to threats from natural causes like storms and heavy seas, the built heritage is threatened by a lack of understanding for the necessity of zoning, as holiday homes are erected on the island. The Society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments (Fortidsminneforeningen) hopes to assist the islanders to continue living on Givaer. This paper points to the necessity of keeping the traditional daily life running, to help people continue to live away from more densely built-up areas. In this way the built heritage and the intangible heritage might be protected in the simplest way. The study will provide knowledge of use in supporting similar small scale communities in Norway.

AB  - Bottom-up estimates from long-term field experiments and modelling are the most commonly used approaches to estimate the carbon (C) sequestration potential of the agricultural sector. However, when data are required at European level, important margins of uncertainty still exist due to the representativeness of local data at large scale or different assumptions and information utilized for running models. In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t Cha(-1)yr(-1), while the opposite extreme scenario (100% of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28% of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101-336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100. Modelled carbon sequestration rates compared with values from an ad hoc meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of these estimates.

AB  - Forests of the Apennines are characterised by high canopy cover and high tree species diversity (being at the interface between two major climatic zones of Europe), and provide important ecosystem functions to millions of people. They exemplify cutting-edge themes such as forest ecology in warmer climates, consequences of heavy land use, and resilience at the trailing edge of the distribution of many European forest species (Silver fir, Norway spruce, Beech, Black pine, Birch).
   We introduce the setting under the geological and climatological point of view and review the literature on the interactions between these long-term drivers and the specific, structural, and genetic diversity of these forest communities (e.g., effects of glacial refugia or tectonic/volcanic activity), followed by a brief outline of what little is known about natural disturbance regimes and their range of variability. Anthropogenic disturbances (fire, grazing) and land use changes (abandonment of cropland and pasture) have been by far the main drivers of forest dynamics at least for the last two millennia, determining for examples overageing of coppices, treeline advances, forest encroachment on former agricultural land.
   We suggest considerations about the interplay between these land use changes and disturbance drivers (e.g. fuel continuity), summarize comparisons between managed and unmanaged forests (e.g., increase in tree size, deadwood, biodiversity indicators), and elaborate on current proposals for climate-adapted management, highlighting specific and genetic diversity as an important source of resilience and adaptive potential.

AB  - A futuristic study by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency in the 1990s on how to make Swedish agriculture environmentally and economically sustainable by 2021 has been updated. The updating was based on assumptions of far-reaching improvements in biological productivity and the replacement of all existing EU support with environmental payments based on landscape values and the climate utility of carbon sequestration. The results suggest that economically sustainable food production satisfying domestic demand can be achieved through large-scale labour-and capital-saving rationalization and compensation for additional costs arising from special Swedish animal welfare regulations. Such rationalization is also necessary for the economically sustainable preservation of landscape values, including grazed semi-natural pastures and remaining arable land in forest-dominated districts. Carbon sequestration by broad-leaved trees planted on pastures and on arable land not needed for food production could compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions from food production.

AB  - The number of spider species found in faunas north of 60 degreesN varies from 250 (Polar Urals) to 620 (Finland). Faunal lists allow for comparison of the most interesting and important areas of species diversity. Only two areas, divided by the Beringian Strait, namely northeast Siberia and northwest North America have marked proportions of endemic spider taxa. There are still some areas in Eurasia which can be regarded as unstudied "white spots". Investigations are especially required in west Siberia, northwest Yakutia and in northern parts of the Verkhoyanski and Cherski Mountain ranges. High levels of endemism, together with rather high species diversities in NE Siberia (550 spider species) and NW Nearctic (about 500 species) in spite of inadequate levels of investigation show a high necessity of further studies and conservation, at least in NE Siberia.

AB  - In boreal coniferous forests, artificial edges often modify the habitat, increasing the likelihood that the diversity and composition of species changes. This study examined the assemblage of polypores and polypore-associated beetles at the edge of mature managed spruce-dominated forests and clear-cuts. The highest number of polypore occurrences and the greatest diversity of polypore species occurred at the clear-cut. In south-facing edges polypores occurred closer to the edge both in clear-cut and in forest than in the north-facing edges. The number of polypore-associated beetle individuals was greatest in the clear-cut, but there was no effect of edge on species richness of beetles. Orientation of the edge had no effect on the distribution of beetles in clear-cut, but in the forest beetles were closer to the edge in south-facing edges than in north-facing edges. The higher density of individuals and greater diversity of species in clear-cut may result from the rapid, short-term increase in dead-wood resource.

AB  - This paper investigates how land-use management practices incorporate nature conservation concerns in four Norwegian rural municipalities. It focuses on nature conservation, which is vital both to maintain nature's ability to store carbon and to preserve ecosystems, as key aspects of the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The paper analyses the perceptions of local, regional and state stakeholders relating to four rural municipalities following diverging land-use trajectories. We find land policy in all four cases to be highly entangled with strategies to achieve growth in terms of income, job creation and population. When nature conservation was not in line with wider economic or social considerations, it was less integrated into land-policy practices. In three of the municipalities, the construction of residential units, holiday-homes or renewable energy parks was prioritized over the preservation of nature areas or cultural landscapes. One case presented a contrasting trajectory, as it involved a clear alignment between nature conservation and economic growth. Here, conservation was considered a key strategy to both sustain the traditional fishery industry and to accommodate the growing tourism. However, while this municipality's restrictive land use was based on a nature conservation understanding, it was also connected to the greenhouse-gas emissions, resource exhaustion and waste generation traditionally associated with international tourism. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of rural municipalities being equipped with sufficient resources if they are to prioritize environmental concerns over the economic and social dimensions of sustainability in their land-use management practices.

AB  - In many Protected Areas of Eastern Europe and Siberia, the European spruce (Picea abies) or Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) plays a significant role in plant communities. Difficulties in determining the specific and intraspecific diversity of spruce in Protected Areas occur in the zone of natural (introgressive) hybridisation of spruce. Since the time of Ledebour's studies, the main diagnostic feature of these spruce species is the shape of the upper part of seed (cone) scales. The European spruce has an angularly acuminate and noticeably elongated cone scale, while the cone scale of the Siberian spruce has a close to rounded form and it is less elongated. In East-European spruce populations, formed under introgression influence, this trait has an intermediate character. The shape of the upper part of spruce seed scales remains constant throughout the whole tree life. And it is characterised by a high variability within populations and between different populations. Nowadays, the study of the phenotypic diversity of the spruce populations is performed using visual descriptive assessment. i.e. subjectively. Consequently, disparate results are often obtained even for the same study areas. The applying of metric assessment of a trait and the consequent distinguishing of the phenotypes of individuals allow to perform mathematical processing of the results and to obtain objective data about the population structure. We aimed to study the phenotypic diversity of spruce in Protected Areas in Eastern Europe and Siberia on the basis of metric assessment primarily of the shape of seed scales. The determination of the coefficient of narrowing (C-n) and coefficient of projection (C-p) of the upper part of seed scale can be considered as the most objective method to study this diagnostic trait. The difference between these coefficients (C-n-C-p) is a more informative indicator to characterise properties of individuals, populations and their groups.
   In Eastern Europe and Siberia, we distinguished nine areas of distribution of different population groups (or phenotypes): P.e., P.ecm., P.em., P.emm., P.m., P.mms., P.ms., P.mss., P.s. They are characterised by an average value of the C-n-C-p indicator: -50%, -40%, -30%, -20%, -10%, 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively. On the basis of this gradation in populations, we adopted a similar gradation of individuals' phenotypes: e, eem, em, emm, m, mms, ms, mss, s. On the basis of study of the spruce population diversity in Protected Areas in Eastern Europe and Siberia, considering phenotypes identified by the metric traits of seed scales, we found that all of them significantly differed in terms of all analysed traits. In the National Park "Belovezhskaya Pushcha", Carpathian Biosphere Reserve, Central Forest State Natural Biosphere Reserve, and Oksky State Natural Biosphere Reserve (European range of spruce), we found the highest cone length, highest phenotype frequency of European spruce individuals (60-100%). In these Protected Areas, there are no or very few intermediate phenotypes, and no Siberian spruce phenotypes. The Lapland State Natural Biosphere Reserve, Visimskiy State Natural Biosphere Reserve, Yuganskiy State Nature Reserve, Sokhondinskiy State Natural Biosphere Reserve, and Vitimskiy State Nature Reserve formed the opposite group according to all indicators studied. These Protected Areas are located within the range of the Siberian spruce. They are c tensed by predomination (63-100%) of phenotypes of Siberian spruce individuals, while there are no European spruce phenotypes. We established the predominance of intermediate spruce phenotypes in the State Nature Reserve "Kologrivskiy Leso", National Park "Chavash Varmane", Volzhsko-Kamskiy State Nature Biosphere Reserve, and Pinega State Nature Reserve. Of them, the first two Protected Areas are a bit closer to European spruce phenotypes, while the second two Protected Areas are characterised by similarity to the Siberian spruce phenotypes. The objective, sufficiently tested method to study the spruce population phenotypic diversity can also be used mother Protected Areas.

AB  - Cultivation of non-native tree species is a promising option to adapt managed forests to climate change. However, consequences of non-native tree species on flora, fauna, and microorganisms that occur in forest ecosystems (forest associates) need to be considered when managing forests. We lack a solid understanding of how cultivating non-native tree species in pure stands and in mixture with native tree species impacts abundance and species diversity of forest associates. We compared abundance, alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity of eight forest-floor-associated taxa that are relevant for ecosystem functioning (including fungi, plants, arthropods, and small mammals) between different forest ecosystems. We addressed pure stands of non-native coniferous Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and two native species, broad-leaved European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and coniferous Norway spruce (Picea abies), as well as mixed stands of European beech with each conifer in two regions with differing site conditions in temperate Northwest Germany. Diversity indices revealed differences among species groups. Gamma-diversity and alpha-diversity of forest associates in Douglas-fir and spruce stands were usually higher than in beech stands. Estimates of species diversity of mixed stands are intermediate between estimates for the respective pure stands. Differences in the diversity between the two study regions were highly taxon specific with no clear support for a general trend toward a higher or lower species diversity of forest associates depending on site quality. Abundance values show a pattern similar to our diversity estimates, but with a higher statistical uncertainty. Non-native Douglas-fir stands provided habitats to support associated species communities of equally high or higher diversity than stands of native beech or spruce. Mixed stands of non-native and native tree species may be a management option to achieve different goals, that is, to provide habitats for species that are strictly associated with beech and to increase resilience to climate change. However, the overall diversity of forest-floor-associated biota is not improved by cultivating Douglas-fir or spruce in mixture with beech.

AB  - We study the economics of carbon storage using a model that includes forest size structure and determines the choice between rotation forestry and continuous cover forestry. Optimal harvests may rely solely on thinning, implying infinite rotation and continuous cover forestry, or both thinning and clearcuts, implying finite rotation periods. Given several carbon prices and interest rates, we optimize the timing and intensity of thinnings along with the choice of management regime. In addition to the carbon storage in living trees, we include the carbon dynamics of dead trees and timber products. Forest growth is specified by an empirically validated transition matrix model for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form by applying bilevel optimization with gradient-based interior point methods and a genetic algorithm. Carbon pricing postpones thinnings, increases stand density by directing harvests to larger trees, and typically yields a regime shift from rotation forestry to continuous cover forestry. In continuous cover solutions, the steady-state harvesting interval and the diameter distribution of standing and harvested trees are sensitive to carbon price, implying that carbon pricing increases the sawlog ratio of timber yields. Additionally, we obtain relatively inexpensive stand-level marginal costs of carbon storage.

AB  - Forest management methods and harvest intensities influence wood production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. We devised different management scenarios by means of stakeholder analysis and incorporated them in the forest growth simulator PREBAS. To analyse impacts of harvest intensity, we used constraints on total harvest: business as usual, low harvest, intensive harvest and no harvest. We carried out simulations on a wall-to-wall grid in Finland until 2050. Our objectives were to (1) test how the management scenarios differed in their projections, (2) analyse the potential wood production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity under the different harvest levels, and (3) compare different options of allocating the scenarios and protected areas. Harvest level was key to carbon stocks and fluxes regardless of management actions and moderate changes in proportion of strictly protected forest. In contrast, biodiversity was more dependent on other management variables than harvesting levels, and relatively independent of carbon stocks and fluxes.

AB  - Bryophyte flora and community structure were studied in 8 streams around Lake Lohjanjarvi in southern Finland. Floristic composition, cover, frequency, and microhabitat parameters were measured, including type of substrate, moisture, slope and aspect in stream. Aspect was used for description of zonation pattern. The Brillouin diversity equation and Sorensen's quotient of similarity were used for the evaluation of community structure. The communities included 33 mosses and 5 hepatics. One third of the species were truly aquatic and the rest were terrestrial species occasionally occurring in a stream habitat. Most species occurred at low frequencies. Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. was most frequent and adundant, and Brachythecium plumosum (Hedw.) B.S.G., Hygroamblystegium fluviatile (Hedw.) Loeske, Racornitrium aciculare (Hedw.) Brid., and Scapania undulata (L.) Dum, were rather common. Communities differed from each other in floristic composition, species number, diversity, and relative abundance of species. The highest diversity was in the stream with a rather high species number and the most even relative abundance of species.

AB  - Norwegian protected areas have historically been managed by central, expertise bureaucracy; however, a governance change in 2010 decentralized and delegated the right to manage protected areas to locally elected politicians and elected S mi representatives in newly established National Park Boards. We explore how this new governance change affects adaptive capacity within the reindeer industry, as the reindeer herders are now participating with other users in decision- making processes related to large tracts of protected areas in which they have pasture access. Aspects within adaptive capacity and resilience thinking are useful as complementary dimensions to a social- ecological system framework (Ostrom 2007) in exploring the dynamics of complex adaptive social- ecological systems. The National Park Board provides a novel example of adaptive governance that can foster resilient livelihoods for various groups of actors that depend on protected areas. Data for this paper were gathered primarily through observation in National Park Board meetings, focus groups, and qualitative interviews with reindeer herders and other key stakeholders. We have identified certain aspects of the national park governance that may serve as sources of resilience and adaptive capacity for the natural system and pastoral people that rely on using these areas. The regional National Park Board is as such a critical mechanism that provides an action arena for participation and conflict resolution. However, desired outcomes such as coproduction of knowledge, social learning, and increased adaptive capacity within reindeer husbandry have not been actualized at this time. The challenge with limited scope of action in the National Park Board and a mismatch between what is important for the herders and what is addressed in the National Park Board become important for the success of this management model.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to describe the relative importance of hay meadows and other types of semi-natural grasslands for species diversity and to focus on the impact of the fragmentation of hay meadows on species diversity. The study area was the rural districts of Hjartdal and Seljord in the county of Telemark, southern Norway. Interrelationships between the landscape and vegetation were revealed by combining research at three hierarchical levels, i.e. the landscape, biotope and species levels. A descriptive and analytical technique based on CIR aerial photo interpretation was developed for the landscape mesoscale. The historical background of the landscape and former biotope patterns were described, since traditional and sustained management is an important parameter in the landscape ecological analysis. The vegetation of different grassland biotopes was classified and numerically analysed. The results of the aerial photo interpretation revealed a landscape with considerable complexity and high biodiversity both at landscape level and at biotope and species level, due to the many traditional hay meadows and pastures still left in this area. The results also showed that the remaining fragments of traditional hay meadows are of vital importance for biological diversity. They had the highest average number of species per subplot and furthermore contained species that did not occur in any other grassland biotopes. In addition, the largest populations of several grassland species were found in the traditionally managed hay meadows. Unfertilised pastures and verges along small roads were also species-rich but were not in this connection substitutes for the hay meadows, nor were the `modern' hay meadows or the verges along the main roads. The spatial distribution and configuration of the biotopes and the abundance of meadow plant species within the study area suggest that in order to maintain species diversity it may be important to preserve and manage all the remaining fragments of traditional hay meadows. The surrounding environment, the matrix, should also be managed appropriately.

AB  - The nitrogen fertilization of boreal forests is investigated in terms of microeconomics as a tool for carbon sequestration. The effects of nitrogen fertilization's timing on the return rate on capital and the expected value of the timber stock are investigated within a set of semi-fertile, spruce-dominated boreal stands using an inventory-based growth model. Early fertilization tends to shorten rotations, reducing timber stock and carbon storage. The same applies to fertilization after the second thinning. Fertilization applied ten years before stand maturity is profitable and increases the timber stock, but the latter effect is small. The fertilization of mature stands, extending any rotation by ten years, effectively increases the carbon stock. Profitability varies but is increased by fertilization instead of merely extending the rotation.

AB  - In boreal commercial forests, carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, and biodiversity conservation can be promoted through various measures. This study examines the factors affecting non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners' preferences for such forest management practices. A systematic literature review serves as a reference for the empirical analysis of a survey data on the Finnish NIPF owners' stated willingness to adopt thirteen distinct forest management practices. Binary logit models reveal socio-demographic factors, site-specific characteristics, previous forest management, and motivations for forest ownership that are associated with the stated adoption of management practices. Especially, environmental and financial motivations play an important role in decisions concerning forest management practices. Statistically significant factors vary depending on the forest management practice, reflecting the NIPF owner heterogeneity. Younger and highly educated forest owners are more supportive for various management practices that promote biodiversity, while older forest owners are reluctant towards deadwood retention. The results underline the importance of accounting for heterogeneous preferences regarding forest management practices when designing and implementing policies and advisory services aiming at enhancing carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, or biodiversity in boreal commercial forests.

AB  - The non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is widely distributed in Europe and promoted by forestry due to its assumed resistance against climate change. An increasing cultivation area is, however, viewed critically by nature conservation as negative effects on native biodiversity and naturalness are expected. We investigated plant species diversity and composition in two strict forest reserves (SFR) dominated by Douglas fir in southwest Germany. These reserves were established in the years 2001/2002 to study the development of Douglas fir forests after management abandonment. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 2005 and repeated in 2017. We used re-survey data from a nearby SFR dominated by native tree species as a reference. The understory vegetation showed consistent development after management abandonment, irrespective of tree species identity and origin. It became less diverse and more shade-tolerant over time due to missing soil disturbance and decreasing light availability. In contrast to a native canopy, though, Douglas fir promoted the share of generalist species. Regeneration of Douglas fir largely decreased in the SFRs underlining its competitive weakness against native tree species, mainly against European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Thereby, regeneration patterns of Douglas fir in the SFR were similar to those observed in the native range.

AB  - Academics have frequently used and endorsed the Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) approach for national park management. However, it is only minimally used by public agencies such as national park organisations. This study explores the potential that managers of Finnish national parks see in the PPGIS approach in the context of planning for the visitor use of parks. Ten semi-structured interviews with managers of Parks and Wildlife Finland were conducted. The managers perceived that PPGIS could help in optimising site management, and preferred PPGIS studies that are practical and clearly connected to planning site management actions. They envisioned a mobile phone application that would allow mapping visitor experiences on the spot. Overall, the managers were open to adopting place-based planning practices. The study increases the understanding of public agencies' views towards PPGIS. It also produces practical information for conducting PPGIS case studies as well as for integrating PPGIS tools into planning processes.

AB  - Conserving biodiversity is regarded one of the major issues for enabling sustainable use of natural resources. This paper, focusing on the Baltic Sea and Sweden's fisheries, emphasizes the value of preserving biodiversity for the maintenance of diverse, resilient and functioning ecological life-support systems. These constitute a fundamental and necessary base for all human activities. The major features of diversity: species diversity, genetic diversity, functional diversity and spatial and temporal diversity and diversity changes in the Baltic Sea ecosystem are described and discussed together with the development of management approaches in Sweden's fisheries. The paper takes a systems perspective, focusing on the linkages between ecological and economic systems. Biodiversity is seen as an interdependent part of a cluster of diversities in the human society and in the ecological system. The need for broader integrated approaches enhancing diversity in resource-management systems are emphasized.

AB  - Research Highlights: A large body of research highlighted the important contributions that urban forests make to cities and their inhabitants. However, our urban forests face threats from issues such as rapid urbanization, climate change, and the spread of pests and diseases. As such, proactive and effective management is necessary to ensure their long-term sustainability. Given the multiple spatial and temporal scales on which threats can arise, effective management needs to account for these scales and adjust accordingly. The degree to which this currently happens is unclear. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the role of multi-scale management in urban forestry, using cemeteries in Malmo, Sweden as a case study. Cemeteries can provide extensive tree canopy but are not readily considered in urban forest management. We sought to determine (1) the threats to the current cemetery tree populations, (2) the extent of multi-scale cemetery tree management, (3) whether tree management plans promote multi-scale management, and (4) how cemetery tree management can be improved. Materials and Methods: Malmo cemetery tree inventories were analyzed with respect to size class and species diversity. Existing cemetery tree management plans were examined to determine the spatial and temporal scales of their recommendations. Interviews were conducted with cemetery managers to determine management priorities and actions. Results: We found that cemetery tree populations in Malmo suffer from a lack of age class and species diversity. Management tends to occur on short time scales and efforts focus mainly on addressing individual trees, although some consideration is given to large-scale species diversification. The management plans previously created for these cemetery trees make recommendations for age class and species diversification but are yet to be used extensively by cemetery managers. Conclusions: The long-term stability of Malmo's cemetery tree populations is threatened by a lack of species and age diversity. Current management efforts emphasize addressing small-scale issues. Although there is a desire to improve species diversity, this can cause conflict with existing cultural values.

AB  - Retention of forested buffers around streams following forest cutting operations is a common management technique used to protect aquatic resources and conserve the surrounding ecosystem services. Species richness, or alpha-diversity, is commonly used as an indicator of the effects of forestry management although it provides very little information about those effects on ecosystem processes and function. Functional diversity links species traits and ecosystem function incorporating species diversity, community composition, and functional guild and is more suitable to investigate the direct and indirect effects of forestry on ecosystem function. We sampled spiders and vascular plants in buffered and unbuffered stream-forest systems in southern Sweden and used a trait-based approach to assess the effects of buffer size and environmental variables on functional diversity. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the effects of buffer size and condition on spider and vascular plant diversity. We found no effect of buffer size on the functional richness or functional redundancy for spiders or vascular plants. Buffer size had a slight effect on the alpha-diversity of spiders within small buffers and fully forested sites but the effect was small. Other buffer variables including canopy closure, buffer density, bare ground coverage, and soil fertility had direct effects on spider and vascular plant functional diversity. The main driver of functional richness was alpha-diversity, but our SEM analysis illustrated other environmental variables working jointly to drive functional diversity. Using a trait-based approach, we showed that forested buffers have a minimal overall impact on spider and vascular plant functional diversity. However, it is important to maintain high levels of alpha-diversity to preserve and promote both spider and plant functional richness in production forests and we suggest that forest management conserves and encourages high levels of alpha-diversity to increase overall functional diversity.

AB  - The Kyoto Protocol allows the use of domestic forest carbon sequestration to offset emissions to a limited degree, while bioenergy as an unlimited emission reduction option receives substantial financial support in many countries.
   The primary objective of this study was to analyze (1) whether these limits on forest carbon sequestration would be binding, thereby leading to inefficient mitigation, and (2) the total potential effect of the protocol on the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in the forest sector.
   A partial equilibrium model of the Norwegian forest sector was used to quantify the GHG fluxes in a base scenario with no climate policy, a Kyoto Protocol policy (KP policy), and a policy with no cap on forest carbon sequestration (FC policy), assuming that the policies apply the rest of the century.
   Carbon offsets are higher under the KP policy than in the base scenario and likewise higher than under the FC policy in the short run, but the KP policy fails to utilize the forest carbon sequestration potential in the long run as it provides considerably less incentives to invest in forestry than the FC policy.
   The KP increases the Norwegian forest sector's climate change mitigation compared to no climate policy but less in the long run than a carbon policy with no cap on forest carbon credits.

AB  - Background Although a standard taxonomy of organisms has existed for nearly 300 years, no consensus has yet been reached on principles for systematization of ecological diversity (i.e., the co-ordinated variation of abiotic and biotic components of natural diversity). In a rapidly changing world, where nature is under constant pressure, standardized terms and methods for characterization of ecological diversity are urgently needed (e.g., to enhance precision and credibility of global change assessments). Aim The aim is to present the EcoSyst framework, a set of general principles and methods for systematization of natural diversity that simultaneously addresses biotic and abiotic variation, and to discuss perspectives opened by this framework. Innovation EcoSyst provides a framework for systematizing natural variation in a consistent manner across different levels of organization. At each ecodiversity level, EcoSyst principles can be used to establish: (a) an extensive attribute system with descriptive variables that cover all relevant sources of variation; (b) a hierarchical-type system; and (c) a set of guidelines for land-cover mapping that is consistent across spatial scales. EcoSyst type systems can be conceptualized as multidimensional models, by which a key characteristic (the response) is related to variation in one or more key sources of variation (predictors). EcoSyst type hierarchies are developed by a gradient-based iterative procedure, by which the "ecodiversity distance" (i.e., the extent to which the key characteristic differs between adjacent candidate types) is standardized and the ecological processes behind observed patterns are explicitly taken into account. Application We present "Nature in Norway" (NiN), an implementation of the EcoSyst framework for Norway for the ecosystem and landscape levels of ecodiversity. Examples of applications to research and management are given. Conclusion The EcoSyst framework provides a theoretical platform, principles and methods that can complement and enhance initiatives towards a global-scale systematics of ecodiversity.

AB  - The seas along the western European margin encompass a vast geographical area comprising numerous different habitats, and are home to more than 10,000 metazoan species. Although research in this extensive region has been undertaken since the early 1800s, many new species are being described and distributional patterns identified. Recent studies incorporating the most extensive data series ever used in such European studies have failed to find any relationship between latitude and infaunal shelf biodiversity. Along the European shelf, species richness generally increases to a depth of 200 m and then decreases from 300-500 m. In the deep Northeast Atlantic, a unimodal curve illustrates how macrofaunal species diversity changes with depth whilst the megafauna appear to have a bimodal distribution. Regional studies are equivocal in that poleward increases in species diversity have been observed in some studies or taxa, but not in others. In the North Sea, arguably the best studied system in European waters, there appears to be a distinct increase in diversity with increasing latitude. Since this trend is confounded by similar latitudinal gradients in depth and trawling intensity, there is no clear explanation for the biodiversity pattern. Climatic shifts in diversity patterns and species ranges have recently been observed. Here we report previously unpublished data on changes in species richness that have been observed along the Norwegian coast over the past two decades, with the most northerly region seeing more than a 15% increase in the number of species being discovered there. This review synthesizes published and new biodiversity data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, and from the coast to the deep-sea, to provide an overview of what is known along the western European margin. Threats to the biodiversity of the region are highlighted, as well as identifying where there are still gaps in our knowledge.

AB  - Expanding high-elevation and high-latitude forest has contrasting climate feedbacks through carbon sequestration (cooling) and reduced surface reflectance (warming), which are yet poorly quantified. Here, we present an empirically based projection of mountain birch forest expansion in south-central Norway under climate change and absence of land use. Climate effects of carbon sequestration and albedo change are compared using four emission metrics. Forest expansion was modeled for a projected 2.6 degrees C increase in summer temperature in 2100, with associated reduced snow cover. We find that the current (year 2000) forest line of the region is circa 100 m lower than its climatic potential due to land-use history. In the future scenarios, forest cover increased from 12% to 27% between 2000 and 2100, resulting in a 59% increase in biomass carbon storage and an albedo change from 0.46 to 0.30. Forest expansion in 2100 was behind its climatic potential, forest migration rates being the primary limiting factor. In 2100, the warming caused by lower albedo from expanding forest was 10 to 17 times stronger than the cooling effect from carbon sequestration for all emission metrics considered. Reduced snow cover further exacerbated the net warming feedback. The warming effect is considerably stronger than previously reported for boreal forest cover, because of the typically low biomass density in mountain forests and the large changes in albedo of snow-covered tundra areas. The positive climate feedback of high-latitude and high-elevation expanding forests with seasonal snow cover exceeds those of afforestation at lower elevation, and calls for further attention of both modelers and empiricists. The inclusion and upscaling of these climate feedbacks from mountain forests into global models is warranted to assess the potential global impacts.

AB  - Drainage to increase timber production is a major cause of degradation of boreal peatlands in Europe. As a consequence of the forestry drainage, the area of pristine spruce swamp forests has declined drastically in northern Europe over the past century. In restoration by rewetting, drainage ditches are blocked to restore the pre-disturbance hydrological regime and, ultimately, the biodiversity values and ecosystem functions of pristine spruce swamp forests. In this study, we quantify vegetation recovery and examine mechanisms behind the changes in plant community composition. For this, we surveyed the understorey vegetation of 9 undrained, 9 drained and 18 rewetted spruce swamp forest sites in southern Finland. The vegetation survey was accompanied by water table (WT) position and tree stand measurements. Sphagnum cover decreased after drainage and increased after rewetting. Drainage increased the cover of the unvegetated ground surface, while the cover of moss species other than Sphagnum and feather mosses was highest in the rewetted group. A constrained ordination analysis shows that following rewetting, species composition had developed towards the undrained reference state. Regarding their plant community composition, the rewetted sites were situated in the middle of the undrained-drained axis, differing significantly from both the undrained and the drained sites. Similarity to the undrained reference state depended on current WT and was driven by the Sphagnum mosses. Among the rewetted sites, which varied in their rewetting age from 1 to 14 years, similarity to undrained was not dependent on time since rewetting. The most important predictors for the between-site variation in plant community composition were the division between the undrained and the other (drained or rewetted) sites, WT position and birch volume. Species diversity was lower in the undrained than in the drained and rewetted sites, mainly due to lower species evenness. It appears that the competitive superiority of the Sphagnum mosses in wet conditions results in a lower species diversity in the undrained reference state. The less optimal conditions for Sphagna that result from drainage enable higher diversity by opening space for other species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We study forestry in the Sami people homeland to understand an ongoing conflict between conventional forestry and maintaining forests as reindeer pastures vital for indigenous Sami livelihood. Conventional logging affects pastures by creating stand densities suboptimal to lichen growth and by decreasing old-growth forest areas, both of which are essential to reindeer survivability during the subarctic winter. Our model includes timber production, carbon sequestration, externalities on reindeer husbandry, and optimization between rotation forestry and forestry with continuous forest cover. We show that the profitability of conventional forestry relies on utilizing existing forests, an outcome we label as forest capital mining. By varying the carbon price between (sic)0 and (sic)60 per tCO(2) and assuming a 3% interest rate, we show that continuous cover forestry, which better preserves pastures, is always optimal. A carbon price of (sic)60 - (sic)100 chokes off timber production. Given the present management practices and an old-growth forest as the initial state, the carbon choke price decreases to (sic)14-(sic)20. Our economic analysis on maintaining old-growth forest versus conversion to timber production is an alternative to the frequently applied approach based on carbon debts and carbon payback periods.

AB  - Plant communities of set-aside agricultural land in a European project were managed in order to enhance plant succession towards weed-resistant, mid-successional grassland. Here, we ask if the management of a plant community affects the earthworm community. Field experiments were established in four countries, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and the Czech Republic. High (15 plant species) and low diversity (four plant species) seed mixtures were sown as management practice, with natural colonization as control treatment in a randomized block design. The response of the earthworrns to the management was studied after three summers since establishment of the sites. Samples were also taken from plots with continued agricultural practices included in the experimental design and from a site with a late successional plant community representing the target plant community. The numbers and biomass of individuals were higher in the set-aside plots than in the agricultural treatment in two countries out of four. The numbers of individuals at one site (The Netherlands) was higher in the naturally colonized plots than in the sowing treatments, otherwise there were no differences between the treatments. Species diversity was lower in the agricultural plots in one country. The species composition had changed from the initial community of the agricultural field, but was still different from a late successional target community. The worm biomass was positively related to legume biomass in Sweden and to grass biomass in the UK. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agri-environmental schemes are often targeted at heterogenic landscapes to support several ecosystem services besides food production. The question is whether heterogenic landscapes also support recreation values. Previous studies suggest this but statistical analysis of the relation between heterogeneity and recreation is lacking. To assess this, we used a quantitative Landscape Heterogeneity Index (LHI), developed for biodiversity conservation. We asked five different user groups to score 12 photographs of landscapes depicting different LHI. All user groups, especially conservationists and hunters, preferred the heterogeneous landscapes and this difference was statistically significant for all groups except farmers. Accessibility, in terms of roads, had no obvious impact on the recreational value conveyed by the photos. The paper provides evidence that the recreational value amplifies biodiversity-based values of heterogeneous landscapes and argues that such landscapes also provide resilience and insurance value buffering against unexpected risks. Implications for policy are discussed.
   HIGHLIGHTS Recreational value was positively correlated to landscape heterogeneity.
   This correlation was statistically significant for all user groups except farmers.
   Accessibility, in terms of roads, had no obvious impact on the recreational value.
   The multi-functionality of heterogeneous agricultural landscapes including resilience and the insurance value should be better acknowledged in policy.

In the current study, we used historical crop data records to quantify how crop species diversity is related to pedo-climatic conditions, and how crop diversity developed over time at the national and regional scale in Sweden between 1965 and 2019. Crop diversity was quantified using the exponent of the Shannon index. We found spatial differences across the country, with a significant increase in crop diversity from the north to the south, showing that there is a strong natural control of latitude and associated mean annual temperature on crop diversity in Sweden. Mean annual precipitation and soil texture had no significant relationship with crop diversity across Sweden. At the national level, crop diversity had no significant change over time. At the county level, our analyses revealed different temporal trends between counties. Crop diversity increased over time in certain counties, while in others no change or a decrease occurred. The temporal changes could not be explained by climate trends, and were likely influenced by socioeconomic factors. However, more than half of the counties showed an increase in crop diversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase crop diversity in Sweden. Our study shows that both natural and socioeconomic factors need to be considered to achieve an increase in crop diversity in the future.

AB  - Questions
   How does long-term increase in nutrient availability affect species composition, species diversity and functional composition in boreal rich fens, and how does this differ from short-term effects? What are the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes, and how does nutrient limitation influence species diversity in these communities?
   LocationMethodsSOlendet Nature Reserve, central Norway.
   A full-factorial field experiment. Plots in two localities received one of following treatments (n=3): no nutrient addition (control), N, P, K, NP, NK, PK and NPK addition. Cover of plant species was recorded before treatment, and after two and 15years of treatment.
   ResultsConclusionsTwo years of nutrient addition caused small changes in species composition, but addition of NP led to large increase in abundance of species with high ability to exploit the added nutrientsa direct result of the elimination of nutrient limitation in the communities. After 15years of nutrient addition there were significant changes following three different pathways, one for each of N, P and NP addition. The addition of NP led to large community shifts, considerable species turnover and reduced species and functional richness, mainly caused by increase in cover of highly competitive and tussock-forming grasses like Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca ovina and Molinia caerulea, out-competing other species, especially bryophytes. Addition of N led to smaller changes in species turnover, and without clear dominant species. Addition of P led to considerable species turnover, but no reduction in species or functional richness, and the bryophyte diversity increased. This is explained by the bryophytes' association with N-fixing cyanobacteria, suggesting less N limitation and a greater ability to utilize the added P when vascular plants suffer from N shortage. In addition, bryophytes are more sensitive to low P availability, due to larger P requirements compared to vascular plants. There was no effect of K addition.
   Both N and P limitation is essential for the maintenance of high species diversity in boreal rich fens, and P limitation controls bryophyte diversity. From a management perspective, N and P limitation is vital in the conservation of boreal rich fens or when a functional fen system is reestablished through restoration measures.

AB  - Question: Can satellite data be related to fine-scale species diversity and does the integrated use of field and satellite data provide information that can be used in the estimation of fine-scale species diversity in semi-natural grassland sites?
   Location: The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden).
   Methods: Field work including the on-site description of 62 semi-natural grassland sites (represented by three 0.5 m x 0.5 m plots per site) was performed to record response variables (total species richness, mean species richness and species spatial turnover) and field-measured explanatory variables (field-layer height and distance between plots). Within each site, QuickBird satellite data were extracted from a standardized sample area by associating each field plot with a 3 x 3 pixel window (1 pixel = 2.4 m x 2.4 m). Explanatory variables (the normalized difference vegetation index and spectral heterogeneity) were generated from the satellite data. Correlation tests, univariate regressions, variance partitioning and multivariate linear regressions were used to analyse the associations between response and explanatory variables.
   Results: There was a significant association between the spectral heterogeneity of the near-infrared band and the field-measured spatial turnover of species. The most parsimonious explanatory model for each response variable included both field-measured and satellite-generated explanatory variables. The models explained 30-35% of the variation in species diversity (total richness 36%, mean richness 31%, species turnover 33%).
   Conclusions: High spatial resolution satellite data are capable of supplying fine-scale habitat information that is relevant for the monitoring and conservation management of fine-scale plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Most generalisations about marine benthic diversity (species richness) are derived from few studies, few samples and low species numbers. It is questionable whether the data on which most paradigms, especially about the deep sea, are based truly represent general patterns of marine diversity. Available information from deep-sea studies are summarised and compared with some extensive data sets from the shallow coasts of Norway and Australia. We show that species richness per unit area is as high, if not higher in shallow sedimentary habitats as was reported for the deep-sea data by Grassle & Maciolek (1992; Am Nat 139:313-341). Apparent high diversity in the deep sea may be explained, in part, by the vast area of this environment. All surveys in both the deep-sea and coastal habitats are shown to traverse a variety of microhabitats and thus sediment heterogeneity is not an explanation for the high species richness in coastal environments.

AB  - As the area of plantation forest expands worldwide and natural, unmanaged forests decline there is much interest in the potential for planted forests to provide habitat for biodiversity. In regions where little semi-natural woodland remains, the biodiversity supported by forest plantations, typically non-native conifers, may be particularly important. Few studies provide detailed comparisons between the species diversity of native woodlands which are being depleted and non-native plantation forests, which are now expanding, based on data collected from multiple taxa in the same study sites. Here we compare the species diversity and community composition of plants, invertebrates and birds in Sitka spruce-(Picea sitchensis-) dominated and Norway spruce-(Picea abies-) dominated plantations, which have expanded significantly in recent decades in the study area in Ireland, with that of oak-and ash-dominated semi-natural woodlands in the same area. The results show that species richness in spruce plantations can be as high as semi-natural woodlands, but that the two forest types support different assemblages of species. In areas where non-native conifer plantations are the principle forest type, their role in the provision of habitat for biodiversity conservation should not be overlooked. Appropriate management should target the introduction of semi-natural woodland characteristics, and on the extension of existing semi-natural woodlands to maintain and enhance forest species diversity. Our data show that although some relatively easily surveyed groups, such as vascular plants and birds, were congruent with many of the other taxa when looking across all study sites, the similarities in response were not strong enough to warrant use of these taxa as surrogates of the others. In order to capture a wide range of biotic variation, assessments of forest biodiversity should either encompass several taxonomic groups, or rely on the use of indicators of diversity that are not species based.

AB  - Aim The spatio-temporal connectivity of forest patches in lowland agricultural landscapes and their age matter to explain current biodiversity patterns across regional as well as biogeographical extents, to the point that their effect exceeds the one of macroclimate for plant diversity in the understorey of temperate forests. Whether this remains true for other taxonomic groups is still largely unknown. Yet, this relative influence has important consequences for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services. Focusing on carabid beetle assemblages, we assessed the relative importance of macroclimatic, landscape and patch attributes in driving local species richness (alpha-diversity) and species dissimilarity between patches (beta-diversity).
   Location Deciduous forest patches in seven regions along a 2,100-km-long latitudinal gradient across the European temperate forest biome, from southern France to central Sweden.
   Methods We sampled 221 forest patches in two 5-km x 5-km landscape windows with contrasting management intensities. Carabid beetles were classified into four habitat-preference guilds: forest-specialist, forest-generalist, eurytopic and open-habitat species. We quantified the multi-level environmental influence using mixed-effects models and variation partitioning analysis.
   Results We found that both alpha- and beta-diversity were primarily determined by macroclimate, acting as a large-scale ecological filter on carabid assemblages among regions. Forest-patch conditions, including biotic and abiotic heterogeneity as well as patch age (but not patch size), increased alpha-diversity of forest species. Landscape management intensity weakly influenced alpha-diversity of forest species, but increased the number of non-forest species in forest patches. Beta diversity of non-forest species increased with patch heterogeneity and decreased with landscape management intensity.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the leading role of broad macroclimatic gradients over local and landscape factors in determining the composition of local carabid communities, thereby shedding light on macroecological patterns of arthropod assemblages. This study emphasizes the urgent need for preserving ancient forest patches embedded in agricultural landscapes, even the small and weakly connected ones.

AB  - Creation of permanent, semi-natural strips may contribute to increased plant diversity in agricultural areas if they function as habitats for new species. Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs, and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass crop during four years. Four of the 22 sown meadow herb species did not establish in the strips. Sowing increased both the number of meadow herbs and plant species diversity (calculated by the Shannon index) compared with the grass crop. Creating unsown strips did not increase the number of meadow herbs or plant species diversity. The created strips were colonized by woody species originating from the adjacent semi-natural field margin, but the meadow herbs present in the field margin did not colonize the strips. In the short term, establishment of sown strips would improve biodiversity locally. However, such strips will not serve as suitable habitats for the most vulnerable meadow herbs, and thus creation of new strips cannot compensate for loss of existing species-rich, semi-natural habitats.

AB  - It is increasingly evident that climate sustainability depends not only on societal actions and responses, but also on ecosystem functioning and responses. The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked-the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Significance StatementNatural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and heaths are key for the cycling and storage of water and carbon. Preserving these systems is essential for climate mitigation and adaptation and will also secure biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Systematic failure to recognize the links between nature and human well-being underlies the current trend of accelerating loss of nature and thereby nature's ability to buffer climate changes and their impacts. Society needs a new perspective on spatial planning that values nature as a sink and store of carbon and a regulator of hydrological processes, as well as for its biodiversity. We need policies that fully encompass the role of nature in preventing climate-induced disasters, along with many other benefits for human well-being.

AB  - This article aims to compare different forest adaptation strategies based on stand diversification from an economic perspective in order to reduce extreme drought- and windstorm-induced risks of dieback. We tested the efficiency of the strategies individually and then combined through a simulation study in which we evaluated the financial loss and the reduction of the carbon sequestration capacity. We used a stochastic forest growth model to simulate forest growth and carbon sequestration and developed a forest economic approach based on the land expectation value (LEV) to account for the stochastic simulations. Results showed that diversification increased timber production (from +4 to +81%) and LEV (from +27 to +398%), but reduced carbon storage (from -9 to -49%). Trade-offs between the financial balance and the carbon balance (adaptation vs. mitigation) are achievable. The valorisation of carbon services in addition to timber ones increases the forest value and changes the strategy that provides the highest economic return for a carbon price of 110 EUR/tC. Our study presents a new approach for the economic valuation of multiple risks in forest management, highlighting the importance of integrating several risks in a common analysis rather than investigating one risk at a time (traditional economic approach).

AB  - This study examines the economic and spatial impacts of afforestation choices for carbon sequestration in Ontario, Canada when the non-permanence of forestry carbon offsets is taken into consideration. We test six scenarios including three long-term projects with red pine, Norway spruce and hybrid poplar plantations and three shorter term hybrid poplar scenarios that produce temporary carbon emission offsets. We convert the break-even costs of sequestering carbon to a permanent carbon offset equivalent and analyze the possible geographical implications of the choices across eastern, southern and central Ontario, Canada. The most financially viable scenarios show a relatively large part of central Ontario with attractive choices at a 4% discount rate but a much smaller area at an 8% rate. The assumption about the future price evolution of temporary carbon offsets is one of the biggest factors that influence the attractiveness of these choices. At the 4% discount rate and the assumption of rising prices of permanent carbon offsets, the scenarios that store carbon for long periods appear to be the least-costly option. Hybrid poplar appears as the best choice in southern Ontario and a mix of conifer species and hybrid poplar in the central and northern parts. When future prices of temporary carbon offsets are assumed to decline, temporary hybrid poplar projects appear to be more attractive in the southern and eastern parts of the province. The variety of alternative scenario choices also depends on the discount rate and future price expectations for temporary carbon offsets. For a relatively narrow deviation of the carbon offset price (+/-$0.6 t(-1) CO2), only 4% to 9.2% of the total 5.8 million ha area would have one or more potentially viable alternative scenarios at the 4% discount rate and almost zero alternatives at the 8% rate. Higher discount rates lead to fewer attractive choices, suggesting that landowners would be left with very few options when trying to maximize net returns from plantations.

AB  - 1. Implementing multi-use forest management to account for both commercial and non-commercial ecosystem services is gaining increased global recognition. Despite its spatial extent, and great economic and ecological values, few studies have evaluated the boreal forest and its management to assess the potential for simultaneous delivery of a suite of ecosystem services.
   2. Using data from a Swedish long-term experiment, this study explores how biodiversity of the ground vegetation and potential delivery of multiple ecosystem services (timber production, carbon [C] storage and non-timber forest products) are influenced by two common silvicultural practices (thinning, fertilization and their interaction).
   3. Diversity (diversity indices and species richness) of the ground vegetation was higher in thinned than in unthinned forest, a result attributable in part to six species of lichens that only occurred in thinned forest. In addition, supply of lichens for reindeer forage was three times higher in thinned forest. Fertilization negatively affected the lingonberry shrub (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Timber production increased with fertilization, but decreased with thinning. The potential for C storage was highest in fertilized forests, which, apart from having the highest timber production, also supported the highest standing tree biomass.
   4. The silvicultural practices evaluated induced trade-offs among the ecosystem features studied as thinning increased biodiversity of the ground vegetation, production potential of wild berries and lichens, but reduced timber production and the potential for C storage. Fertilization had the opposite effect, promoting the potential for C storage at the expense of biodiversity and the ecosystem services delivered by the ground vegetation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Increased multi-use potential is a common goal for forest management in many parts of the world. Our result shows that commonly used silvicultural practices can be used to determine the multi-use output, and might be applied to maintain, or even increase the multi-use potential of the boreal forest biome. Nevertheless, trade-offs among values were common, indicating that the multi-use potential will be limited at the site level. Allowing management objectives to vary across the landscape might, in such cases, be a preferable way to achieve high multi-use potential.

AB  - The effect of tree species, stand structure, landscape and historical variables was studied on the species composition, species richness and cover of epiphytic bryophyte assemblages in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests of Western Hungary. Stand and tree level assemblages were analyzed by ordinations and generalized linear modeling in 3570-110 year old stands of different management regimes.
   Bryophytes showed a considerable preference to different host trees, so that stand level diversity of bryophyte assemblages was determined mainly by tree species diversity, and their composition by tree species composition. Cover and diversity of epiphytic bryophytes were the highest on oaks (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur), and the lowest on Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris). The presence of sapling (shrub) layer increased, whereas a large number of medium sized trees decreased bryophyte species richness in this study. Tree size was much less influential which is explained by the lack of large, veteran trees. Forest management maintaining tree species diversity, structural heterogeneity and temporal continuity of the stands could considerably contribute to the conservation of this organism group. Selective cutting is more appropriate for these conservational purposes than shelterwood management system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Geodiversity underpins biodiversity, but the contribution of specific geofeatures or landforms has rarely been explored. In this study, we use multiple vascular plant species diversity measures on alpha, beta and gamma levels to explore the linkage between biodiversity and co-located landforms (e.g. gullies, dunes and lake shores). We hypothesize that biodiversity will be positively related to geodiversity, which is founded on distinct landforms. Additionally, we propose that different landforms will sustain different amounts of biodiversity and that high alpha and gamma diversity values are related to landform-driven moisture availability whereas high beta diversity relates especially to landform-specific microtopographic variation. Location Rokua UNESCO Global Geopark area, Finland. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We compare vascular plant species richness measures, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, rarity-weighted richness and local contribution to beta diversity at altogether three levels of biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) for different landforms. Landform information is compiled from aerial photos, spatial data layers and targeted field surveys. We compare results to control habitat (i.e. sites without any distinct landforms) within the study area. Results Vascular plant diversity was higher on landforms than in control habitat. There was also notable variation between species diversity of different landforms. Moisture-rich gullies and river shores were especially diverse at all three levels, whereas aapa mires hosted most unique species composition (highest beta diversity). Beta diversity patterns were rather comparable with alpha and gamma diversity patterns, which contradict our hypothesis. Main conclusions This study quantitatively established a strong connection between terrestrial plant communities and multiple landforms. Our results highlighted the landform-controlled variation in soil moisture, microclimate and microtopography in enhancing plant species diversity. Based on the results, we promote the inclusion of landform-based geodiversity information in conservation management and in further biogeographical studies.

AB  - This study investigates conservation establishment and management in the context of Sweden's 30 national parks by conceptualising natural disturbances as focus events for conservation opportunities. Since positive effects on the environment manifest a long time after a natural disturbance, it may take time before society sees a need to conserve the natural area. To conceptualise such delayed responses to a focus event, the concept of a 'delayed window' is introduced. An analysis of Park Establishment Proposals from the Swedish Parliament for establishing and extending Sweden's national parks was conducted by sending a survey to county representatives for each national park (response rate 19/30). The results show that historic natural disturbances were mentioned as a motivating factor for establishing many of Sweden's 30 national parks (37%, i.e. 11 parks). The result suggests that the delayed window opens when biodiversity and Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) values of historic disturbance(s) become visible. The time span for motivating values is calculated for biodiversity values (18-829 years) and CES values (5-829 years). However, surveyed representatives responded that future disturbances may not be desired or only desired if controlled or limited, highlighting a paradox in terms of the perceived value of past and future disturbances.

AB  - Background: Increasing carbon stock in standing forests is one of the proposed ways to mitigate climate change. However, in production forests, this typically would lead to reduced harvesting possibilities and thus reduced financial gain for the forest owners. The size of this reduction should depend on the chosen target level of the carbon stock as well as the required speed of accumulation. Furthermore, due to landscape heterogeneity, the size of the loss can be expected to vary the planning scale, often related to forest property size.Aim: This study aimed to quantify the effects of spatial and temporal planning scales on the severity of the tradeoff between Net Present Value (NPV) of future timber sales and carbon storage in production forests in Southern Sweden.Methods: We used the Heureka PlanWise forest decision support system with built-in Linear Programming functionality. We created six Production Possibility Frontiers (PPF) that quantified the trade-off for the combinations of two scenarios for timing of carbon accumulation (either by 2100 or by 2100 with an intermediate target by 2045) and three spatial management scales (-3300 ha, -300 ha, and -60 ha; 1068 stands).Results: There was a strong effect of temporal scale, with consistently lower NPV, with the same carbon stock in 2100, when the intermediate target for 2045 was applied. The effect of the spatial scale was only apparent between the smallest (50 ha) scale and the larger scales (300 and 3300 ha), with consistently lower NPV with the same carbon stock at the smallest scale.Conclusion: We conclude that both the effects of spatial management scale and temporal scale on the cost of carbon storage should be considered in relation to potential climate policies.

AB  - We fogged 24 trees in two pine dominated forests in Norway with a synthetic pyrethroid in order to compare the canopy-dwelling fauna of arthropods between costal (Kvam) and boreal (Sigdal) sites and between old (250-330 yr) and mature (60-120 yr) trees at Sigdal. Almost 30000 specimens were assigned to 510 species; only 93 species were present at both sites. Species diversity, as established by rarefaction, was similar in old and mature trees. However, the number of species new to Norway (including nine species new to science) was significantly higher in the old trees. We suggest that the scarcity of old trees, habitat heterogeneity and structural differences between old and mature trees may explain these patterns. Productivity and topographic position at the site of growth explained the between-tree variation in species occurrence for the more abundant species, which were mainly Collembola and Oribatida. Species diversity was similar at the boreal and coastal sites, but there were clear differences in species composition.

The active diversity in communities of sphagnum moss biotopes was formed by 24 species. Minimal species diversity (3 species) and maximum density of organisms were noted in the driest habitat. In the habitats with the medium humidity levels, the level of species richness was similar (13-16 species) and the total density was determined by redox characteristics of the environment: under the conditions of oxygen deficit, it was two to three times lower than in an oxidized environment. The species composition specificity in sphagnum moss biotopes was determined by the degree of humidity: in the driest habitats, Arcella arenaria predominated; in the biotopes with medium humidity, Nebela tenella and Hyalosphenia elegans; and in the most humid biotopes, Hyalosphenia papilio and Heleopera sphagni. Communities of testate amoebae differed by species composition and integral characteristics at different sphagnum moss horizons: the abundance and species richness increased with depth. The proportion of living individuals in the total number of tests was 35 to 75%.

AB  - Islands are vulnerable ecosystems worldwide, increasingly exposed to human pressure, global climate change and invasive species. Thus, understanding island species diversity is key for nature conservation. Recent studies on insular plant communities indicated that habitat-specific species composition and richness might largely affect diversity patterns observed at the island scale. In consequence, habitat-based approaches are needed to (i) estimate how environmental changes at the habitat scale may affect island diversity, and to (ii) estimate the contribution of different patches of the same habitat to island diversity with respect to habitat-specific environmental constraints.
   In the present study, we tested these habitat-to-island diversity relationships for shoreline habitats (brackish reeds, salt marsh, rocky shore, tall herbs) and island interior habitats (rocks, semi-natural grassland, pioneer forest, coniferous forest, mixed forest) using 108 islands of three Baltic archipelagos in Sweden. These islands differed in terms of island-scale variables describing effects of island configuration and distance, and habitat-scale variables representing the effects of habitat area, abiotic environment and land-use.
   The studied habitats differed in their contribution to island species diversity, called habitat specificity. Shoreline habitats shared many common specialist species adapted to extreme conditions like sea salt or bird grazing, while habitats of the island interior harbored mainly species adapted to the specific conditions of a single habitat. We found high variability in habitat specificity as a consequence of habitat-specific environmental factors. Variability was highest for grasslands, where it was related to abandonment and soil fertility, stressing the importance of grassland management for maintaining island biodiversity. Habitats with high habitat specificity through either high species richness or many habitat-specific specialists should be the primary targets for biodiversity management.

AB  - The drastic loss of seminatural grasslands and the decrease in species diversity in Europe during the 20(th) century are closely linked to social-economic factors. Development in agricultural production drives land-use changes, and thus controls the capacity of landscapes to maintain biodiversity. In this study, we link agricultural production changes to landscape fragmentation and species diversity. Our results show that the termination of grazing on seminatural grassland caused significant changes in landscape structure and a decline in the number of vascular plant species. The decline of grazed grasslands has been driven mainly by farm-level economic efficiency and profitability interests, which have been connected with agricultural policy measures. Since 1995, when Finland joined the European Union, the area of grazed patches in our study area has again increased as a result of a support scheme for the management of seminatural grasslands.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effects of forest management on carbon sequestration in forests and wood products by using a gap-type forest model interfaced with a wood product model. The assessment is based on total carbon sequestration, i.e. the amount of carbon left in vegetation, litter, soil organic matter and products when the hows of carbon back to the atmosphere have been subtracted. Thirty mixed-species stands, representing medium fertility sites in southern Finland, were included in each simulation for 300 years under current climatic conditions and predicted conditions of changing climate.
   The average total balance for the first 100 years was higher in the unmanaged system than in the managed system, but for the second and third 100-year periods the results were clearly opposite. Differences in the total balance between the treatments were larger during the first 100 years than over the whole 300-year period. Under conditions of changing climate, differences in carbon sequestration between management options were more pronounced than under current climatic conditions. Under current climatic conditions with the 100-year time frame, the ratio between the total annual balance and annual gross production was 0.208-0.289. Over the whole 300 years, however, efficiency was much lower, 0.088-0.121. Under changing climatic conditions, efficiency was also lower, 0.182-0.252 and 0.081-0.096, respectively. Different management alternatives clearly produced different amounts of timber for the production process; under conditions of changing climate, timber production was substantially enhanced. However, total carbon storages at the end of the simulation varied less than timber production. In the managed system, the how back into the atmosphere was largest from litter, 41-51% of the total outflow, the how from vegetation was 23-28%, from soil organic matter 22-25%, emissions from products 1-7%, and emissions from landfills 0-3%. If emissions due to the use of machinery in timber harvesting and transportation were included, they made up only 0.03-0.33% of the total outflow. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how the age of a stand of post-agricultural Scots pine forests affects the species composition, biomass and the carbon stock of the forest understorey. The community structure and species composition were studied in 75 plots (100 m(2) in size), the amount of biomass, organic carbon and total nitrogen were analysed in 75 subplots (1/16 m(2) in size). The plots were located in 21 plantations with the stand age of 41-60, 61-80 and over 80-years. Results show that the understorey species diversity increased with the increasing age of Scots pine stands, and the structure and species composition of secondary forests (although managed for timber production) became similar to the fresh pine forest of the European temperate region (Leucobryo-Pinetum community). Despite the increasing species diversity, however, only six understorey vascular and moss species played an important role in the biomass accumulation and C sequestration. Due to the differences in the dominant species composition, the total amount of understorey biomass significantly differed among the forest stands. The mean moss biomass ranged from 3046 kg ha(-1) in 41-60-year-old stands, trough 2686 kg ha(-1) in 61-80-year-old stands to 2273 kg ha(-1) in over 80-year-old stands, and the mean understorey vascular plant biomass amounted to 2 kg ha(-1), 1924 kg ha(-1) and 3508 kg ha(-1), respectively. The concentration of organic C varied considerably between species; it was the highest in Vaccinium myrtillus (50.6%) and in Dicranum polysetum (49.5%). The total mass of C was nearly 800 kg ha(-1) in the youngest forests, in the subsequent age series it was two times higher and 3.5 times higher in the oldest ones. Differences in the species composition and in the C/N ratio in different species (generally higher for vascular plants and lower for mosses) were expressed in an increase in the understorey C/N ratio, which was 39.5, 46.6 and 48.6, respectively.

AB  - Nature-based tourism and recreation within and close to protected areas may have negative environmental impacts on biodiversity due to urban development, landscape fragmentation, and increased disturbance. We conducted a 3-year study of disturbances of birds induced by nature-based tourism over a recreational gradient in the Pallas-Yllastunturi National Park and its surroundings in northern Finland. Bird assemblages were studied in highly disturbed areas close to the park (a ski resort, villages, and accommodation areas) and in campfire sites, along hiking routes (recreational areas) and in a forest (control area) within the park. Compared with the forest, the disturbed urbanized areas had higher abundances of human-associated species, corvid species, cavity and building nesters, and edge species. The abundances of managed forest species were higher in campfire sites than in the forest. Hiking trails and campfire sites did not have a negative impact on open-nesting bird species. The most likely reason for this outcome is that most campfire sites were situated at forest edges; this species group prefers managed forests and forest edge as a breeding habitat. The abundances of virgin forest species did not differ among the areas studied. The results of the study suggest that the current recreation pressure has not caused substantial changes in the forest bird communities within the National Park. We suggest that the abundances of urban exploiter species could be used as indicators to monitor the level and changes of urbanization and recreational pressure at tourist destinations.

AB  - Ascertaining the patterns and determinants of soft-sediment biodiversity is critical to our overall understanding of coastal and marine processes. Studies of diversity in the deep sea and neritic waters have largely focused on levels of species diversity, differences in these levels along depth and geographic gradients, and how environmental characteristics within and among different geographic areas may drive the differences and patterns found. Among the environmental characteristics examined, habitat structure and heterogeneity have been identified as potentially playing a key role they play in shaping biodiversity patterns. Although habitat-related factors such as sediment characteristics have always been considered, it has been in the absence of any quantified benthic landscape framework. A benthic landscape, or benthoscape, is comprised of a set of patches that are repeated over a kilometers -wide area. Such patches have within-patch structure and in soft-sediments are often defined by their geophysical characteristics, although distinct biotic patches also can comprise a benthoscape. Benthoscapes contain the habitats that generate and support soft-sediment species diversity, and these habitats indeed are a component of overall biodiversity. Although, the study of benthoscape structure and dynamics is only now emerging, marrying this with research on biodiversity patterns will move our understanding of both forward. A landscape framework would provide a quantitative spatial context for analyses of biodiversity at multiple scales and can help resolve how habitat heterogeneity and structure affect biodiversity in soft-sediment environments. Such information may substantively help in sea floor management and conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diversity of fungi in semi-natural grasslands is poorly known. partly due to difficulties in species identification in the field but also because there are few specialists available. Diversity assessments of grassland fungi would be facilitated if a potential surrogate group for fungal diversity Could be identified. The aim Of this Study was to assess whether plant diversity patterns in semi-natural grasslands are congruent with diversity patterns of Waxcap (Hygrocybe spp.) fungi. Waxcaps, together with several other groups of fungi (e.g. the genera Entoloma, Dermoloma, Camarophyllopsis, and the families Clavariaceae and Geoglossaceae) have habitat requirements similar to many plants typical for semi-natural grasslands and they are all threatened by ceased management and nutrient enrichment. Diversity data from 31 semi-natural grasslands in southern Sweden were used to examine if there is congruence in species richness, nestedness, beta-diversity and species composition between plants and Hygrocybe fungi. Species richness of Hygrocybe was significantly positively correlated with plant richness, although the relationship was not strong (r(2) = 0.14). Both plant and Hygrocybe species composition was significantly nested. i.e. species-poor sites contain a subset of species from species-rich sites, which suggests that rare species mostly occur in the species-rich sites. A species similarity analysis between the grassland sites showed that there is low overlap between species composition of plants and Hygrocybe, indicating that conservation decisions based solely on plants may not fulfil the requirements of the Hygrocybe species. The conclusion is that there is low congruence between plant and Hygrocybe species diversity, making plants a poor surrogate group for Hygrocybe fungi, and probably also for other grassland fungi.

AB  - The time-dependent climate impact of beef production, including changes in soil organic carbon, was examined in this study. A hypothetical suckler cow system located in south-east Sweden was analysed using a time dependent life cycle assessment method in which yearly fluxes of greenhouse gases were considered and the climate impact in terms of temperature response over time was calculated. The climate impact expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, i.e. global warming potential in a 100-year time perspective, was also calculated. The Introductory Carbon Balance Model was used for modelling yearly soil organic carbon changes from land use. The results showed an average carbon sequestration rate of 0.2 Mg C ha(-1) and yr(-1), so carbon sequestration could potentially counteract 15-22% of emissions arising from beef production (enteric fermentation, feed production and manure management), depending on system boundaries and production intensity. The temperature response, which showed a high initial increase due to methane emissions from enteric fermentation, started to level off after around 50 years due to the short atmospheric lifetime of methane. However, sustained production and associated methane emissions would maintain the temperature response and contribute to climate damage. A forage-grain beef system resulted in a lower climate impact than a forage-only beef system (due to higher slaughter age), even though more carbon was sequestered in the forage-only system.

AB  - The construction sector faces the challenge of mitigating climate change with urgency. Life cycle assessment (LCA), a widely used tool to assess the climate impacts of buildings, is seldom used for bridges. Material-specific phenomena such as concrete carbonation and biogenic carbon storage are usually unaccounted for when assessing the climate impacts from infrastructure. The purpose of this article is to explore the effects these phenomena could have on climate impact assessment of road bridges and comparisons between bridge designs. For this, a case study is used of two functionally equivalent design alternatives for a small road bridge in Sweden. Dynamic LCA is used to calculate the effects of biogenic carbon storage, while the Lagerblad method and literature values are used to estimate concrete carbonation. The results show that the climate impact of the bridge is influenced by both phenomena, and that the gap between the impacts from both designs increases if the phenomena are accounted for. The outcome is influenced by the time occurrence assumed for the forest carbon uptake and the end-of-life scenario for the concrete. An equilibrium or 50/50 approach for accounting for the forest carbon uptake is proposed as a middle value compromise to handle this issue.

AB  - Allozyme variation was studied in Swedish populations of Silene vulgaris (a widespread weed), S. uniflora sap. uniflora (restricted to coastal habitats) and S. uniflora ssp. petraea (endemic to Sweden and confined to open limestone habitats). The taxa are diploid, gynodioecious, perennial herbs and showed high levels of within-taxon and within-population gene diversity at four polymorphic loci. Within-taxon diversity was highest (H-tax=0.52) in S. vulgaris and lowest (H-tax=0.36) in S. uniflora ssp. uniflora. The weedy S. vulgaris has more alleles than either of the other two taxa and 5 out of a total of 27 alleles are unique to S. vulgaris. Most of the gene diversity within each of the taxa is accounted for by within-population diversity. The between-population component of diversity is 10% in S. vulgaris, and 24% and 5%, respectively, in S. uniflora ssp, uniflora and ssp. petraea. Hybrids may occur between S. vulgaris and S. uniflora, but introgression is limited by the species' ecology. Neither allozyme nor distributional data support the suggestion that ssp. petraea is a recent hybrid between S. vulgaris and S, uniflora ssp. uniflora, although an older hybrid origin for sap. petraea is possible. Patterns of allele frequency variation suggest that there has been some historical gene flow between taxa, outside their present areas of sympatry. It is likely that the two subspecies of S. uniflora, which occur in naturally open habitats, were able to colonize Sweden during the Late Glacial or early post-glacial, whereas S. vulgaris followed the spread of agriculture into Sweden.

AB  - Eutrophication is a major threat to aquatic ecosystems, because excessive nutrient enrichment may result in the loss of ecosystem services. Fjord systems are specifically under pressure due to nutrient input from land (agriculture) and sea (aquaculture). In this bioassay study, we have analyzed the effect of different nutrient sources, as well as their combination, on growth, nutrient composition and recruitment of habitat-forming and ephemeral macrophytes. We found that agricultural fertilizer increased growth for all algae (except Fucus), while the fish farm effluents mainly increased growth of Ulva. The C:N ratio was hardly affected by the fish farm, but decreased significantly in all algae when agriculture fertilizer was added. Most interestingly, however, distance to the fish farm modulated the algal response to the fertilizer. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying effects of multiple stressors in aquatic ecosystems to sustainably manage the consequences of anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Crop diversification and maintenance of semi-natural habitats (grasslands and field boundaries) are suggested to enhance farmland biodiversity, but the relative importance of these factors remains poorly known. We evaluated how crop diversity and availability of semi-natural grasslands at a landscape-scale interacted with local farming management (three management types from low to high intensity: ley < winter wheat < sugar beet) in their effect on ground beetle assemblages in southern Sweden. Ground beetle diversity increased with crop diversity either independently of local management (Simpson species diversity), or only in the less intensively managed habitats (rarefied species richness). While ground beetle diversity in leys tended to increase with field boundary length, no such relationship was observed in winter wheat or sugar beet fields. In contrast, the landscape proportions of leys and semi-natural grasslands did not affect ground beetle species richness and diversity. We conclude that (a) semi-natural grasslands and leys may not function as source habitats at a landscape-scale if they comprise a low proportion of the total land-use, while (b) increasing crop diversity is correlated to ground beetle richness and diversity in agricultural landscapes dominated by arable land. The beneficial effect of landscape-scale crop diversification on farmland biodiversity may depend on the general level of agricultural intensity of a region.

AB  - Ungulate impacts on forest understory alter tree species composition, with cascading effects on forest functions and resilience against future climate conditions. Indeed, the ungulate browsing pressure on tree seedlings is species-specific and causes contrasted growth reductions that alter tree recruitment rates. Untangling the effects of browsing from the effects of the other factors driving regeneration success is required to guide the forest and ungulate management. In particular, Fagus sylvatica L. strongly dominates temperate Quercus-Fagus forests close to their climax, and it remains unclear if controlling ungulate populations can maintain tree species diversity in naturally regenerated forests. We addressed this question by monitoring 734 pairs of fenced and unfenced 6-m(2) plots across a broad gradient of Cervus elaphus L. abundance in Belgian Quercus-Fagus forests managed by continuous cover forestry. Seedling height, density, and vegetation cover were monitored from 2016 to 2021. Species diversity and ecological affinity for light, temperature, and atmospheric humidity conditions were computed from these measures. With ungulates, the mean growth of Betula pendula Roth. and Sorbus aucuparia L. was negligible, whereas, without ungulates, their growth was higher than the growth of other species. With ungulates, the growth of Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst was higher than other species. Quercus (Quercus petreae (Matt.) Liebl and Quercus robur L.) growth was the lowest in all conditions. Finally, Carpinus betulus L. was heavily browsed but still grew higher than its competitors with ungulates. Ungulate browsing can then severely affect seedling growth and likely reduce the diversity of future recruited trees. In the study area, browsing unfavored the regeneration of the species that are less shade tolerant, more-drought tolerant, and more-heat tolerant. It thus accelerates the natural succession and reduces forest resilience to heat and drought events. Such an observation was found valid over a wide study area encompassing contrasting levels of Cervus elaphus L. abundance. Combining further reductions of ungulate populations with foodscape improvement is likely required to maintain species diversity in these forests.

AB  - Although Finland's forest resources have been utilized intensively, the size of the total volume of the growing stock has increased since the mid-1960s, and hence increasing amounts of carbon have been sequestered by forests. The net sequestration by forests has also been substantial when compared with the CO2 emissions resulting from energy generation and consumption based on fossil fuels and peat. It is also important, from the point of view of mitigating the effects of climate change, to assess how the sequestration capacity of forests may change under changing climatic conditions. This paper presents the results of a study assessing the development of the forest and wood-product carbon budget for Finland, based on regionally measured data, detailed dynamic models, and recent predictions concerning the changing climate. At the starting point for the simulation (1990), nearly 90% of the forest sector's carbon storage was found in the forest. Regular management transferred carbon from forests to wood products. Under the current climatic conditions, the simulated forest carbon storage increased 45% by the year 2100, and the wood-product storage by 320%, as a consequence of continuous production. Under changing climate conditions, the forest carbon storage increased, but started to decline when the temperature increase exceeded 2.5 degrees C within 40 years.

AB  - Investigating the influence of evolutionary forces on the genetic structure and genetic diversity remains a major challenge. Yet, it is of considerable interest for conservation and management of a species. This study investigates the influence of life-history and landscape features, such as altitude, connectivity and habitat size, on genetic diversity and genetic structure of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) with stream-resident, lake-dwelling and sea-migrating life-history in two river systems in northern Sweden. Using regression tree analysis including ecological and landscape characteristics, we show that life history is the most important variable explaining genetic diversity and population differentiation. Sea-migrating populations show high diversity and low differentiation, and lake- and stream-resident populations show low diversity and high population differentiation, among all samples. No overall genetic correlation with geographical distance was noted; however, among sea-migrating populations within the River Vindelalven drainage, this pattern was observed. This study illustrates that life-history and landscape features help to explain genetic structure and genetic variation. The information is important for conservation and management actions, such as fisheries regulations, habitat restorations, stocking of hatchery fish, defining management units and introducing genetic monitoring programmes.

AB  - Wetland creation aiming at a simultaneous increase in nutrient retention and species diversity in agricultural landscapes has recently become applied as a catchment-scale compensation measure for past wetland losses. Here, we evaluate if, and to what extend, dual-purpose wetlands benefit local and regional diversity of agricultural landscapes. We analysed composition and alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among dual-purpose wetlands in an agricultural region in southwest Sweden in relation to local (water quality, wetland morphology, succession stage, proximity to other aquatic habitats) and landscape parameters (regional connectivity, wetland density). Diversity of mature agricultural ponds was used as a standard to evaluate the value of dual-purpose wetlands. Dual-purpose wetlands sustained alpha, beta, and gamma diversity similar to that of natural lentic water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the region and elsewhere. Over 80% of the overall species richness was attributed to beta diversity, and each created wetland contributed to overall species accumulation. Ecosystem parameters explained 19% of the compositional variation among assemblages, but were only marginally related to diversity. Wetland density promoted alpha and gamma diversity, while spatial heterogeneity (beta) remained equally high, independent of wetland density. Our results indicate that catchment-scale wetland creation for simultaneous retention and diversity purposes benefits the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes, particularly if the density of aquatic habitats is increased by at least 30%.

AB  - Competition between the economic and natural assets of forests is emphasised in capercaillie lekking sites, which are often located within production forests. In this study, we assessed the potential use of carbon offsets as income for the management of capercaillie lekking sites. We ran simulations and optimisations for two alternative forest management scenarios in ten forest holdings located in five different regions of Finland. The size of each forest holding was approximately 30 hectares, of which 5 hectares was included in a lekking site. The basic scenario followed forest management recommendations, and the carbon sequestration scenario aimed to enhance biodiversity maintenance in a way that enabled carbon offsets to be obtained for the lekking site. We found that the decrease in revenue from timber sales was generally so small that the income from carbon offsets provided an economically better choice. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of carbon sequestration did not seem to be restricted to a specific location. The approach we introduced can be utilised in future decision making in the forestry sector to promote the coordination of nature management and forestry. Moreover, carbon pools should be considered more comprehensively in future research.

TI  - INTRODUCTION OF THE PAID ANNUAL LEAVE IN ESTONIA
T2  - ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA
LA  - Estonian
AB  - At the beginning of the 20th century when some European countries introduced paid annual leave for employed persons, this phenomenon was unknown to Estonian workers. After the World War I more and more countries guaranteed paid annual leave for their workers under pressure of trade unions.
   There was no strong trade union movement in Estonia; therefore, seven days paid leave was introduced in 1934 by the law as a result of rather external than internal social pressure. Law of 1934 guaranteed one week paid annual leave only for industrial workers. In this respect, Estonia was not exceptional among other member states of International Labour Organization (ILO), as there were few countries where paid leave was guaranteed for all employees by law or collective agreement.
   In the second half of the 1930s, many European countries extended not only workers' rest periods including paid holidays but also expanded paid holidays for all types of workers to follow the requirements of the 1936 ILO Conventions and Recommendation on Holidays with Pay. The ILO standards on paid leave, as well as the impact of labour laws of Finland and other Scandinavian countries, were reflected in Estonia's new law on paid leave of 1940, despite opposition from employers who considered the extension of paid holidays economically unrealistic.
   The new law guaranteed all employees working under an employment contract (except seasonal workers and seamen) the right to paid leave after one year of continuous service. The duration of the holiday depended on the length of the employment and was between one and two weeks.
   Introducing the statutory entitlement to seven day paid annual holiday in 1934 to industrial workers, extending the duration of holiday, and expanding it to wider category of workers in 1940, Estonia took a major step towards harmonizing its social policy with that of other, more progressive Member States of ILO. However, the law of employment contract did not include several categories of employees, the paid leave was not available for all Estonian workers. Paid holidays were very important for the improvement of workers' health, but also for the improvement of their economic conditions and the quality of life, which in turn had a positive effect on productivity.
   Introduction of paid leave raised the question about the possibilities to spend the vocation time actively.
   Most of the Estonian workers spent their holidays in the home environment and continued to be engaged in traditional leisure activities such as playing in amateur theatre groups, attending concerts and theatre shows, going to the movies, reading books, listening to the radio, visiting relatives, participating in the activities of cultural and educational associations and enjoying vacation at the beach. Travelling or spending family vacation in holiday homes was an option for limited amount of Estonian workers due to low income. However, the Estonian trade unions under the influence of Scandinavian organizations tried to build holiday homes and organize weekends in tourist farms and guest houses in the countryside away from the everyday environment.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in peatlands rely on consistently high water tables. Anthropogenic pressures including drainage, burning, land conversion for agriculture, timber, and biofuel production, cause loss of pressures including drainage, burning, land conversion for agriculture, timber, and biofuel production, cause loss of peat-forming vegetation and exposure of previously anaerobic peat to aerobic decomposition. This can shift peatlands from net CO2 sinks to large CO2 sources, releasing carbon held for millennia. Peatlands also export significant quantities of carbon via fluvial pathways, mainly as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We analyzed radiocarbon (C-14) levels of DOC in drainage water from multiple peatlands in Europe and Southeast Asia, to infer differences in the age of carbon lost from intact and drained systems. In most cases, drainage led to increased release of older carbon from the peat profile but with marked differences related to peat type. Very low DOC-C-14 levels in runoff from drained tropical peatlands indicate loss of very old (centuries to millennia) stored peat carbon. High-latitude peatlands appear more resilient to drainage; C-14 measurements from UK blanket bogs suggest that exported DOC remains young (<50years) despite drainage. Boreal and temperate fens and raised bogs in Finland and the Czech Republic showed intermediate sensitivity. We attribute observed differences to physical and climatic differences between peatlands, in particular, hydraulic conductivity and temperature, as well as the extent of disturbance associated with drainage, notably land use changes in the tropics. Data from the UK Peak District, an area where air pollution and intensive land management have triggered Sphagnum loss and peat erosion, suggest that additional anthropogenic pressures may trigger fluvial loss of much older (>500year) carbon in high-latitude systems. Rewetting at least partially offsets drainage effects on DOC age.

AB  - Ongoing climatic changes potentially affect tree-line ecosystems, but in many regions the observed changes are superimposed by human activities. We assessed how the forest-tundra ecotone has changed during the last century in the Putorana Mountains, northern Siberia, an extremely remote and untouched area in Eurasia. A space-for-time approach was used to determine the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest structure and biomass along an altitudinal transect. From the closed larch forest to the upper tree line, the mean age of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) decreased considerably from 220 to 50 years ago. At the current upper species line, there is a strong and successful germination of larch, with 1500 saplings per hectare, indicating an ongoing filling-in, a densification of a formerly open forest and an upslope shift of the tree-line position (approximately 30 to 50 m in altitude during the last century). The forest expansion coincided with large increases in winter precipitation during the 20th century. In contrast, tree growth rates were significantly positively related to summer temperatures, neither of which increased markedly. The total aboveground biomass decreased from approximately 40 t ha(-1) in the closed larch forest to 5 t ha(-1) at the tree line. Our study demonstrates that ongoing climatic changes lead to an upslope expansion of forests in the remote Putorana Mountains, which alters the stand structure and productivity of the forest-tundra ecotone. These vegetation changes are very probably of minor importance for aboveground carbon sequestration, but soil carbon data are needed to estimate the impact of the forest expansion on the total ecosystem carbon storage.

AB  - Some species may increase community diversity by modifying the local environment for co-occurring species. This is most common in habitats of high abiotic stress. To explore whether the mat-forming dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala functions as a nurse plant in alpine and arctic plant communities of contrasting but generally stressful environmental conditions, we measured species diversity, richness, cover, and composition of different functional groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens) inside and outside Dryas mats at sites differing in environmental severity at Finse, alpine Norway, and in arctic Svalbard. Dryas appears to function as a nurse plant primarily for bryophytes, and mainly at the most severe sites in Svalbard. At the more benign sites at Finse, total diversity (Shannon's index) and richness, and richness of all functional groups, were lower inside Dryas than outside, suggesting that Divas has no nurse plant function on diversity parameters there. Species composition, however, differed inside and outside Dryas in all the communities, due to both presence/absence and abundance differences at Finse, and primarily due to differences in species abundances in Svalbard. This may suggest that Dryas functions as a nurse plant for individual species of all of the three functional groups in all the communities, even if competitive impacts of Dryas may overrule the positive effects on a whole-community level. Finally, our results show that Dryas may shift from being a nurse plant to being a competitor when its cover increases, but only under relatively low abiotic stress.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) limitation constrains plant growth, but complex interactions among species and ecosystems hinder our ability to identify primary drivers of N availability. Hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological processes interact spatially and temporally, requiring measurements of N across diverse ecosystem types and as a function of both site conditions and vegetation composition. We measured initial exchangeable and mineralized N along a hydrologic gradient in the Alaskan perhumid coastal temperate rainforest to test a conceptual model of linkages between N availability and landscape, hydrologic, and ecosystem characteristics in temperate forests. Mineralization was closely associated with inorganic N concentrations. Inorganic N as NH4+ generally increased with increasing depth to groundwater but was strongly determined by plant-water interactions. Exchangeable and mineralized N were closely linked to tree species, forest biomass, and hydrologic regime regardless of ecosystem type. The emergence of tree species as indicators of N cycling highlights the effect that species have on nutrient dynamics, while the trend of increasing inorganic N with increasing soil saturation points to the role of hydrology in driving N availability. Our research quantified N dynamics for an understudied, yet critical, system and provides a framework for exploring feedbacks among soil saturation, forest composition, and nutrient cycling in temperate forests.

AB  - A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The carbon sequestration services of stormwater wet retention ponds were investigated in four different climates: U.S., Northern Sweden, Southern Sweden, and Singapore, representing a range of annual mean temperatures, growing season lengths and rainfall depths: geographic factors that were not statistically compared, but have great effect on carbon (C) accumulation. A chronosequence was used to estimate C accumulations rates; C accumulation and decomposition rates were not directly measured. C accumulated significantly over time in vegetated shallow water areas (0-30 cm) in the USA (78.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), in vegetated temporary inundation zones in Sweden (75.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and in all ponds in Singapore (135 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Vegetative production appeared to exert a stronger influence on relative C accumulation rates than decomposition. Comparing among the four climatic zones, the effects of increasing rainfall and growing season lengths (vegetative production) outweighed the effects of higher temperature on decomposition rates. Littoral vegetation was a significant source to the soil C pool relative to C sources draining from watersheds. Establishment of vegetation in the shallow water zones of retention ponds is vital to providing a C source to the soil. Thus, the width of littoral shelves containing this vegetation along the perimeter may be increased if C sequestration is a design goal. This assessment establishes that stormwater wet retention ponds can sequester C across different climate zones with generally annual rainfall and lengths of growing season being important general factors for C accumulation.

AB  - Boreal forest stands with high herbaceous plant species diversity have been found to be one of the main habitats for many endangered species, but the locations and sizes of these herb-rich forest stands are not well known in many areas. Better identification of the stands could improve both their conservation and management. A new approach is proposed here for locating the mature herb-rich forest stands using airborne laser scanner (ALS) data and logistic regression, or the k-NN classifier. We show that ALS technology is capable of distinguishing the ecologically important herb-rich forests from those growing on less fertile site types, mainly on the basis of unique but quantifiable crown structure and vertical profile that characterise forests on high fertility sites. The study site, Koli National Park is located on the border of the southern and middle boreal vegetation zones in Finland, and includes 63 herb-rich forest stands of varying sizes. The model and test data comprised 274 forest stands belonging to five forest site types varying from very fertile to poor. The best overall classification accuracy achieved with the k-NN method was 88.9%, the herb-rich forests being classified correctly in 65.0% of cases and the other forest site types in 95.7%. The best overall classification accuracy achieved with logistic regression was 85.6%, being 55.0% for the herb-rich forests and 94.3% for the other forest site types. Both methods demonstrated promising potential for separating herb-rich forests from other forest site types, although slightly better results were obtained with the non-parametric k-NN method, which was capable of utilising a higher number of explanatory variables. It is concluded that ALS-based data analysis techniques are applicable to the detection of mature boreal herb-rich forests in large-scale forest inventories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rhodiola rosea (Crassulaceae) is a traditional adaptogen medicinal plant. Several studies have described that the species shows significant diversity in morphological characteristics. Furthermore, according to several experiments, not only the age of the plant but also the geographical origin has an influence on the secondary metabolites profile of roseroot. The aim of our work was to investigate variations among Finnish roseroot populations. Roseroot is living in the northern parts of Finland, around latitude 69 degrees. We examined eight habitats, of which six were found around Kilpisjarvi (500 m elevation) and two were on the Halti hill (1000 m elevation). Six individuals were selected from all populations. The inter- and intra-population variability was examined by the use of ISSR and SSR markers. The average content in active compounds (rosin, rosavin, rosarin, salidroside) of the populations was also measured, and the variability of the secondary metabolites content was compared with the results of the genetic marker analysis. Both molecular marker techniques revealed low genetic variability within and moderate variability among the populations, which is similar to that of other Rhodiola species.

AB  - Increasing pressure to diversify development of national parks emphasizes the need for new and relevant information for park management decisions. In this paper, we use choice experiment to value different tradeoffs that evolved in park development scenarios. Specifically, we examine which kind of development profiles are worth considering and which paths not to follow. We focus on biodiversity and recreational services provided by Oulanka National Park in Finland, which represents a popular recreation site attracting a large number of visitors. The increase of biodiversity was the most highly valued feature by the respondent national park visitors. Thus, our results show that the protection of biodiversity and recreational and tourism use of national parks can cause conflicting welfare effects if managed in inappropriate ways. Increasing the number of visitors, expanding present resting places, constructing new resting places and an intense increase in information boards, especially if combined with shrinking biodiversity, are welfare reducing managerial actions in national parks.

AB  - Effects of snag characteristics on saproxylic beetles were studied in an area of managed beech forest in southern Sweden. A snag survey was combined with a beetle survey using 30 small window traps directly attached to beech snags. The total number of species was lower in the snags which were most decayed than in the three younger decay classes, while the number of red-listed species remained the same regardless of the stage of decay. The number of fresh wood species declined and the number of rot hole species increased with increasing snag decay. The diversity of fungicolous and decayed wood species peaked at the intermediate stage of decay in the snags. CCA ordination confirmed that the stage of decay in the snags was most important for species composition, followed by sun exposure. There were no general differences in species density and composition between managed and unmanaged stands. Our study suggests that most species are able to find suitable habitat within a radius of a few kilometres and that the total amount of habitat in an unfragmented forest area is more important for species diversity than the spatial distribution of this habitat. Our data also shows that species diversity increases with habitat diversity. Snags formed from giant beech trees seem to be particularly important for rare species living in rot holes. We conclude that for a high species diversity there is a requirement for snags in different stages of decay, size and degree of sun exposure.

AB  - Urban areas harbour diverse nature ranging from semi-natural habitats to wastelands, parks and other highly human-influenced biotopes with their associated species assemblages. Maintenance of this urban biodiversity for the residents and for its intrinsic value in the face of increasing population and expanding cities requires that ecological knowledge should be better integrated into urban planning. To achieve this goal understanding of ecological patterns and processes in urban ecosystems is needed. The first step in the necessary urban ecological research is to find out what kind of nature exists in cities. Second, knowledge about ecological processes important in urban nature is required. Although ecological processes in cities are the same as in rural areas, some of them, such as invasion by alien species, are more prevalent in urban than in rural conditions. Third, based on ecological knowledge, management schemes maintaining the diversity of urban nature should be designed. These procedures should also include protection of urban nature, e.g. in urban national parks. Finally, as ecology alone cannot provide the complex information about human influence on urban ecosystems, interdisciplinary research involving natural and social sciences is imperative for a holistic approach to integrating ecology into the process of urban planning.

AB  - Aim Distribution modelling is a useful approach to obtain knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity, required for, for example, red-list assessments. While distribution modelling methods have been applied mostly to single species, modelling of communities and ecosystems (EDM; ecosystem-level distribution modelling) produces results that are more directly relevant for management and decision-making. Although the choice of predictors is a pivotal part of the modelling process, few studies have compared the suitability of different sets of predictors for EDM. In this study, we compare the performance of 50 single environmental variables with that of 11 composite landscape gradients (CLGs) for prediction of ecosystem types. The CLGs represent gradients in landscape element composition derived from multivariate analyses, for example "inner-outer coast" and "land use intensity." Location Norway. Methods We used data from field-based ecosystem-type mapping of nine ecosystem types, and environmental variables with a resolution of 100 x 100 m. We built nine models for each ecosystem type with variables from different predictor sets. Logistic regression with forward selection of variables was used for EDM. Models were evaluated with independently collected data. Results Most ecosystem types could be predicted reliably, although model performance differed among ecosystem types. We identified significant differences in predictive power and model parsimony across models built from different predictor sets. Climatic variables alone performed poorly, indicating that the current climate alone is not sufficient to predict the current distribution of ecosystems. Used alone, the CLGs resulted in parsimonious models with relatively high predictive power. Used together with other variables, they consistently improved the models. Main conclusions Our study highlights the importance of variable selection in EDM. We argue that the use of composite variables as proxies for complex environmental gradients has the potential to improve predictions from EDMs and thus to inform conservation planning as well as improve the precision and credibility of red lists and global change assessments.

AB  - Bioenergy is expected to contribute to mitigating climate change. One major source for bioenergy is woody biomass from forests, including logging residues, stumps, and whole trees from young dense stands. However, at increased extraction rates of woody biomass, the forest ecosystem, its biodiversity, and its ability to contribute to fundamental ecosystem services will be affected. We used simulation and optimization techniques to assess the impact of different management strategies on the supply of bioenergy and the trade-offs between wood fuel harvesting, biodiversity, and three other ecosystem services-reindeer husbandry, carbon storage, and recreation. The projections covered 100 years and a forest area of 3 million ha in northern Sweden. We found that the development of novel and cost-effective management systems for biomass outtake from young dense stands may provide options for a significant supply of bioenergy to the emerging bioeconomy, while at the same time securing biodiversity and important ecosystem values in future stand developments. In addition, there is potential to increase the extraction of harvest residues and stumps while simultaneously improving conditions for biodiversity and the amount of carbon stored in forest ecosystems compared to current levels. However, the projected continuing trend of increased forest density (in terms of basal area) has a negative impact on the potential for reindeer husbandry and recreation, which calls for researching new management strategies on landscape levels.

AB  - Background: Small-scale topographic complexity is a characteristic feature of alpine landscapes, with important effects on alpine plant distribution.
   Aims: We investigated the links between small-scale topographic complexity and resultant microclimatic heterogeneity, vascular-plant species richness and beta diversity, and realised niche width and trait variation of some target species.
   Methods: We recorded temperature and soil moisture within 10 sites (40mx40m) of differing topographic complexity in alpine terrain at Finse, Norway (N 60 degrees 36MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, E 7 degrees 33MODIFIER LETTER PRIME). Plant species occurrence and traits of target species were recorded in 16 sample plots at each site.
   Results: Sites differed significantly in microclimatic heterogeneity, and topographically rough sites were always more heterogeneous than flatter ones. Greater species richness and turnover was associated with greater microclimatic heterogeneity, and rough sites contained 15-55% more species than flatter ones. Plant species had on average wider realised niches when growing at rough sites. Individuals of Bistorta vivipara, but not those of Luzula spicata, tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation at rough sites.
   Conclusions: Rough alpine terrains create small-scale variation in microclimate, promoting species richness and beta diversity. In the event of climate change, small-scale microclimatic heterogeneity might allow plant species to escape from regional climate change by short-distance migration to local micro-refugia. This study suggests that the opportunity for such responses would be greater in topographically complex terrains.

AB  - We show that benthic freshwater communities of naturally acidic streams in boreal catchments differ depending on properties of the surrounding landscape. Although low pH usually is associated with negative impacts on species diversity and ecosystem function, here decomposition by insects and microbes as well as the abundance of leaf-eating insects were generally high at low pH and at humic sites influenced by mire-dominated compared with forest-dominated surroundings. Moreover, in situ growth experiments showed that the survival of two of the most abundant insect species was higher when they originated from mire-influenced sites, underscoring their tolerance to low pH. However, species diversity generally increased with pH and was greater at forest-influenced than at mire-influenced sites. Although less diverse, acidic and humic streams proved to be functional and supported distinct macroinvertebrate assemblages. Diversity and function in naturally acidic streams are apparently greatly influenced by the prevailing kinds of landscape-driven influences on water chemistry. In conclusion, well-known negative impacts of anthropogenic acidity on diversity and function may not apply to naturally acidic systems that are chemically and biologically heterogeneous.

AB  - Maintaining and increasing biodiversity level especially in pure plantations is one important way to improve the resistance of forests to pests in Chinese boreal forests. The present study tested the hypothesis that the increased degree of tree species mixture (quantified by the stem proportion of Betula platyphylla Suk. and Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr.) can affect the species richness and diversity of understory and insects. Twenty-one plots, ranging from pure larch stand to pure birch stand, were sampled in several thinned forests in a Chinese boreal forest area. Data of environmental factors, understory plant species and insect assemblage were collected from the field and connected with historical records, and analyzed using, e.g., multivariate methods and de-trended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA). The results showed that the variation of plant and insect species was mainly influenced by birch mixture and light conditions in the forest. Species richness and diversity of plants and insects increased with the increasing mixture of birch, and finally declined after passing the peak point in 30% or 50% of birch mixture. The study gives tools to improve the integrated pest management (IPM) especially in man-made pure plantations of boreal forests in China.

AB  - Background: One of the key forest characteristics is the biodiversity, particularly the diversity of trees which are forest ecosystem engineers. Nowadays the most worldwide common approach for assessment of forest conditions and dynamics is based on the systematic monitoring, performed at a set of regularly structured plots. To fulfill the existing gap in this sort of knowledge on the Russian forests, an extensive study of tree species diversity on a regular network was conducted in north-west of Russia.
   Methods: The study used the ICP Forests monitoring network that spans over 1700 km along the western Russian border from forest-tundra in the north to broadleaved-coniferous forests in the south. Tree data were collected at 710 sites that were assigned along a regular grid. We performed series of statistical analyses of the tree species distribution and diversity in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors.
   Results: According to the Maxent species distribution modelling results only Pinus sylvestris, Betula sp. and Picea abies have the potential to grow throughout the study area. The locally maximum tree species diversity varies along the latitudinal gradient from 1 to 3 species in the north to 5-7 species in the south. Monocultural stands are relatively abundant across the study area, being especially common in the south taiga. The prevailing part of the monocultural stands is represented by Scots pine (72%). The age distribution of dominant trees has a clear connection with the intensity of forest use. We found that recent wildfire events had only little effect on tree diversity in the study area.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that ICP Forests monitoring network enables to successfully establish the main qualitative and quantitative relations of the spatial variation of tree species diversity to climatic, landscape, soil and anthropogenic factors. Analysis of the influence of these factors on tree species distribution allowed us to conclude that with the continuing trend of reducing the frequency and intensity of fires, Norway spruce will further replace Scots pine and Betula sp. in the north-western Russia. Extending the monitoring network, especially adding the time-series context, could provide novel appealing opportunities for forest dynamics projection and sustainable management.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban forests provide multiple ecosystem services for city dwellers, including water, opportunities for recreation and tourism, climate regulation and habitat provision. Despite growing scholarly attention to urban forests, few studies to date have conducted comprehensive assessments of their ecosystem services. This study conducts an interdisciplinary and wide-ranging assessment of ecosystem services of Oslomarka, the emblematic forest surrounding Oslo, Norway's capital city. First, we set the historical background and examine drivers of change shaping forest uses and ecosystem service composition at the study area. Second, we identify, characterize and measure ecosystem services delivered at the study area. Third, we assess trends in these ecosystem services over the past 50 years. Three main findings are highlighted. First, institutional, technological, and cultural factors are the main drivers of change shaping current ecosystem service composition. Second, ten ecosystem services and three sub-services were assessed and characterized, with water and opportunities for recreation and tourism found to be of particular prominence to locals. Third, our results show that provisioning and habitat services have declined over the past fifty years, while carbon sequestration and storage has increased. Cultural services increased overall, while also experiencing major changes in their nature and composition. Our research reveals the fundamental importance of Oslo's urban forests and its ecosystem services for the well-being of local inhabitants.

AB  - Question: How does agricultural land usage affect plant species diversity in semi-natural buffer strips at multiple scales?
   Location: Leps m River watershed, Nurmijarvi, Southern Finland.
   Methods: Species diversity indicators included both richness and evenness. Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324 ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses.
   Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coefficients for species richness at the second largest scale (196 ha). The density of arable field edges between the fields was the only metric that correlated with species evenness for all scales, which had highest predictive power at the second smallest scale (36 ha).
   Conclusions: Species richness and evenness of buffer strips had scale-dependent relationships to land use in agricultural ecosystems. The results of this study indicated that species richness depends on the pattern of arable land use at large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool. Meanwhile, species evenness depended on the level of field edge density at small scales, which relates to how the nearby farmland was divided by the edges (e. g. many small-scale fields with high edge density or a few big-scale fields with low edge density). This implies that it is important to manage the biodiversity of buffer strips within a landscape context at multiple scales.

AB  - Plantation forestry is the ultimate alternative in reforesting degraded tropical ecosystems and in provisioning multiple ecosystem services beyond timber production. Therefore, we studied the management of Tectona grandis L.f. (teak) plantations in Costa Rica and simulated alternative management strategies incorporating simultaneously the values of carbon storage, biodiversity and timber production. Alternative management strategies included (1) extension of rotations, (2) reduced thinning and (3) conversion of even-aged to uneven-aged systems. Evaluation criteria were carbon storage in biomass, stand structural diversity as a proxy of biodiversity, and economic return from timber harvests. For growth predictions under future climatic conditions, we calibrated the hybrid forest growth model 3PG. We found that carbon storage could be increased by increasing rotation periods (e.g. + 29.7% of carbon for a 50% increase in rotation length) and a no thinning management (+ 9.5% of carbon). For rotation extension associated economic losses were high (e.g. at 5% discount rate, the Land Expectation Value (LEV) decreased by 25.1% for a 50% extension of rotations). For thinning LEV increased with a low-thinning regime, but decreased with a no-thinning management (+ 9.5% and 23.6%, respectively). Payments for ecosystem services (PES) increased economic return by about 3-4%. Structural diversity increased by conversion to uneven-aged forest stands (Gini coefficients for basal area increased from 0.21 to 0.52). Economic returns from timber harvests were almost equal for even-aged and uneven-aged systems at 1% discount rate (max. -2% of LEV). At 5% discount rate, we observed economic losses of 11.1-20.1% compared to the even-aged scenario. At 10% discount rate, economic losses ranged between 43.6 and 104%. We concluded that extension of rotations and reduction of thinning intensity can be used as management strategies to increase the carbon storage of teak plantations. However, to compensate the associated economic losses through a PES scheme, payments for carbon sequestration need to be increased and special incentives for longer rotation periods and low thinning management need to be developed. The transformation into uneven-aged forest stands requires active investment at discount rates higher than 1%. Whether this investment can be offset by benefits from biodiversity and increased forest resilience is unknown and requires further investigations. Other measures of biodiversity conservation, such as the use of native and mixed tree species and the retention of old trees and deadwood are moreover necessary.

AB  - The study deals with the problem of evaluating management strategies for pure stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst) to balance adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, taking into account multiple objectives of a forest owner. A simulation and optimization approach was used to evaluate the management of a 1000 ha model Age-Class forest, representing the age-class distribution of an area of 66,000 ha of pure Norway spruce forests in the Black Forest region of Southwest Germany. Eight silvicultural scenarios comprising five forest conversion schemes which were interpreted as "adaptation" strategies which aims at increasing the proportion of Beech, that is expected to better cope with climate change than the existing Norway spruce, and three conventional strategies including a "Do-nothing" alternative classified as "mitigation", trying to keep rather higher levels of growing stock of spruce, were simulated using the empirical growth simulator BWINPro-S. A linear programming approach was adapted to simultaneously maximize the net present values of carbon sequestration and timber production subject to the two constraints of wood even flow and partial protection of the oldest (nature protection). The optimized plan, with the global utility of 11,687 a,not sign/ha in forty years, allocated a combination of silvicultural scenarios to the entire forest area. Overall, strategies classified as "mitigation" were favored, while strategies falling into the "adaptation"-category were limited to the youngest age-classes in the optimal solution. Carbon sequestration of the "Do-nothing" alternative was between 1.72 and 1.85 million tons higher than the other alternatives for the entire forest area while the differences between the adaptation and mitigation approaches were approximately 133,000 tons. Sensitivity analysis showed that a carbon price of 21 a,not sign/t is the threshold at which carbon sequestration is promoted, while an interest rate of above 2% would decrease the amount of carbon.

AB  - During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, coniferous monocultures were introduced, replacing natural broadleaved forests in Central Europe, mainly for economic benefits. In the mountains, Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst] was introduced in large areas previously covered with beech forests and also in natural riverside habitat corridors such as river valleys, despite its negative impact on the soil environment by e.g. organic matter accumulation, decrease of soil pH and changes in C/N ratio. We aimed to check how long-term Norway spruce plantations affect species richness and diversity of soil mites along a mountain river in former mixed and broadleaved forests. The study, based on 342 samples, was carried out in Stoowe Mountains National Park (SW Poland). Understory species biomass, soil pH and soil organic layer thickness significantly affected soil mite communities. Although coniferous forests did not differ from either broadleaved or mixed forests in mite density (number of individuals m(-2)) and species diversity (H), they were characterized by low species richness and proportional abundance of Uropodina mites typical for broadleaved forests. In total, 4849 mites classified into 57 species were recorded from all forest types and no unique species were found in the sampled forests. Although the mite communities were dominated by the same common species (Veigaia nemorensis, Paragamasus runcatellus, Leptogamasus obesus and Trachytes aegrota), they still maintain the rare species of broadleaved forests and their high recovery potential may be used in forest conversion.

AB  - Herb-rich forests are often considered biodiversity hotspots in the boreal zone but their fungal assemblages, particularly those of wood-decaying fungi, remain poorly known. We studied herb-rich forests as habitats for polypores, a distinct group of wood-decaying fungi, and assessed the importance of tree- and stand-scale variables for polypore species richness, abundance. and diversity, including red-listed species. The data include 71 herb-rich forest stands in Finland and 4797 dead wood items, on which we made 2832 observations of 101 polypore species. Dead-wood diversity was the most important variable explaining polypore species richness and diversity, whereas increasing latitude had a negative effect. Red-listed species showed a positive response to the abundance of large-diameter dead wood, which, especially birch, supported also high general abundance of polypores. The composition of polypore assemblages reflected their host-tree species. The red-listed species did not show explicit patterns in the ordination space. Compared to old-growth spruce forests, herb-rich forests seem to host lower polypore species richness and less red-listed species. However, because of high proportion of deciduous trees in the dead wood profile, herb-rich forests have a clear complementary effect on polypore assemblages in boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - The features of the historical formation of modern natural landscapes in the city area of Saint Petersburg are described. The role of protected areas of the city as an "ecological framework" for the preservation and maintenance of the urban environment and the specific problems of urban nature protected areas (PAs) are considered. The data on the location, area, and species diversity of mammals in each of the existing nature protected areas of Saint Petersburg are presented. The reasons for the differences in the faunas of the protected areas of the northern and southern coasts of the Gulf of Finland due to their landscape and geographical characteristics and the current state of habitats are revealed. Based on the above data, it is concluded that the increased anthropogenic load in some protected areas leads to the reduction or disappearance of mammal groups such as ungulates or large carnivores. However, in other areas, the composition of fauna remains close to the natural, and the number of observed mammal species is up to 80% of the region's inhabitants.

AB  - IntroductionPlanting trees in urban areas can mitigate some of the emissions generated in cities by carbon sequestration (annual uptake of CO2 through the process of photosynthesis) and carbon storage (amount of carbon stored in the tree's biomass throughout its lifespan). The aim of this study was to calculate the carbon footprint from nursery production to final establishment of different tree species grown for planting in urban parks in a northern European context. Material and methodsThe analysis included a cradle-to-gate approach and investigated the amount of carbon the adult trees needed to sequester in order to compensate for initial carbon emissions and which temporal perspectives are of concern. Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated based on an inventory of consumption of fuels, energy, materials and other production inputs during cultivation, delivery, planting and establishment of three different tree species in three different locations in Sweden. The tree species considered in the analysis (Salix alba, Quercus rubra, Pinus sylvestris) were selected due to significant differences in their growth rates. Salix alba is a competitive strategist in resource-rich habitats, and is proficient at converting these resources into vigorous growth. Pinus sylvestris is a pronounced stress strategist with good ability to handle resource-limited habitats, and invests in traits accordingly, resulting in significantly slower development. Quercus rubra has its main distribution in cool and moderately resource-rich habitats, but has relatively high stress tolerance and can be considered intermediate between the other two species in terms of growth rate. Results and discussionThe results showed that within 16 years of planting, all species in all three cities, except Pinus sylvestris planted in Umea, compensated for initial carbon emissions, i.e. showed net absorption of CO2 after emissions from cultivation, delivery, planting and establishment of the trees had been deducted. There was a clear link between the time by which compensation of initial carbon emissions was achieved and growth rate of the different species, with the fast-growing Salix alba showing the best results. The single largest source of emissions among all activities carried out during cultivation, delivery and planting of all species, regardless of the city in which they were planted, was fuel consumption during tree planting.

AB  - Species diversity of polypores (Basidiomycetes) was compared between woodland key habitats (WKHs) and old-growth forest controls in boreal forests in eastern Finland. WKHs, which were set aside for their rich vascular plant flora, turned out not to be hot spots for the species richness of polypores, nor did their species composition represent the overall species richness of the area. Differences in the total volume of CWD, tree species composition and several CWD qualities were reflected as differences in the species assemblages between the groups. The results indicated that only a fraction of the overall polypore diversity was represented in the small-size WKHs (< 0.5 ha), and the protection of red-listed and indicator polypores in WKHs was random. However, rare old-growth forest indicators were found even in small-size WKHs, if the CWD quality was appropriate for them. Nevertheless, our study does not answer the question whether the occurrences of rare and red-listed species will survive in small-size WKHs surrounded by altered environments such as clear-cuts, because our study sites were located in undisturbed areas. The results stress the importance to protect typical old-growth forest patches with high CWD volume and quality in boreal forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nature-based tourism is increasingly encouraged to support local socioeconomic development in and around protected areas, but managing protected areas for tourism could challenge existing park uses associated with self-organized outdoor recreation and local resource use. We used a web-based Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) to identify the most important places and values of local, domestic, and international visitors to Jotunheimen National Park and Utladalen Protected Landscape in Norway. Scenic and recreation values were prioritized by all groups, but local users mapped more values relating to hunting, fishing, gathering and cultural identity. While the three user groups overlapped in some places, we found that they self segregated to some extent. Our study affirms the importance of spatially explicit analyses to support protected area management. Understanding the spatial distribution of values held by different user groups can aid in designing tourism management strategies that minimize intergroup conflict.

AB  - Forest disturbance regimes are intensifying in many parts of the globe. In order to mitigate disturbance impacts a number of management responses have been proposed, yet their effectiveness in addressing changing disturbance regimes remains largely unknown. The strong positive relationship between forest age and the vulnerability to disturbances such as windthrows and bark beetle infestations suggests that a reduced rotation length can be a potent means for mitigating the impacts of natural disturbances. However, disturbance mitigation measures such as shortened rotation lengths (SRL) can also have undesired consequences on ecosystem services and biodiversity, which need to be considered in their application.
   Here, we used the process-based landscape and disturbance model iLand to investigate the effects of SRL on the vulnerability of a 16,000 ha forest landscape in Central Europe to wind and bark beetle disturbances. We experimentally reduced the current rotation length (between 100 and 115 years) by up to -40% in 10% increments, and studied effects on disturbance dynamics under current and future climate conditions over a 200-year simulation period. Simultaneously, we quantified the collateral effects of SRL on forest carbon stocks and indicators of biodiversity. Shortening the rotation length by 40% decreased disturbances by 14%. This effect was strongly diminished under future climate change, reducing the mitigating effect of shortened rotation to <6%. Collateral effects were severe in the initial decades after implementation: Reducing the rotation length by 40% caused a spike in harvested timber volume (+92%), decreased total forest carbon storage by 6% and reduced the number of large trees on the landscape by 20%. The long-term effects of SRL were less pronounced. At the same time, SRL caused an increase in tree species diversity. Shortening rotation length can reduce the impact of wind and bark beetle disturbances, but the overall efficiency of the measure is limited and decreases under climate change. Given the potential for undesired collateral effects we conclude that a reduction of the rotation length is no panacea for managing increasing disturbances, and should be applied in combination with other management measures reducing risks and fostering resilience.

KW  - WILD REINDEER
AB  - Discussions about the purpose and management of Norway's first national park evolved along different lines than planning did elsewhere in the world. First proposed in 1956 by local mountain boards wishing to protect wild reindeer, Rondane National Park opened in December 1962 with a significantly altered management emphasis. Prior to 1960, Norway had yet to adopt a national system for the conservation of large areas, and, therefore, local actors could set the terms of the debate. In 1960, however, the nation established a more comprehensive system for nature conservation, reshaping conservation in ways that prioritized the core actors over those on the periphery. The newly empowered administrator emphasized outdoor recreation, the preservation of pristine nature, and the protection of cultural traditions rather than wild reindeer. Rejecting a proposal for a management board for Rondane that would have included local representatives, Norwegian officials opted to emphasize national priorities and, in so doing, set a precedent for subsequently organized national parks.

AB  - Swedish climate policy targets net zero greenhouse gases (GHG) by mid-century, with road transport independent of fossil fuels by 2030, requiring far-reaching changes in the way energy is used. Forest management is expected to support carbon sequestration and provide biomass for various uses, including energy. In this paper, we combine two energy scenarios with four forest scenarios and quantify GHG balances associated with energy-use for heat, electricity, and road transport, and with forest management and production, use, and end-of-life management of various forest products, including products for export. The aggregated GHG balances are evaluated in relation to the 2-degree target and an allocated Swedish CO2 budget. The production of biofuels in the agriculture sector is considered but not analyzed in detail.
   The results suggest that Swedish forestry can make an important contribution by supplying forest fuels and other products while maintaining or enhancing carbon storage in vegetation, soils, and forest products. The GHG neutrality goal is not met in any of the scenarios without factoring in carbon sequestration. Measures to enhance forest productivity can increase output of forest products (including biofuels for export) and also enhance carbon sequestration. The Swedish forest sector can let Sweden reach net negative emissions, and avoid "using up" its allocated CO2 budget, thereby increasing the associated emissions space for the rest of the world.

AB  - On a planet experiencing constant human population growth, it is necessary to explore the anthropogenic effects on the genetic diversity of species, and specifically invasive species. Using an analysis that integrates comparative phylogeography, urban landscape genetics, macrogenetics and a systematic review, we explore the worldwide genetic diversity of the human commensal and anthropogenic species Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Based on metadata obtained considering 35 selected studies related to observed heterozygosity, measured by nuclear molecular markers (microsatellites, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms-SNPs-, restrictition site-associated DNA sequencing -RAD-Seq-), socioeconomic and mobility anthropogenic factors were used as predictors of genetic diversity of R. rattus and R. norvegicus, using the Gini index, principal component analysis and Random Forest Regression as analysis methodology. Population density was on average the best predictor of genetic diversity in the Rattus species analyzed, indicating that the species respond in a particular way to the characteristics present in urban environments because of a combination of life history characteristics and human-mediated migration and colonization processes. To create better management and control strategies for these rodents and their associated diseases, it is necessary to fill the existing information gap in urban landscape genetics studies with more metadata repositories, with emphasis on tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

AB  - Plant species diversity of woodland patches in the agricultural landscapes of different geographical regions (Finland, Estonia, Lithuania) have been studied. During the field studies (1990-1993) a total of 127 woodland patches was investigated (42 in Finland, 44 in Estonia and 41 in Lithuania). In each wood patch the following variables have been identified: number of tree and shrub species (in Estonia also herb species), area, age, disturbance, distance to the nearest woodland patch, and number of soil types (in Finland, the number of forest site types). On the basis of measured variables the coefficient of biotope heterogeneity, the coefficient of age and disturbance, the gamma-diversity (Whittaker, 1977) and the edge index have been calculated. A multiple regression model has been developed and compared with an analogous model designed by Rudis and Ek.
   The model describes comparatively well the tree, shrub and herb species richness of the woodlots in the Estonian study area. In Lithuania and southern Finland the correlation between variables was significant but relatively low. Therefore, no multiple regression model has been compiled for these study areas. The best correlation has been found with the number of species and the woodland patch area. There was no connection between the species number and isolation level in all three areas. The diversity of species increases considerably from north to south. Because of nitrogen loading in small woodlots of the Estonian study area nitrophilous herb species mostly dominate.

AB  - Establishing mixed-species plantations on the reclaimed coastal lands has become a new paradigm in forest management in China, because it increases the provision of ecosystem services. However, the mixing effects of trees with different identities remain largely understudied. In subtropical China, plantations have been historically dominated by monocultures, the conversion of which to mixed plantations are now required considering the need of sustainable forestry development. In this study, we evaluated the soil carbon sequestration, nutrient accumulation, and understory regeneration of three coastal plan-tations with different compositions established 12 years ago, on a reclaimed area in Eastern China. Plots on two scales (30 m x 20 m for trees and 1 m x 1 m for understory vegetation) were set up to conduct vegetation inventory and soil sampling to compare growth parameters, soil physical and chemical properties, and understory composition. We found that coniferous-mixed forest (CMF) had significantly higher soil available water capacity; both CMF and broadleaved-coniferous mixed forest (B-CMF) had significantly higher soil capillary porosity and soil moisture content at saturation; broadleaved mixed forest (BMF) had a greater soil permeability coefficient. Among soil chemical properties, we observed that CMF had higher soil organic carbon stock and cation exchange capacity in both 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers. CMF and B-CMF had higher hydrolysable ni-trogen and total potassium in both soil layers; BMF had higher available phosphorus contents. Moreover, B-CMF supported better canopy tree growth and higher understory plant species diversity. Therefore, our results showed that the introduction of broad-leaved trees into the coniferous-dominated plantations established on the reclaimed coastal lands produced significant effects on soil properties and understory species diversity. Thus, our study may facilitate the development of new afforestation regimes to mitigate the po-tential impact of increasing environmental changes by improving our understanding of species composition effects on coastal forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Forest management has actively reduced proportion of deciduous trees in Fennoscandian managed forests. Several species of cryptogams and invertebrates depend on deciduous trees, among which aspen (Populus tremula L.) is especially important. The occurrence and abundance of several terrestrial gastropod species are linked to aspen leaf litter. However, the impact of forestry practices on the gastropod communities is largely unknown. We examined difference in species richness, diversity (H'), and species composition in the gastropod fauna in aspen stands in a 400 km(2) managed boreal forest area in northern Sweden by collecting them with masonite boards from 20 selected stands. We contrasted isolated (>500 m from the neighboring stand) and aggregated (<300 m from neighboring stand) stands, stands close to arable land (<50 m) and stands in the forest, and used locations outside the aspen stands in the surrounding forest as controls. Stand sizes ranged from 100 to 3000 m(2).
   Gastropod species richness and diversity were high in aspen stands near arable land and in aggregated stands in the forest and low in controls. Both diversity and assembly composition of the gastropods in isolated aspen stands in the forest interior were intermediate between, and did not differ significantly from, controls and other aspen stands. Species diversity and richness increased with stand area up to an area of 700 m(2). We conclude that aspen stands in this managed boreal forest landscape are important for gastropods, even for species that are not strict habitat specialist connected to aspen. The total amount and the distribution of aspen in the landscape also may be important, since many species can be lost if area and connectivity of aspen stands drop to low levels. The positive species-area relationship suggests that future forestry practice should favor stands at least 500 m(2) (0.05 ha) preferably in connection to other stands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Rates of biodiversity loss remain high, threatening the life support system upon which all human life depends. In a case study, a novel biodiversity composite index (BCI) in line with the Convention on Biological Diversity is established in Tyrol, Austria, based on available national forest inventory and forest typing data. Indicators are referenced by ecological modeling, protected areas, and unmanaged forests using a machine learning approach. Our case study displays an average biodiversity rating of 57% out of 100% for Tyrolean forests. The respective rating for ecosystem diversity is 49%; for genetic diversity, 53%; and for species diversity, 71%. Coniferous forest types are in a more favorable state of preservation than deciduous and mixed forests. The BCI approach is transferable to Central European areas with forest typing. Our objective is to support the conservation of biodiversity and provide guidance to regional forest policy. BCI is useful to set restoration priorities, reach conservation targets, raise effectiveness of financial resources spent on biodiversity conservation, and enhance Sustainable Forest Management.

AB  - Understanding changes of ecosystem services and their influencing factors is crucial for more sustainable ecosystem management and conservation of nature contributions to people, especially in regions suffering high pressure from climate change and human activities, such as the Nordic countries. In this study, we assess multiple ecosystem services and their influencing factors in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. We analyze changes in ecosystem services such as habitat quality, sediment retention, water yield, carbon sequestration, crop and roundwood production between 2003 and 2018. The relationships between ecosystem services and the main influencing factors (temperature, precipitation, elevation, population, livestock, and land use change) are assessed by means of the Spearman's correlation coefficient and a new method that unravels synergies or tradeoffs at a grid level. Given the importance of forest management in the study region, an advanced land cover dataset that includes maps of forest harvest is produced and used as a basis for the analysis. Results show the large changes in ecosystem services during the study period and their spatial variations. Overall, the habitat quality is decreased, especially in the sites affected by forest management and agricultural production. Water yield and sediment retention increased due to higher precipitation (mainly in Norway). Higher temperature and forest management have generally increased carbon sequestration and provisioning services. The relationship between ecosystem services and their potential influencing factors differs across space. There are 10 out of 15 pairs of ecosystem services that predominantly show a tradeoff relationship, while the rest shows a synergy. In general, our results show the importance to monitor ecosystem services and understand the main drivers of their changes, so to design more sustainable resource management strategies that can secure a long-term delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Land use changes and forests both play an important role in combating climate change. The climate effects of forest land consolidation have, however, not been studied in detail. As such, this study identifies a number of possible climate effects of forest land consolidation. To specify these, the increased carbon storage in the Pahkakoski land consolidation project (Finland) due to increased forest growth is valued through substitution costs. The results show that the value of the increased carbon storage in the project area is approximately 750 000 euros, or (sic)153/ha. This emanates from the increased growth due to remedial drainage and from the increased forested area. The result is, however, sensitive to changes in the shadow price of carbon. Likewise, the study recognises a need for studies concerning the total climate effect of measures, such as remedial drainage that may also release carbon from the ground. While the overall effects of forest land consolidation are difficult to estimate with current knowledge, this article highlights the potential of land consolidation to combat climate change.

AB  - Afforestation and reforestation are considered important measures for climate change mitigation. Because the land area available for tree planting may serve multiple purposes, striking the right balance between climate goals and other objectives is crucial. We conducted a survey of the Norwegian population to investigate potential land-use conflicts that may arise from executing a large-scale afforestation programme. Respondents were presented with three land-use alternatives to replace formerly grazed agricultural land. We used manipulated landscape photos to elicit their underlying value orientations. We combined multiple correspondence analysis with latent class regression models to reveal preference heterogeneity. Our models grouped respondents into three latent classes, with 24%, 24% and 52%, respectively, expressing a preference for forest carbon sequestration, recreation or agriculture as the most crucial land-use function to be retained. Birth year emerged as a strong predictor of class membership. Specifically, generations born before 1970 were more inclined to support the continuation of agricultural landscapes, while those born in 1980 and later showed a stronger inclination towards natural forest succession for carbon sequestration or recreational purposes. Quantitatively, every 10-year reduction in age increased the odds of a respondent belonging to the forestation or recreation class (relative to the agricultural class) by a factor of 2. Interestingly, even among respondents who were classified as most climate concerned, natural forests were 50% more likely to be preferred over monoculture spruce plantation as a policy option. This suggests that there may be public resistance to spruce planting for climate mitigation purposes in Norway.

AB  - Europe's forests provide vital habitat for biodiversity and essential ecosystem services whose provision must be sustained or enhanced over the coming century. However, the potential to secure or increase forest ecosystem services, while securing the habitat requirements of taxa remains unclear, especially within the context of uncertain climate and socio-economic developments. To tease out the associated trade-offs and synergies, we used 10 case study landscapes within nine countries throughout Europe. Starting with the current status of the forests in the case study landscapes, we simulated forest development 100 years into the future. Simulations were embedded in three combined climate and socio-economic frame scenarios based on global and European policies which varied in their climate change mitigation efficiency. Scenarios were translated into country specific projections of climate variables, and resultant demands for wood products. Forest management regimes were projected to vary in response to these scenarios at local scales. The specific combinations of alternative forest management practices were based on parallel research and input from local forest stakeholders. For each case study, a specific forest growth simulator was used. In general, the climate scenarios applied did not cause fundamentally different ecosystem service outputs at the case study level. Our results revealed almost no reduction in outcomes for biodiversity indicators with an increase in wood production, and in some cases synergistic results occurred when diversity was actively promoted as part of the management concept. Net carbon uptake was not strongly correlated with biodiversity, indicating that biodiversity-friendly forest management doesn't need to curtail carbon sequestration. Notably, we obtained heterogeneous results for the relation between sustainable wood production and net carbon uptake. Most scenarios resulted in a more or less reduced net carbon uptake over the long term, often due to stand age class distribution shifts. Levels of sustainable wood production varied widely during the simulation period, from significant increases (Sweden, Lithuania) to minor changes (Slovakia, Turkey) and slight decreases (Ireland, Netherlands). We place our results within the larger context of European forest policy and the challenges of simulating and contrasting forest biodiversity and the ecosystem services that societies depend on.

AB  - In sustainable forestry, forests should produce multiple ecosystem services for society, such as timber, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Therefore, in the evaluation of forest management strategies, we have to consider the impacts of management on several ecosystem services. In this study, we compared the effects of five different forest management strategies on timber drain, carbon stocks, carbon balance and biodiversity indicators, while maximizing economic revenues from timber production. The assessment was carried out in a boreal landscape of 43000 ha over a 100-year calculation period. The five management strategies were rotation forest management (with thinning from below or above), continuous cover forestry, a combination of rotation forest management and continuous cover forestry and any-aged forestry. Rotation forest management with thinning from below was less profitable than the other strategies, which were close to each other in economic profitability. Rotation forest management with thinning from below was also the poorest in terms of carbon stocks, carbon balance and biodiversity indicators. Any-aged and continuous cover forestry were the best in terms of carbon sequestration and biodiversity indicators. In general, management strategies that used thinning from above and that were not restricted to rotation forest management as the only option provided more ecosystem services and were also economically profitable. Such management strategies may help to satisfy the increasing demand for diverse uses of forests.

AB  - The dictyostelid social amoebae (Dictyostelia) occur in terrestrial habitats worldwide. It has been observed previously that their diversity decreases with increasing latitude and altitude. Here we look at dictyostelid diversity in the high latitude habitats of Northern Sweden. Dictyostelids were recovered from soil samples using traditional plating methods and then identified using morphological characters and molecular sequence (small subunit ribosomal RNA) data. In total, nine species were recovered, including two new species, described herein as Dictyostelium barbibulus and Polysphondylium fuscans. The species diversity found here is discussed in relation to previous findings in the area as well as other high-latitude studies, and biogeographical patterns are examined. The total number of species found in Northern Sweden is lower than the numbers recorded for regions further south in Europe, a finding consistent with a latitudinal gradient of species diversity. Our findings highlight the benefit of using molecular data for accurate species identification in Dictyostelia and the need for a continued sampling effort to better understand their diversity and distribution, especially in high latitude habitats.

AB  - Boreal forest ecosystems are predicted to experience more frequent summer droughts due to climate change, posing a threat to future forest health and carbon sequestration. Forestry is a regionally dominant land use where the managed secondary forests are typically even-aged forests with low structural and tree species diversity. It is not well known if managed secondary forests and unmanaged primary forests respond to drought differently in part because the location of primary, unmanaged, forests has remained largely unknown. Here we employed a unique map detailing over 300 primary forests in Sweden. We studied impacts of the 2018 nationwide drought by extracting and analyzing a high-resolution remote sensing vegetation index over the primary forests and over buffer zones around the primary forests representing secondary forests. We controlled for topographical variations linked to soil moisture, which was a strong determinant of drought responses, and analyzed Landsat-derived EVI2 anomalies during the drought year from a multiyear non-drought baseline. We found that primary forests were less affected by the drought compared to secondary forests. Our results indicate that forestry may exacerbate the impact of drought in a future climate with more frequent and extreme hydroclimatic events.

AB  - The influence of forest management on fungal diversity and community composition has been the subject of a wide number of studies over the last two decades. However, the difficulty of studying the complex kingdom of fungi under real forest conditions has led to rather scattered scientific knowledge. Here, we provide the current state of knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii) silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods, selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi. The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv) landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained.

AB  - QuestionsWhat are the most important drivers of plant species richness (gamma-diversity) and species turnover (beta-diversity) in the field layer of a forest edge? Does the tree and shrub species richness structure and complexity affect the richness of forest and grassland specialist species?
   LocationSoutheast Sweden.
   MethodsWe sampled 50 forest edges with different levels of structural complexity in agricultural landscapes. In each border we recorded trees, shrubs and herb layer species in a 50-m transect parallel with the forest. We investigated species composition and species turnover in relation to the proportions of gaps in the border and the diversity of trees and shrubs.
   ResultsTotal plant species richness in the field layer was mainly explained by the proportion of gaps to areas with full canopy cover and tree diversity. Increasing number of gaps promoted higher diversity of grassland specialist species within the field layer, resulting in open forest borders with the highest overall species richness. Gaps did however have a negative impact on forest species richness. Conversely, increasing forest species richness was positively related to tree diversity, but the number of grassland specialist species was negatively affected by tree diversity.
   ConclusionsManaging forest borders, and therefore increasing the area of semi-open habitats in fragmented agricultural landscapes, provides future opportunities to create a network of suitable habitats for both grassland and deciduous forest specialist species. Such measures therefore have the potential to increase functional connectivity and support dispersal of species in homogeneous forest/agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Increasing attention is given to carbon sequestration in forest soil with regard to climate change and the mitigation of its impacts; therefore, it is very important to know which parameters and variables could influence carbon sequestration and throw light on their relationships. The aim of this study is to assess the role of abiotic variables, chemical elements and stand parameters in soil carbon sequestration, and clarify which of these could affect soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the surface mineral horizon in Norway spruce and European beech stands in the Czech Republic. We analyzed 81 monitoring plots within pure and mixed stands of spruce and beech with different degrees of forest naturalness. In each monitoring plot, SOC content, chemical elements (content of bound forms of oxides: tFe, tAl, tCa, tMg, tK, tMn, tP, tN) and related variables (BS, pH, C/N) were measured. The effect of these variables, including abiotic variables (elevation, temperature, precipitation, duration of growing season and soil group) on SOC content was tested, and differences between represented stands (natural vs. unnatural, pure vs. mixed, spruce vs. beech) were analyzed. The results showed that elevation has a positive relationship to SOC content. Of the studied chemical elements and related variables, only tN content was significantly related to SOC content. A positive relationship was also demonstrated between forest naturalness and SOC content. The highest SOC and tN contents were observed in pure natural Norway spruce stands, which likely play a very important role in SOC sequestration. In the context of the current issue of unnatural Norway spruce stands in the Czech Republic, a higher SOC content was found in mixed natural European beech stands than in either pure or mixed unnatural Norway spruce stands. Therefore, replacing the unnatural Norway spruce stands in the study area with mixed natural European beech stands could represent a viable alternative to current forest management in terms of soil carbon sequestration, especially in the context of global climate change and spruce dieback.

AB  - The Finnish mining and mineral exploration disputes (MMEDs) of the 2000s started with the uranium dispute (2006-2008), when the global mining industry rushed into Finland. The Finnish mining skeptical movement originated by focusing on projects associated with uranium. One of these projects, the Talvivaara polymetallic mine, became the key event of the following mining dispute because of its gypsy pond leakage in 2012. Many disputes have persisted for years, while others have ended, and new ones have appeared.
   Twenty ongoing disputes were identified in Finland. Fourteen of the cases are related to mineral exploration, four to mine projects, and two to mines. The long-term disputes are mostly focused on mines and mine projects in northern Finland, whereas the most recent disputes are mostly related to mineral exploration in southeastern Finland. The main reasons for disputes are the conflicting use of land (indigenous Sami homeland, lake regions with holiday homes, nature conservation, reindeer herding, and tourism), an association with uranium, poor corporate conduct (lack of communication and stakeholder engagement) and/or reputation.
   The identification, mapping and monitoring of MMEDs in Finland will support future studies regarding the analysis of their causes, dynamics, evolution, actors, and possible solutions. Their investigation can help to understand and avoid disputes, conciliate diverse interests, and solve disagreements.

AB  - The diversity of saproxylic bryophyte species in beech forest stands from the wide region of the central Balkans (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro) was studied, and this study is the first of such a type in SE Europe. Comparison of preserved old-growth and managed forests were made. Bryophyte species diversity is higher in primeval forest stands where the spectra of dead wood in various decaying stages of its dynamics are present. The ecological group of epixylic specialists is predominant among the bryophytes recorded. Threatened bryophyte species occur in old-growth beech stands. The dead wood as habitat together with some other factors are extremely important for the surviving of epixylic bryophyte; so these species can be used as bioindicator bryophyte species of old-growth or managed and structured forest ecosystems.

AB  - This paper investigates the recreational experience preferences (REP) of visitors to Fulufjallet National Park, Sweden. Data were derived from a pilot study conducted in the summer of 2005 by Colorado State University on behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the European Tourism Research Institute. A total of 107 Swedish and international visitors were surveyed on-site. Analysis included reliability and exploratory factor analyses to investigate the motivational aspects of visitors to Fulufjallet National Park. Aims were to examine motivations of visitors in a Northern European national park using REP items from a North American context and to examine REP's potential for cross-cultural use. Four primary REP dimensions were identified including self-discovery, experience of places, seeking solitude and challenging self. Implications for management and the Scandinavian context are given along with the cultural context of allemansratten and friluftsliv.

AB  - Changes in climate and land use, caused by socio-economic changes, greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural policies and other factors, are known to affect both natural and managed ecosystems, and will likely impact on the European terrestrial carbon balance during the coming decades. This study presents a comprehensive European Union wide (EU15 plus Norway and Switzerland, EU*) assessment of potential future changes in terrestrial carbon storage considering these effects based on four illustrative IPCC-SRES storylines (A1FI, A2, B1, B2). A process-based land vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM), adapted to include a generic representation of managed ecosystems, is forced with changing fields of land-use patterns from 1901 to 2100 to assess the effect of land-use and cover changes on the terrestrial carbon balance of Europe. The uncertainty in the future carbon balance associated with the choice of a climate change scenario is assessed by forcing LPJ-DGVM with output from four different climate models (GCMs: CGCM2, CSIRO2, HadCM3, PCM2) for the same SRES storyline. Decrease in agricultural areas and afforestation leads to simulated carbon sequestration for all land-use change scenarios with an average net uptake of 17-38 Tg C/year between 1990 and 2100, corresponding to 1.9-2.9% of the EU*s CO2 emissions over the same period. Soil carbon losses resulting from climate warming reduce or even offset carbon sequestration resulting from growth enhancement induced by climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the second half of the twenty-first century. Differences in future climate change projections among GCMs are the main cause for uncertainty in the cumulative European terrestrial carbon uptake of 4.4-10.1 Pg C between 1990 and 2100.

AB  - To cope with the funding constraints of biodiversity protection, nature-based tourism, which is regarded as an important ecosystem service, is considered as an option for creating revenues for biodiversity conservation. Here we show that Finnish national parks (NPs) with high biodiversity values are more attractive for visitors than parks with lower biodiversity values, providing evidence on the direct linkage between biodiversity protection and the provisioning of ecosystem services in protected areas. We found that the number of visits NPs received annually, i.e., their attractiveness, was positively associated with the number of Natura2000 habitat types and occurrences of species considered threatened in Finland according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria. Interestingly, recreational use also overlapped spatially with areas containing high biodiversity values: the number of occurrences of threatened species and Natura2000 habitat types were on average higher close to recreational routes than among randomly picked control areas within NPs. Our results emphasise the need for careful planning and park management in protecting biodiversity in NPs. However, these connections between biodiversity and recreational use of NPs are striking examples of "biophilia", the human need for and love for nature, and can be used to engage the public more strongly with biodiversity issues.

AB  - The occurrence and habitat associations of the majority of invertebrate groups in boreal forests are poorly known, even though these groups represent perhaps over 99% of the animal species diversity in the forests. We studied the beetle (Coleoptera) fauna of four forest site types in northern Finland: in spruce mires, herb rich, mesic and sub-xeric forests. We sampled beetles in 32 study sites with five window and five pitfall traps in each. We describe the species abundance and diversity patterns within and among forest types and relate these patterns to structural components of the forests. The volume of decaying wood varied from 14 to 93 m(3) ha(-1) among sampling sites. The total beetle catch consisted of 100 333 individuals and 435 species. The beetle species richness did not vary according to site fertility but the number of specimens increased with increasing fertility in heath forest sites. The richness of beetle species correlated only weakly with any of the stand structure characteristics at the stand level. Nevertheless, the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicated that different beetle assemblages are characteristic of different forest types, The high level of beta-diversity in beetles among forest types indicates that focusing exclusively on, for example, key-biotopes (presumed biodiversity hotspots) when selecting areas to be set aside would result in a situation where a large proportion of species, even of the rare and threatened ones, is not included in this network of protected areas. This suggests that the complementary set or different forest types may be the best general strategy to maintain the overall beetle species diversity in boreal forests.

AB  - All countries in Scandinavia have introduced a carbon fee on fossil fuel to reduce the emission of the climate gas CO2. In Norway the fee is 0.82 NOK (or about 0.12 US$) per liter of gasoline, equivalent to 343 NOK (or 49 US$) per ton CO2. The fee is an emission cost which gives a corresponding benefit for absorbing atmospheric CO2 in forest biomass. This article shows that this benefit corresponds to a net economic value of carbon sequestration in forest biomass 2-30 times higher than the net value of timber as raw material for the forest industry in Norway, which has one of the highest timber prices in the world. If a fee high enough to stabilize the CO2 emission in Norway were to be introduced, the value of carbon sequestration will be at least twice as high as the above estimates. It is argued that this will imply substantial changes in forest management and policy, both in rich and poor countries. Projects to restore and maintain sustainable forest ecosystems will be very profitable, and could simultaneously provide considerable other environmental benefits like increased biodiversity, soil stability, and improved watershed structures.

AB  - Broad-scale estimates of coarse woody debris (CWD) yield across landscapes are somewhat rare, despite the importance of CWD in ecosystem functioning and its potential role in terrestrial carbon cycles. Yields of CWD were estimated at regional scales by linking a stand-level predictive model with regional forest inventory data for 11 states in the southern United States. We estimated that the accumulation of CWD in late-rotation loblolly pine plantations across the South totals 48.67 million metric tons of dry wood necromass, the carbon equivalent of 24.33 million metric tons. This represents annual CO2 emissions of 21 coal-fired power plants, or the amount of carbon sequestered each year in 7 million ha of pine forests. Confidence intervals for CWD dry weight per hectare generally did not exceed +/- 25% of the estimated values. Although county-level estimates were of higher uncertainty, the spatial pattern appeared to be relatively consistent with the extent of loblolly pine, with low yields near the extremes of the species' natural range and high yields in extensively forested portions of its range. Quantifying regional carbon stores of CWD with respect to stand-level management activities may improve accuracy of regional estimates and provide further insight into management effects on the carbon pool and the carbon cycle.

AB  - Continuous cover forestry (CCF) has proven to financially outperform rotation forestry (RF) with low or even moderate social price of carbon in mineral soils. However, to date there are no studies to compare financial performance of joint production (timber and carbon sequestration) between mineral soils and peatlands when CCF is applied. A vast variety of harvest intervals and intensity (expressed as post-harvest basal area) for a mature spruce-dominated [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] stand on both mineral and peat soils was simulated with process-based ecosystem model, EFIMOD. In addition, four levels of carbon price (0, 25, 50 and 75euro/tCO(2)) were applied in assessing the profitability of joint production (timber and carbon sequestration) associated with CCF. Mineral soil turned out to be superior to peatland in cost-efficiency of carbon sequestration. For instance, the cost of additional ton of CO2 was only euro2/tCO(2) with a carbon price of euro25/tCO(2) for a private forest owner (through carbon trading), while on peatland it fluctuated between euro30 and euro39.5/tCO(2), depending on the carbon price applied for a private forest owner (euro25-euro75/tCO(2)). In general, mineral soil was more sensitive to harvest interval and intensity than peatland, with respect to cost-efficiency in climate change mitigation.

AB  - The mycetophilid fauna and environmental variables were studied at 15 sites within a spruce forest in southern Norway. There were five replications of each of the following categories: semi-natural forests, clearcuts, and managed forests (clearcut 70-120 years ago). Clearcutting seems to induce a long lasting effect on the Mycetophilidae fauna. The semi-natural forests were more species-rich and contained more 'potentially rare' species than the two other categories. Even though managed forests and clearcuts differed in faunal composition, their species richness was not significantly different. Continuity is probably a main factor for maintaining the diversity of Mycetophilidae species. Lumping the 15 sites together, the number of species was strongly correlated with the (temporal) continuity of tree cover and substrates, which may reflect an increased diversity of fungal habitats both in dead wood and on the ground. The degree of continuity was recognized by means of indicator species of fungi, lichen and vascular plants. The amount of dead wood was correlated with the species diversity, but was probably dependent on the continuity factor, since clearcuts with much dead wood had relatively fewer species.
   Important elements in a strategy for conservation of the diversity of mycetophilid species seem to be: (i) to identify and protect the remnant patches of forests with long continuity, (ii) as far as possible, to practice timber harvesting in earlier clearcut forests instead of semi-natural forests.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the understory vegetation in chronosequences representing seminatural and managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests on dryish heaths of the Vaccinium type. The data represent the middle boreal vegetation zone and were collected in eastern Finland and the Dvina area of Karelia, on both sides of the border between Finland and the Russian Federation. Species diversity and the coverage of the various life-form groups (ground lichens, mosses, liverworts, grasses, herbs, dwarf shrubs, and tree seedlings) were used to analyse the properties of the ground vegetation over the succession from open forest land to closed forest communities. The clearest differences in diversity between the seminatural forests mainly influenced by fire and managed forests occurred in the early stages of succession. Forest management appeared to increase the species richness at the beginning of succession. The seminatural stands were rich in Cladonia lichens and dwarf shrubs up until tree canopy closure; however, the abundance of mosses was lower in the seminatural stands. Forest management favoured an abundance of grasses, notably Deschampsia flexuosa, which was common after clear-cutting. The use of prescribed burning in silviculture could result in more natural vegetation succession dynamics in managed stands.

AB  - Background: The outbreaks of bluetongue and Schmallenberg disease in Europe have increased efforts to understand the ecology of Culicoides biting midges and their role in pathogen transmission. However, most studies have focused on a specific habitat, region, or country. To facilitate wider comparisons, and to obtain a better understanding of the spread of disease through Europe, the present study focused on monitoring biting midge species diversity in three different habitat types and three countries across Europe.
   Methods: Biting midges were trapped using Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute light traps at a total of 27 locations in Sweden, the Netherlands and Italy, comprising farm, peri-urban and wetland habitats. From July 2014 to June 2015 all locations were sampled monthly, except for during the winter months. Trapped midges were counted and identified morphologically. Indices on species richness, evenness and diversity were calculated. Community compositions were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) techniques.
   Results: A total of 50,085 female midges were trapped during 442 collection nights. More than 88% of these belonged to the Obsoletus group. The highest midge diversity was found in Sweden, while species richness was highest in the Netherlands, and most specimens were trapped in Italy. For habitats within countries, diversity of the trapped midges was lowest for farms in all countries. Differences in biting midge species communities were more distinct across the three countries than the three habitat types.
   Conclusions: A core midge community could be identified, in which the Obsoletus group was the most abundant. Variations in vector communities across countries imply different patterns of disease spread throughout Europe. How specific species and their associated communities affect disease risk is still unclear. Our results emphasize the importance of midge diversity data at community level, how this differs across large geographic range within Europe, and its implications on assessing risks of midge-borne disease outbreaks.

AB  - Types of ectomycorrhizae on Norway spruce have been studied in different forest ecosystems in Slovenia. In approximately 100.000 root tips sampled 29 types have been identified or comprehensively described by anatomical and molecular characteristics, 4 could be identified to the genus level, while more than 20 types still await comprehensive characterisation. From these data diversity indexes (species diversity (d) and Shannon-Weaver index of diversity (H)) were calculated. The highest diversity was found in an autochthonous altimontane spruce stand on Pokljuka, lower in anthropogenic montane spruce stands in Mislinja and Zavodnje, while the lowest diversity was found in anthropogenic altimontane spruce stands, overgrown by grasses, on Pohorje. Forestry practice and its consequences, such as compact grass undercover, has been suggested to have a great impact on biodiversity of the mycorrhizal component in the forest soils. We propose a hypothesis that in natural pure spruce stands an extreme diversity in the mycorrhizosphere of the forest soils can counterpart the lower diversity among the higher plants.

AB  - Agriculture is regarded as a net emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG), but sequesters huge amounts of carbon in soils, bioenergy substrates, and food products. The global accounting system for climate impact based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology only takes account of costs (emissions), and not income (carbon and energy binding), leading to the conclusion that agricultural activities should decrease to mitigate climate change. This study considered an alternative accounting system, carbon capture LCA (CC-LCA), that allocates value to carbon sequestration in agricultural products. For two case farms in Sweden (arable, dairy), CC-LCA was applied to (1) calculate the carbon footprint of agricultural production by accounting for net GHG emissions from farm production, rather than gross emissions only, and (2) assess the net impact of mineral nitrogen fertilizer. For the arable farm, CC-LCA revealed net carbon binding of 4 Mg CO2-eq per hectare (net sink), compared with emissions of 1.6 Mg CO2-eq per hectare in LCA. For the dairy farm, both approaches showed emissions of about 10 Mg CO2-eq per dairy cow, mainly due to ruminant digestion. The results also showed that mineral nitrogen fertilizer effectively contributed to carbon sequestration. Compared with an unfertilized wheat crop, a fertilizer dose of 200 kg N ha(-1) was estimated to bind about eight-fold more GHG and energy in grain than was released or used during fertilizer production and crop cultivation. Thus, we argue that future strategies aiming for climate-friendly products and practices must acknowledge that agriculture sequesters carbon in products.

AB  - Biomass and species diversity (richness and evenness) of littoral organisms were explored in 27 sites in three basins of the large Lake Saimaa system in eastern Finland. The basins differed in degree of nutrient loading and trophic status. Six organismal groups, i.e., phytoplankton, periphyton, macrophytes, crustacean zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were studied. Factors affecting the biomass and diversity of these groups were explored by multiple stepwise regression analysis. The biomass of different groups was explained by the same variables, mainly nutrients, while diversity was associated with different environmental factors among the studied groups. The biomass of periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish correlated significantly with each other. There was also an apparent association between the biomass of macrophytes and that of benthic invertebrates. However, no significant correlations were found among the diversity of the studied groups. In accordance with previous studies, our results did not support the existence of species-rich hotspots or the possibility of using any surrogate taxon to reveal overall biodiversity. Thus, for conservation planning, biological surveys should include extensive collection of taxonomic groups and organisms at all trophic levels.

AB  - AimMacroclimate is a major determinant of large-scale diversity patterns. However, the influence of smaller-scale factors on local diversity across large spatial extents is not well documented. Here, we quantify the relative importance of local (patch-scale), landscape-scale and macroclimatic drivers of herbaceous species diversity in small forest patches in agricultural landscapes across Europe.
   LocationDeciduous forest patches in eight regions along a macroclimatic gradient from southern France to central Sweden and Estonia.
   MethodsThe diversity of forest specialists and generalists at three levels (whole forest patch, sampling plots within patches and between scales) was related to patch-scale (forest area, age, abiotic and biotic heterogeneity), landscape-scale (amount of forest, grasslands and hedgerows around the patch, patch isolation) and macroclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation) using generalized linear mixed models and variation partitioning for each group of variables.
   ResultsThe total amount of explained variation in diversity ranged from 8% for plot-scale diversity of generalists to 54% for patch-scale diversity of forest specialists. Patch-scale variables always explained more than 60% of the explained variation in diversity, mainly due to the positive effect of within-patch heterogeneity on patch-scale and between-scale diversities and to the positive effect of patch age on plot-scale diversity of forest specialists. Landscape-scale variables mainly contributed to the amount of explained variation in plot-scale diversity, being more important for forest specialists (21%) than for generalists (18%). Macroclimatic variables contributed a maximum of 11% to the plot-scale diversity of generalists.
   Main conclusionsMacroclimate poorly predicts local diversity across Europe, and herbaceous diversity is mainly explained by habitat features, less so by landscape structure. We show the importance of conserving old forest patches as refugia for typical forest species, and of enhancing the landscape context around the patches by reducing the degree of disturbance caused by agriculture.

AB  - Rural industries in Norway are increasingly being marginalized, and rural populations are decreasing. Rural areas and the mountain landscapes which often characterize them are, however, highly valued for their biodiversity, and for amenity values, which in many cases are associated with national parks and other protected areas. In this context, the present study seeks to explore local stakeholders' views on issues associated with tourism development in Norwegian national parks - in particular, their personal interests, rural discourses and management planning processes. Four focus group meetings were undertaken in two prominent national parks in Norway, Rondane National Park and Jotunheimen National Park, and with two main user groups: traditional rural user interests and local tourism interests. Findings revealed strong support across all groups for the existence of the two national parks. Both groups in both parks were in favour of some level, and certain types, of tourism within the parks. The local tourism interests, however, felt more strongly than their counterparts that a more extensive tourism strategy was needed to support the local communities. A general frustration with the present management regime was noted among several stakeholders. A key conclusion is that local stakeholders should be significantly involved in future park management processes.

AB  - In the context of national park management, landscape conservation, and tourism development in a mountain region in Norway, the aim of the research is to analyse how tourists, residents, and local stakeholders experience and practise their participation in the landscapes. A mixed methods approach was used, which included focus group meetings, semi-structured interviews, an on-site survey, and two Internet surveys to gain in-depth knowledge of tourists??? and locals??? relations to and evaluations of the landscape in the studied national park region, which comprised the park itself and eight protected landscape areas. The results revealed that many of the tourists visiting the national park considered the area it covered was a wilderness, while locals considered the area???s authenticity was closely connected to cultural traditions and a long-lasting interconnectedness between people and landscape. As both locals and tourists shared a desire to maintain the wildlife and landscape char-acteristics of the national park, authenticity may serve as a common denominator for emphasizing local development, outdoor activities, and meeting points outside the boundary of the park. The authors conclude that involving tourists in a knowledge process that provides insights into the past and present livelihoods of com-munities and the use of the natural resources could help to enhance tourists??? experiences, but without compromising local understandings of authenticity.

KW  - PRESERVATION
AB  - Costs generated by nature conservation are repeatedly under discussion. Most often the costs of conservation are estimated as aggregate figures at the national or regional level or alternatively, for a forest owner. In this study they were examined at the local level, in the forestry dependent municipality of Ilomantsi in Eastern Finland. The estimations of lost net revenues (stumpage income less silvicultural costs), wages, entrepreneurial income and profits, employment and value added were based on alternative forest management plans calculated for conservation areas. The annual losses as regards employment during the first decade were estimated to be 5.7-20.4 jobs. Later, the employment effects were estimated to be 2.4-6.3 lost jobs. Although the value added lost during the first decade was estimated to be at maximum only 3.4% of the present total value added of the municipality, the share of the value added of forestry was estimated to be higher than the mere protected forest land share would indicate. The use of conservation areas for forestry would create a moderate increase of employment in forestry, i.e. 3.8-14%, during the first decade, but it would later stabilise at a much lower level. Employment impacts at the municipal level were estimated as very small (at maximum 0.9%), but on the other hand, for some villages even single jobs may matter. The main reasons for the minor impacts were the high mechanisation rate of logging and the major flow of stumpage income outside the locality.

AB  - Local tourism firms represent an important stakeholder interest in national parks. The present study examines these stakeholders' perceptions of management processes and their assessments of the resulting management plans and operations. This research is based on qualitative interviews with representatives of tourism businesses in two different national park settings in Norway - Rondane National Park and Jotunheimen National Park. The findings illustrate that despite their general support for the national park status, the local tourism stakeholders interviewed had experienced only minor involvement in the management planning process, and had had very little influence in the final management decisions. They believed that opportunities for business operations were lacking due to excessive management restrictions, and that managers lacked competence with regard to business management and tourism development issues. In addition, they thought that management authorities should more explicitly include sustainable tourism development in their visions and goals. Based on the findings, it is assumed that there is potential for local tourism operators to take greater responsibility in planning processes and management operations. It is concluded that measures should be taken to foster durable social links and trustworthy planning partnerships between responsible managers and local tourism stakeholders in the two national parks.

AB  - Provision of forest ecosystem services is influenced by site and stand characteristics as well as forest management practices. In order to evaluate the influence of forest management on ecosystem services provision, two artificial black pine forests located in Central Italy were studied where two different thinning approaches (traditional and selective) were applied under the SelPiBio LIFE project. Four main ecosystem services were selected and assessed: timber and bioenergy production, carbon sequestration, forest stand stability-protection, and biodiversity conservation. Even if not supported by statistical evidence, results highlighted an interesting trend just 2 years after treatment. The selective thinning was able to enhance the majority of ecosystem services compared to the traditional one. A higher growth rate of selected crop trees was measured (i.e., carbon sequestration). The slenderness ratio was sensibly reduced (i.e., mechanical stability) with a positive implication on soil retention and the prevention of landslides. Moreover, valuable and interesting commercial assortments have been proven to be retrieved from the stands with the selective approach. Larger and also better formed trees were harvested, given the impact of selective thinning on the co-dominant class. The Shannon index increased only with the selective thinning intervention. In conclusion, the provided results and methods are encouraging and might represent the basis for novel and longer monitoring efforts.

AB  - Our study focused on a postdisturbance area that arose after the large-scale windstorm on 19 November 2004 in Tatra National Park, northern Slovakia. The wind destroyed forest stands dominated by Norway spruce at elevations from 700 to 1400 m above sea level. The windstorm dramatically changed the forest stands in the national park, motivating our research teams to study postdisturbance tree cover dynamics. We quantified tree species composition (diversity) and carbon pool in whole-tree biomass of young forest stands after the disturbance, in 2007, 2010, and 2016. The number of tree species was significantly greater at lower (below 900 m; foothill sites) than higher elevations (above 900 m; mountain sites). The number of species increased between 2007 and 2010, and after 2010 almost stabilized. In 2007, estimates showed an average of 1.9 tons of carbon per hectare in the lower sites and only 0.4 tons in higher sites. Between 2007 and 2016, carbon stocks in whole-tree biomass grew to 11.5 t ha(-1) in lower sites and 5.3 t ha(-1) in higher ones, with an average for the entire area of about 8 t ha(-1). Estimates showed that the carbon stock in whole-tree biomass before the calamity (in 1996) was 101 t ha(-1). After the wind disturbance, higher biomass stock was found among conifers (especially Norway spruce) at lower elevations and among broadleaves (mostly birch) at higher elevations. We found that tree species composition after the wind disturbance was more diverse than that before forest destruction. The current tree species composition seems to be a positive consequence of disturbance, especially given the species composition's resistance to harmful agents, including wind and bark beetles.

AB  - Visitors' assessments of the negative impact of tourism, on physical and social environment, vary based on the location where the evaluation occurs. Research that focuses on identifying visitors' norms within outdoor recreation settings has not been able to link the geographical location with the corresponding evaluation of unacceptable levels of impact. This study combines a traditional on-site visitor survey with a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems survey to produce spatially explicit information on visitors' acceptance of tourism impacts. Using a web-based participatory survey, visitors were asked to indicate specific locations where they felt the effects of tourism disturbed the quality of their experience in Oulanka National Park. These evaluations were analyzed at multiple scales - destination, specific zones, and sites - to promote more efficient park management. Based on visitor evaluations, we found a collection of hotspots in the park where tourism has already caused unacceptable impacts. Visitors noted that crowding and erosion disturbed their experiences, especially along highly visited trail sections, while littering was considered problematic near wilderness huts. However, participant satisfaction at these sites was not lower than elsewhere in the park. This indicates that the association between negative impacts of tourism and visitor satisfaction is not straightforward, but complex. This study encourages the collection of spatially accurate data on visitors' assessments of the effects of tourism because it has the potential to more efficiently direct park management policies. In addition, spatial techniques provide a new means to monitor the impacts of tourism, acknowledging that visitors' perceptions of acceptability of tourism impacts also vary within tourism destinations, such as parks.

AB  - We assessed the net carbon (C) sequestration dynamics of street tree plantings based on 10 years of measurements at two case study sites each with different tree species in Helsinki, Finland. We assessed C loss from tree soils and tree C accumulation, tested the applicability of pre-existing growth and biomass equations against observations, and estimated the time point for the beginning of net C sequestration for the studied street tree plantings. The tree woody biomass C accumulation in the first 10 years after planting was 18-32 kg per tree. At the same time the C loss from the growth media was at least 170 kg per growth media volume (25 m(3)) per tree. If this soil C loss was accounted for, the net C sequestration would begin, at best, approximately 30 years after planting. Biomass equations developed for traditional forests predicted more stem biomass and less leaf and branch biomass than measured for the species examined, but total aboveground biomass was generally well predicted.

AB  - To evaluate factors influencing a suburban bird community in coastal northern California, we examined the abundance, richness, and diversity of wintering birds at 75 locations within the city of Arcata. For each location we used aerial imagery to determine the proportions of vegetation and impervious surfaces within 75 m and the distances to various landscape features. Human activity was measured and used as a covariate in model selection. Total bird abundance, species richness, and diversity declined with the proportion of road surface at a site, while the abundance of non-native species increased with the cover of roads and structures. The proportions of shrub and tree cover at a site predicted total abundance and richness positively. The effect of trees on species diversity was increasingly positive in more urban areas. Several species, such as Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Wrentit (Chamaea fasciata), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), and Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), were positively associated with tall vegetation and negatively associated with road and structure cover. The White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus) was positively correlated with grass and trees and negatively correlated with road and structure cover. These species may be the most vulnerable to the habitat changes associated with urbanization in this study area. We recommend maintaining/restoring native shrubs and or trees to enhance bird communities in developed areas or to improve planning where development is inevitable. Increasing shrub and tree cover may be especially valuable in newer neighborhoods and far from forest edges.

AB  - Biotic and abiotic carbon sequestration currently seems to be the only viable tools at the disposal of mankind for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus a remedy for tackling global warming challenges. This study accesses the global carbon capture and storage (CCS) programme: the level of success in its implementation and its impact using panel data from eight countries, the majority of which have begun one or more operational CCS facilities. To achieve this objective, fifteen years period time series data was sourced for the eight selected countries based on data availability, namely the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Australia, Norway, South Africa, and Nigeria; ranging from 1990 to 2015. The panel ARDL results show that the explanatory variables, global industrial production (LIP), Electricity production (LEP), Agricultural production (LAP), transportation (LTR), and energy supply (LES) have a long-run relationship with the dependent variable (LGHG emissions). While the short-run results show that none of the variables have a significant contribution to LGHG emissions. In the long-run results, LIP and LTR significantly contribute to the reduction of LGHG courtesy of the CCS programme while LEP, LAP, and LES contribute to a rise in the LGHG emission. The cross-sectional results show that all the variables have significant impacts on LGHG in all the sampled countries except Australia. Suggesting that, the CCS programme is viable for mitigating global warming and climate change and therefore should be considered by the various countries of the world.

AB  - There is an increasing focus on ecosystem services provided by macroalgae worldwide, many which depend on its structural and morphological characteristics. Here we investigated how characteristics of canopy kelp plants of Laminaria hyperborea varies along the Norwegian part of the NE Atlantic. Ten characteristics related to size, allometry, density, biomass and epiphytes were analyzed along wide gradients of depth, wave exposure and latitude. The analyses were performed on a compiled dataset of 630 scuba samples from different research and monitoring projects along the Norwegian coast (58-71 degrees N). The largest kelps, highest biomass, and highest biomass of epiphytic algae was found in Mid-Norway (63-65 degrees N). While most size-related kelp characteristics were reduced with water depth, they were enlarged with wave exposure. The developed statistical models can be used to calculate site-specific values (and their variation) of the different characteristics at any location based on latitude, depth and wave exposure. These can further be used to map kelp derived ecosystem services. We predicted region-specific estimates of total plant weight, kelp density and kelp biomass. Moreover, the models were applied to estimate living biomass (56 million tonnes fresh weight), carbon standing stock (2.6 million tonnes carbon or 9.5 million tonnes CO2), and carbon sequestration potential (0.46 million tonnes per year) for the Norwegian kelp forests, that were estimated to cover about 5 355 km(2). The site- and region-specific estimates are relevant to kelp forest management and for blue carbon accountings.

AB  - Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning.

AB  - A methodological approach to the identification of biodiversity indicators in commercial forest stands is illustrated by analysis of the relationships between syrphid (hoverflies) and carabid (ground beetles) community composition and diversity, and stand structure and field layer vegetation. Data were collected from 12 commercial forest sites encompassing a range of climatic conditions and different crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine) across the UK. Comparisons were also made between unmanaged semi-natural Scots pine woods and Scots pine plantations. For both syrphids and carabids, no differences in species richness and diversity were recorded between semi-natural stands and plantations; one rare syrphid considered to be restricted to semi-natural pine stands was also found in spruce. Syrphid species diversity and richness was higher in southern spruce sites than in the northern sites. Northern sites had distinctive carabid communities, as did sites in the New Forest, a large ancient woodland in southern England. Of the measured habitat variables, vertical stand structure showed the best correlation with species richness and diversity of both carabids and syrphids. Richness and diversity were less in stands with high vertical cover values for canopy layers. Stands with higher field layer cover supported greater syrphid diversity, but lower carabid diversity. Measures of stand structure could be used as potential indicators of syrphid and carabid diversity, but additional habitat parameters also need to be tested.

AB  - Carbon storage by mineralisation (CSM) is an option for CO2 emissions mitigation that has been under intensive study at Abo Akademi (AA), Finland. Magnesium from silicate rocks is extracted with recoverable ammonium salts at 250-500 degrees C. The extracted elements are separated by selective precipitation and Mg is subsequently carbonated in a pressurised fluidised bed. This work studies the applicability of the process for co-extraction of Ni, Cu, Fe and Mg from nickel ore and nickel mine waste rock (overburden). The rock samples were collected from the Hitura Nickel mine, Finland. The results show that it is possible to co-extract the listed elements and integrate CSM (by the AA process) with steelmaking and Ni production industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The gradually decreasing connectivity of habitats threatens biodiversity and ecological processes valuable to humans. Green infrastructure is promoted by the European Commission as a key instrument for the conservation of ecosystems in the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020. Green infrastructure has been defined as a network of natural and semi-natural areas, designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. We surveyed Finnish experts' perceptions on the development of green infrastructure within the existing policy framework. Our results show that improving the implementation of existing conservation policy instruments needs to be an integral part of developing green infrastructure. Despite the potential of green infrastructure to benefit biodiversity, existing conceptual ambiguity of green infrastructure with rather complex role of ecosystem services - and the possible interpretation of this in practice - raises concerns regarding its ability to contribute to biodiversity conservation.

AB  - A necessary reduction in climate impact and raised interest in the self-sufficiency of food in Sweden serve as the major background for the study. The purpose was to examine whether conversion of Swedish agriculture following principles of Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) could be a realistic alternative. Case studies of 22 ERA farms were performed, and results were presented for five production groups in kg production, carbon sequestration, and nutrient balance per hectare. The farms show climate impact substantially lower than Swedish average agriculture, through 85% lower commodity purchases and 2.3 times larger carbon sequestration due to more ley cropping. Target diets with varying amounts of meat and dairy products were defined and matched with the production and presented in scenarios where the farms' staple food production is upscaled for a Swedish population of 11 million inhabitants. Results are presented in kg of food category produced, hectares of arable land, CO2 equivalents, and kg of N surplus per capita. The scenario results show that it is possible to achieve at least a 90% decrease in climate impact. It is concluded that it is within range for Sweden to be self-sufficient in staple foods based on the available acreage of arable land by adopting Ecological Recycling Agricultural principles in a similar manner as the studied farms.

AB  - The annual growth rates in Swedish forests are higher than the annual harvest rates, and this has resulted in high rates of carbon sequestration in the Swedish forestry sector. Any factor that tends to reduce growth rates also has the potential to reduce forest carbon sequestration rates, and ozone may be one such factor. The aim of this study was to estimate to what extent the occurrence of elevated tropospheric ozone concentrations can negatively affect carbon sequestration by Swedish forest ecosystems. The net primary production (NPP) of Swedish forests was simulated, using the 3-PG model, for representative forest stands in six different geographical zones across Sweden, with and without assumed negative impacts of ozone. Ozone impacts were derived from dose-response relationships, calculated from open-top chamber experiments with young trees. The results of the 3-PG simulations showed that the NPP was generally higher in the A2 and B2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) future climate scenarios, as compared to the current climate, for all tree species and in all geographical zones across Sweden. Biomass production was reduced by 4.3-15.5% for conifers (Norway spruce (Picea abies L) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) and by 1.4-4.3% for birch (Beta la pendula Roth and Beta la pubescence Ehrh) under ambient ozone conditions as compared to the preindustrial ozone level. The greatest reduction in biomass was found in southern Sweden. Biomass was reduced by similar percentage value in future climate scenarios as that in the current climate.

AB  - Human recognition, valuation, and communication lie at the heart of ecosystem goods and services. We explore how the wellbeing effects of ecosystems are recognized and communicated based on data obtained from an information campaign to increase public awareness of the health and wellbeing benefits of rural nature areas in Finland. Interested members of the public from different backgrounds were asked to outline and publicly share short descriptions of their personal recommendations for improving their wellbeing through interacting with rural landscapes. The results indicate that a wide variety of ecosystem types and functions are perceived to be important for producing a range of wellbeing benefits through experiencing and multisensory observations of natural landscapes. The importance of cultural and experiential ecosystem services were highlighted while provisioning services received only minor attention, and regulating services were almost entirely unnoted.

AB  - Environmental gradients are caused by gradual changes in abiotic factors, which affect species abundances and distributions, and are important for the spatial distribution of biodiversity. One prominent environmental gradient is the altitude gradient. Understanding ecological processes associated with altitude gradients may help us to understand the possible effects climate change could have on species communities. We quantified vegetation cover, species richness, species evenness, beta diversity, and spatial patterns of community structure of vascular plants along altitude gradients in a subarctic mountain tundra in northern Sweden. Vascular plant cover and plant species richness showed unimodal relationships with altitude. However, species evenness did not change with altitude, suggesting that no individual species became dominant when species richness declined. Beta diversity also showed a unimodal relationship with altitude, but only for an intermediate spatial scale of 1km. A lack of relationships with altitude for either patch or landscape scales suggests that any altitude effects on plant spatial heterogeneity occurred on scales larger than individual patches but were not effective across the whole landscape. We observed both nested and modular patterns of community structures, but only the modular patterns corresponded with altitude. Our observations point to biotic regulations of plant communities at high altitudes, but we found both scale dependencies and inconsistent magnitude of the effects of altitude on different diversity components. We urge for further studies evaluating how different factors influence plant communities in high altitude and high latitude environments, as well as studies identifying scale and context dependencies in any such influences.

AB  - European forests are intensively exploited for wood products, yet they also form a sink for carbon. European forest inventories, available for the past 50 years, can be combined with timber harvest statistics to assess changes in this carbon sink. Analysis of these data sets between 1950 and 2000 from the EU-15 countries excluding Luxembourg, plus Norway and Switzerland, reveals that there is a tight relationship between increases in forest biomass and forest ecosystem productivity but timber harvests grew more slowly. Encouragingly, the environmental conditions in combination with the type of silviculture that has been developed over the past 50 years can efficiently sequester carbon on timescales of decades, while maintaining forests that meet the demand for wood. However, a return to using wood as biofuel and hence shorter rotations in forestry could cancel out the benefits of carbon storage over the past five decades.

AB  - The indirect effect of moose Alces alces browsing on ground beetle's abundance and diversity was investigated by pitfall trapping in a mixed coniferous forest in Vestfold County (59 degrees 19' N, 9 degrees 50' E, Norway), during the summer of 2002. Three areas with different browsing pressures, ranging from non- to medium- and heavily browsed were chosen and dry weight of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and humidity at ground level were measured in the three locations. As predicted, the gradient analyses showed that browsing by moose influenced the composition of carabid fauna, and that browsing intensity and humidity covaried with the most important gradient in carabid species composition found across the three locations. Species that live in light stands with rather dry soil, were more often captured in the browsed areas, whereas shade tolerant and hygrophilous species were more abundant in the non-browsed area. The carabid abundance increased significantly with increasing browsing pressure. According to our predictions, the diversity at trap level (alpha-diversity) was higher in the highly browsed area. Conversely, species turnover (beta-diversity) decreased with browsing intensity. On the other hand, the rarefaction analysis showed that the regional species richness (gamma-diversity) was considerably higher in the medium browsed area than in the heavily browsed one, which is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. This study indicates that moose, by reducing the bilberry that constitutes the field layer in summer, affect carabid species composition and might be capable to reshape the whole ecosystem in our study area by a cascade effect.

AB  - Given the significance of national carbon inventories, the importance of large-scale estimates of carbon stocks is increasing. Accurate biomass estimates are essential for tracking changes in the carbon stock through repeated assessment of carbon stock, widely used for both vegetation and soil, to estimate carbon sequestration. Objectives: The aim of our study was to determine the variability of several aspects of the carbon stock value when the input matrix was (1) expressed either as a vector or as a raster; (2) expressed as in local (1:10,000) or regional (1:100,000) scale data; and (3) rasterized with different pixel sizes of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 m. Method: The look-up table method, where expert carbon content values are attached to the mapped landscape matrix. Results: Different formats of input matrix did not show fundamental differences with exceptions of the biggest raster of size 1000 m for the local level. At the regional level, no differences were notable. Conclusions: The results contribute to the specification of best practices for the evaluation of carbon storage as a mitigation measure, as well as the implementation of national carbon inventories.

AB  - Following the repeal in 1962 of a long-standing ban on trawling, yields of demersal fish from the Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, increased to a maximum in 1973 and then declined until the directed fishery effectively ceased in the early 2000s. Since then, the only landings of demersal fish from the Firth have been by-catch in the Norway lobster fishery. We analysed changes in biomass density, species diversity and length structure of the demersal fish community between 1927 and 2009 from scientific trawl surveys, and related these to the fishery harvesting rate. As yields collapsed, the community transformed from a state in which biomass was distributed across numerous species (high species evenness) and large maximum length taxa were common, to one in which 90 per cent of the biomass was vested in one species (whiting), and both large individuals and large maximum length species were rare. Species evenness recovered quickly once the directed fishery ceased, but 10 years later, the community was still deficient in large individuals. The changes partly reflected events at a larger regional scale but were more extreme. The lag in response with respect to fishing has implications for attempts at managing a restoration of the ecosystem.

AB  - Domestic livestock drives ecosystem changes in many of the world's mountain regions, and can be the dominant influence on soil, habitat and wildlife dynamics. Grazing impacts on ecosystem services (ES) vary according to densities of sheep, but an ES framework accounting for these is lacking. We devised an experiment to evaluate synergies and trade-offs of ESs and components of biodiversity affected by sheep density at the alpine landscape scale in southern Norway. We examined the effects of increased (80 per km(2)), decreased (0 per km(2)) and maintained sheep densities (25 per km(2)) on 'supporting', 'regulating' and 'provisioning' services and biodiversity (plants, invertebrates and birds). Overall, I and biodiversity were highest at maintained sheep density. Regulating services, including carbon storage and habitat openness, were particularly favoured by maintained densities of sheep. There was no overall decline in ESs from maintained to increased sheep densities, but several services, such as runoff water quality, plant productivity and carbon storage, declined when grazing increased. Our study provides experimental evidence for a positive effect of grazing on ES, but only at maintained low sheep densities. By identifying ES and biodiversity components that are traded-off at decreased and increased grazing, our study also demonstrates some of the negative impacts on ecosystems that can occur in mountain regions if management does not regulate herbivore densities.

AB  - Currently, the temperate forest biome cools the earth's climate and dampens anthropogenic climate change. However, climate change will substantially alter forest dynamics in the future, affecting the climate regulation function of forests. Increasing natural disturbances can reduce carbon uptake and evaporative cooling, but at the same time increase the albedo of a landscape. Simultaneous changes in vegetation composition can mitigate disturbance impacts, but also influence climate regulation directly (e.g., via albedo changes). As a result of a number of interactive drivers (changes in climate, vegetation, and disturbance) and their simultaneous effects on climate-relevant processes (carbon exchange, albedo, latent heat flux) the future climate regulation function of forests remains highly uncertain. Here we address these complex interactions to assess the effect of future forest dynamics on the climate system. Our specific objectives were (1) to investigate the long-term interactions between changing vegetation composition and disturbance regimes under climate change, (2) to quantify the response of climate regulation to changes in forest dynamics, and (3) to identify the main drivers of the future influence of forests on the climate system. We investigated these issues using the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model (iLand). Simulations were run over 200yr for Kalkalpen National Park (Austria), assuming different future climate projections, and incorporating dynamically responding wind and bark beetle disturbances. To consistently assess the net effect on climate the simulated responses of carbon exchange, albedo, and latent heat flux were expressed as contributions to radiative forcing. We found that climate change increased disturbances (+27.7% over 200yr) and specifically bark beetle activity during the 21st century. However, negative feedbacks from a simultaneously changing tree species composition (+28.0% broadleaved species) decreased disturbance activity in the long run (-10.1%), mainly by reducing the host trees available for bark beetles. Climate change and the resulting future forest dynamics significantly reduced the climate regulation function of the landscape, increasing radiative forcing by up to +10.2% on average over 200yr. Overall, radiative forcing was most strongly driven by carbon exchange. We conclude that future changes in forest dynamics can cause amplifying climate feedbacks from temperate forest ecosystems.

AB  - This paper examined vascular-plant and cryptogam species diversity on different spatial scales in semi-natural grasslands along an elevational gradient ranging from 530 m a.s.l. (southern boreal region) to 1230 m a.s.l. (low alpine region) in Vang, southern Norway. Species diversity of vascular-plants on a small scale (0.25 m(2)) peaked at mid-elevations. Diversity at low elevations was not higher than that of high elevations, but diversity on a large scale decreased continuously with elevation. Cryptogam diversity increased with elevation on all scales. High small-scale vascular-plant diversity at high elevations was positively related to species abundance which increased with elevation, and suggests an area effect along the gradient. Most species at mid-elevational levels (750 and 915 m a.s.l.) did also occur at other levels. Lowland vascular-plant species constituted 50% of the species in the low alpine region. Collectively, these patterns reflect the importance of regional dynamics along the gradient. Environmental variables such as topography, biomass, soil variables were less important for explaining variation in vascular plant diversity, and it is suggested that land-use processes such as grazing, mowing, fuel-wood cutting have levelled out the effects of other variables along the gradient.

AB  - It was found that diversity of spiders in Kolyma River delta (68.66o-69.25oN), located in the southern tundra, is about the same as in four other well studied local spider faunas located above the Polar Circle in boreal and tundra zones. But three families, Gnaphosidae, Philodromidae and Salticidae, have higher species diversity in the Kolyma River delta than in other local faunas of the boreal and tundra zones. To understand reasons for this phenomenon, we compared zoogeographical aspects of spiders from Northeastern Siberia and Finland and analyzed climate and microcli-mates indicators in five localities. Most likely the high-est species diversity of named families in the tundra zone and even highest diversity among all local faunas lying north of Polar Circle can be explained by a com-bination of two major factors: history and microcli-mate. The Kolyma River delta was never covered by the ice shield like other compared areas; and its high climate continentality led to a higher heat supply of the soil surface in the warmest habitats.

AB  - Ecosystem stores of carbon are a key component in the global carbon cycle. Many studies have examined the impact of climate change on ecosystem carbon storage, but few have investigated the impact of land-use change and herbivory. However, land-use change is a major aspect of environmental change, and livestock grazing is the most extensive land use globally. In this study, we combine a grazing exclosure experiment and a natural experiment to test the impact of grazer exclusion on vegetation dynamics and ecosystem carbon stores in the short term (12-year exclosures), and the long term (islands inaccessible to livestock), in a heavily grazed mountain region in Norway. Following long-term absence of sheep, birch forest was present. The grazing-resistant grass Nardus stricta, dominated under long-term grazing, whilst the selected grass Deschampsia flexuosa and herb species dominated the vegetation layer in the long-term absence of sheep. The established birch forest led to vegetation carbon stocks being higher on the islands (0.56 kg C m(-2) on the islands compared to 0.18 kg C m(-2) where grazed) and no difference in soil carbon stocks. In the short-term exclusion of sheep, there were minor differences in carbon stocks reflecting the longer term changes. These results show that aboveground carbon stocks are higher in the long-term absence of sheep than in the continual presence of high sheep densities, associated with a vegetation state change between tundra and forest. The reduction of herbivore populations can facilitate forest establishment and increase aboveground carbon stocks, however, the sequestration rate is low.

AB  - Context Biomass prediction is important when dealing for instance with carbon sequestration, wildfire modeling, or bioenergy supply. Although allometric models based on destructive sampling provide accurate estimates, alternative species-specific equations often yield considerably different biomass predictions. An important source of intra-specific variability remains unexplained.
   Aims The aims of the study were to inspect and assess intra-specific differences in aboveground biomass of Pinus brutia Ten. and to fill the gap in knowledge on biomass prediction for this species.
   Methods Two hundred one trees between 2.3 and 55.8 cm in diameter at breast height were sampled throughout the eastern- and southernmost natural distribution area of P. brutia, in Middle East, where it forms different stand structures. Allometric equations were fitted separately for two countries. The differences in biomass prediction at tree, stand, and forest level were analyzed. The effect of stand structure and past forest management was discussed.
   Results Between-country differences in total aboveground biomass were not large. However, differences in biomass stock were large when tree components were analyzed separately. Trees had higher stem biomass and lower crown biomass in dense even-aged stands than in more uneven-aged and sparse stands.
   Conclusion Biomass and carbon predictions could be improved by taking into account stand structure in biomass models.

AB  - The increasing numbers of tourists visiting national parks contribute to new opportunities as well as challenges. Alpine and Arctic national parks in Northern Europe are key habitats for vulnerable species such as wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), and there is a significant need for management tools that can reduce the negative impacts of tourism. To gain knowledge about visitors' motivations and spatial preferences, we carried out a survey of people (n = 498) on paths in part of Rondane National Park, Norway. The results indicate that a large share of the visitors in the central, vulnerable part of the National Park may find their desired recreational benefits in the less vulnerable fringe entrance areas. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the results and how to increase knowledge about visitors' spatial preferences in order better to regulate their behaviour with the aim of reducing impacts on vulnerable fauna.

AB  - Tourism in national parks is on the rise and contributes to shaping notions of the non-human world (often depicted as 'nature'). One country that is currently facing a shift towards an enhanced emphasis on tourism in its national parks is Sweden. This article aims to unravel, illuminate, and problematize ways of seeing the non-human world in tourists' Instagram posts about Swedish national parks, and also to consider the productive effects these might have on the relationship between humans and the non-human world. In a discursive and visual cultural analysis, representations of the non-human world, how they are situated in historically inherited ways of seeing, and what implications they might have for how humans approach and understand the non-human world are traced and reflected upon. These representations construct ways of seeing the non-human world as a sublime, desolate, and physically challenging treasury of unique character. In this way, a romantic tourist gaze is constructed, which approaches the national parks as isolated enclaves and commodified havens that offer tourists an escape from humanity, grand views, and seclusion. The main implication of this tourist gaze is a sustaining of the approach to the human world and the non-human world as separated.

AB  - This study describes differences in species richness, diversity and composition of Carabidae in gradients from recently abandoned, non-grazed fields over stages of overgrowth into forest on formerly agricultural land in a large, sandy outwash plain, south Sweden. Totally 80 pitfall traps, (4 succession stages, each represented by 4 sites; 5 traps per site) installed on 29 March 2006 were emptied continuously until 1 November. Succession stages were: 7-10 y old fallows after cereals with thin and low vegetation of small perennial and annual herbs (Ia), 7-10 y old fallows abandoned as lay with a rich plant cover of broad-leaved grasses and herbs (Ib), 20-25 y old fallows with a shrub layer of colonising pine and narrow-leaved grasses (II), and ca 80 y old pine stands planted on originally cultivated ground with a rich shrub layer but lacking herbaceous plants (III). A total of 14,068 individuals of 71 carabid species were captured. Species richness was highest in stage Ib, whereas Shannon species diversity was highest in Ia. Both species richness and diversity were lowest in III, sites II being intermediate. Total number of individuals captured site(-1)s was low in III, being highest in Ib. Mean body weight and total dry mass of species, however, increased with succession stage. Amara and Harpalus species were most common in Ia but important also in Ib, with large differences in species composition between the two stages. These genera were almost lacking in III, where Carabus spp. and Pterostichus niger dominated. The share of Calathus was highest in II, where C. fuscipes played a dominating role. P. versicolor dominated in Ib, whereas P. lepidus was quite common in all non-forest stages. Duration and intensity of capturing activity necessary to find most species of the sites are discussed. Many scarce or rare species in south Scandinavia were captured, mainly in Ib. Abandoned non-grazed fields are important hibernating and breeding refuges for many carabids. Using extensive and non-expensive management this ought to be considered as an additional alternative in environment conservation policy, which now usually recommends economically subsidised grazing on set-aside land.

AB  - This paper is the outcome of a group discussion held at the Savonlinna meeting 'Management of forest ecosystems and its impact on the GHG budget'. The aim of this break-out group discussion was to 'Characterize forest management impacts on the GHG budget of forest ecosystems in different European regions'. In this paper we briefly characterize different options that a forest owner has in order to maintain or maximize forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration. These hectare scale descriptions of measures are then regarded in connection to the current state of European forests and how they can be combined with ongoing management trends and local issues. We point out the various possibilities that exist in European forests, where they are located, and where they could possibly be combined with adaptation. We identify these hotspots for largest growing stocks, largest peat areas, and, e.g. largest risks for loss of carbon due to fire or urban sprawl. We conclude that one common strategy cannot be designed. Within each region, local solutions have to be found that optimize goals and aim at integrated and sustainable land use.

AB  - The increasing demand for biofuel may decrease the dead wood supply in managed forests, and hence the amount of substrate available for dead wood dependent species. Slash is already being harvested for biofuel purposes, and stumps are an even bigger potential source of wood fuel. Both substrates constitute a major component of dead wood in man aged forests, but have been poorly studied in terms of lichen diversity. We compared lichen species diversity between the lateral surface of slash and the cut surface of stumps of Norway spruce in planted boreonemoral Swedish forests of four age classes; 4 - 5, 8 - 9, 12 - 13, and 16 - 18 years. We also estimated the amounts of the two substrates, and discriminated between slash with bark and decorticated slash. There were no differences in species num ber per surface area, but slash had more species when equal volumes were compared. We found compositional differences between slash and stumps throughout the decay process. The majority of species found on both substrates were more frequent on stumps, which also had a higher number of unique species and species in the literature indicated as nationally rare or uncommon. The volume per hectare of stumps was ten times greater than that of slash but conversely, the lateral surface area of slash was five times greater than the cut surface area of stumps. Few dead wood specialist lichen species were, however, strictly associated with slash, whereas stumps offer a more heterogeneous environment and may provide important habitats for rare lichens in the managed forest landscape.

AB  - Norwegian funded REDD+ projects in Tanzania have attracted a lot of attention, as has the wider REDD+ policy that aims to reduce deforestation and degradation and enhance carbon storage in forests of the developing countries. One of these REDD+ projects, managed by WWF Tanzania, was criticised in a scientific paper published in GEC, and consequently in the global media, for being linked to attempted evictions of communities living in the Rufiji delta mangroves by the Government of Tanzania, allegedly to make the area 'ready for REDD'. In this response, we show how this eviction event in Rufiji mangroves has a history stretching back over 100 years, has nothing to do with REDD+ or any policy changes by government, and is not in any way linked to the work of any WWF project in Tanzania. We also outline some of the broader challenges faced by REDD+ in Tanzania. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Capture and subsurface storage of CO2 is widely viewed as being a necessary component of any strategy to minimise and control the continued increase in average global temperatures. Existing oil and gas reservoirs can be re-used for carbon storage, providing a substantial fraction of the vast amounts of subsurface storage space that will be required for the implementation of carbon storage at an industrial scale. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in depleted reservoirs aims to ensure subsurface containment, both to satisfy safety considerations, and to provide con fidence that the containment will continue over the necessary timescales. Other technical issues that need to be addressed include the risk of unintended subsurface events, such as induced seismicity. Minimisation of these risks is key to building con fidence in CCS technology, both in relation to financing/liability, and the development and maintenance of public acceptance. These factors may be of particular importance with regard to CCS projects involving depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, where the mechanical effects of production activities must also be considered. Given the importance of caprock behaviour in this context, several previously published geomechanical caprock studies of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are identified and reviewed, comprising experimental and numerical studies of fourteen CCS pilot sites in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, in seven countries (Algeria, Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, UK). Particular emphasis is placed on the amount and types of data collected, the mathematical methods and codes used to conduct geo-mechanical analysis, and the relationship between geomechanical aspects and public perception. Sound geo-mechanical assessment, acting to help minimise operational and financial/liability risks, and the careful re-cognition of the impact of public perception are two key factors that can contribute to the development of a successful CCS project in a depleted hydrocarbon reservoir.

AB  - Questions Restoring grasslands is of great importance to biodiversity conservation to counteract widespread, ongoing losses of plant species diversity. Using source populations in remnant habitats and increasing functional connectivity mediated by grazing animals within and between habitats can benefit grassland restoration efforts. Here we investigate how grazing contributes to vegetation and seed bank diversity and composition in remnant and restored grassland communities in fragmented landscapes. Location Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We investigated the effects of the presence or absence of grazing animals as potential elements of functional connectivity on grassland species composition in both the vegetation layer and in the seed bank. Species inventory and seed bank sampling were carried out in 2 m x 2 m plots in remnant grassland habitats and adjacent restored grasslands on former arable fields. Results Species composition varied between remnant and restored grasslands, with management-dependent species more common in remnant grasslands. Remnant habitats with active grazing management contained a higher number of species in both the vegetation and seed bank compared to restored grasslands, but grazing reduced dispersal limitation from higher distance to source populations for specialist species. Where grazing was absent fewer plant species occurred in both the vegetation and in the seed bank. Conclusion Our results show that grazing livestock play a key role in facilitating both spatial and temporal dispersal in fragmented grasslands. This results in increased species diversity in the vegetation and the seed bank of grazed grasslands compared to those maintained by mowing only. Functional connectivity provided by grazing management increases the possibility for species establishment from both the below-ground seed bank and the surrounding landscape, thus increasing the resilience of plant communities against disturbances or climatic changes.

AB  - Admixtures of birch in Norway spruce plantations are being promoted as a means to increase habitat and species diversity. The implications of this mixture were analysed with regional survey data from southern Sweden. Permanent sample plots from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), with Norway spruce and admixture of birch, were used to describe the temporal trends in the admixture, regarding species composition and competitive strength. Observations from thinned plots show a higher harvest removal in birch (35%) than for Norway spruce (19%). Observations without thinnings in the period before measurement showed that individual birch tree growth was lower compared to Norway spruce and it decreased even more with increasing stand age and competition. In addition, a complementary field survey, with multiple distributed sample plots in each stand, was used to detect within-stand variation of species composition and density. Although within-stand heterogeneity was larger in mixed stands in terms of species composition, it was not different from Norway spruce monocultures in terms of stand density. These two surveys show that the admixture of birch, for several reasons, decreases over stand age and although birch increases tree species diversity, it does not necessary imply a change in density.

AB  - The EU aims at reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 and Finland by 2035. We integrated results of three spatially distributed model systems (FRES, PREBAS, Zonation) to evaluate the potential to reach this goal at both national and regional scale in Finland, by simultaneously considering protection targets of the EU biodiversity (BD) strategy. Modelling of both anthropogenic emissions and forestry measures were carried out, and forested areas important for BD protection were identified based on spatial prioritization. We used scenarios until 2050 based on mitigation measures of the national climate and energy strategy, forestry policies and predicted climate change, and evaluated how implementation of these scenarios would affect greenhouse gas fluxes, carbon storages, and the possibility to reach the carbon neutrality target. Potential new forested areas for BD protection according to the EU 10% protection target provided a significant carbon storage (426-452 TgC) and sequestration potential (- 12 to - 17.5 TgCO(2)eq a(-1)) by 2050, indicating complementarity of emission mitigation and conservation measures. The results of the study can be utilized for integrating climate and BD policies, accounting of ecosystem services for climate regulation, and delimitation of areas for conservation.

AB  - Insect and plant assemblages of dry meadow habitats have declined dramatically since the late nineteenth century due to changes in grassland management practices and the resultant overgrowth of these with nitrophilic vegetation in Finland. The Municipality of Helsinki is committed to developing strategies for the maintenance of urban biodiversity, and networks of meadow habitats provide a potential opportunity for conserving declining plant and insect taxa. We showed that urban dry meadows are important habitats for carabid beetle diversity. Dry rocky meadows and managed sheep's fescue type dry meadows had greater species diversity, more xerophilic species, granivores and autumn-breeding species than matrix grassland habitat. Many open habitat carabid species collected in our study are granivorous and some are known to predate on seeds of abundant generalist plant species. These carabid species may contribute to the maintenance of plant diversity by controlling dominant species. To further enhance urban biodiversity, we recommend (1) the supplementation of dry meadow networks by the appropriate management of existing meadows and potentially supplementary open habitats, (2) the expansion of these by clearing adjacent scrub and secondary woodland (subject to their potential conservation value) and (3) the retention of open vegetation, avoiding its replacement with asphalt. We also recommend the use of habitat creation, such as the construction of dry meadow habitats on landfill hills, traffic noise barriers or green roofs, to further supplement dry meadow networks.

AB  - Many studies have reported increased multi-functionality and financial profits due to a shift from even- to uneven-aged forest management. However, little is known (from long-term experiences or predictions) how alternative management systems could affect national-scale wood production and carbon storage, if adopted over very large areas. We analysed these effects using an area-based framework, in which multiple Markov chain models were used to simulate the development of forests according to different management systems. Classification of forests to wood availability categories was used to determine the system to be applied. We enhanced the framework to allow shifts between management systems that correspond to enforced or voluntary changes in forest use. Simulations of extensive shifts from conventional even-aged management to alternative silvicultural systems revealed interesting developmental patterns that cannot be directly deduced from studies that upscale from smaller areas. Our results show that the amount of carbon stored by Finnish forests can be increased by applying less intensive management systems, although this has trade-offs in terms of harvests and associated financial costs. The level of trade-offs differed depending on the type of forest that shifted between management systems and whether areas were also assumed to be completely set aside from forestry. These differences were further pronounced if the desired harvest levels and their allocation changed along with the management system. If the studied attributes were considered at the same relative scale and with equal weighting, the extensive shifts to alternative management systems exhibited the strongest impact on harvesting costs.

AB  - Forestry in the Central-European mountains is confronted with a severe forest decline, which is attributed to the combined effects of `borealization', brought about by large scale continued spruce (mainly Picea abies) monocultures, and atmospheric deposition. Borealization is defined as enhanced soil acidification and litter accumulation, retarded nutrient cycling and changed forest climate in such planted coniferous forest ecosystems. An additional effect of borealization is a major decline in biodiversity of the stands. Based on a comparative study of Norway spruce and European beech stands in the Krkonose National Park (Czech Republic), it is concluded that traditional management should be abandoned and that management should instead focus on regeneration towards broadleaved or mixed forest stands, to enhance the stability of forest ecosystems and their biodiversity, and to reverse borealization in lower montane zones. Available surveys of forest typology were evaluated for their suitability in regeneration management and were found to be unsuitable, since they reflect the effects of borealization rather than true site conditions. The two main pioneer tree species, birch (Betula pendula) and mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), were found to improve soil conditions and reverse borealization. Furthermore, trends in natural vegetation and soil development in declined forests and clear-cuts, and their relevance for forest restoration management were studied, focusing on borealization and plant species diversity. It is concluded that this natural development offers very good possibilities for a more passive, low-cost restoration management.

AB  - European anthropogenic coastal heathlands are threatened by the cessation of traditional management practices. Fire has a long history in the management of this landscape, and its effect on various species groups has been investigated in previous studies. However, the resolution of these studies is generally rather coarse and is biased towards plants. In this study, we investigate the species diversity and composition of carabid beetles over a 22-year chronosequence of time since last fire in a coastal heathland in western Norway. We show that burning increases alpha species richness, and is particularly important for the richness of typical open habitat species. Our results also show that there are clear compositional differences between assemblages along the chronosequence, supporting the value for landscape scale biodiversity of rotational burning. Species richness is also increased by a higher species turnover between consecutive years in patches that have been burnt recently as compared to patches that have not been burnt for a long time. We conclude that burning is important in maintaining carabid diversity in anthropogenic heaths, and that prescribed burns should aim to create a mosaic of different burn years, preferably with a bias toward younger stages.

AB  - Biomass equations have become a vital estimation tool and a prerequisite for studies on forest productivity, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.
   In this paper a new set of biomass equations were fitted for Eucalyptus globulus in Northern Spain. These equations allow us to estimate the total biomass and above- and below-ground fractions from the basal area and the height of the tree. A dummy variable was included in the model to calculate the root fraction of planted versus coppice stands.
   A descriptive study of the root system was also carried out to complete the information about this component. Root fraction plays an important role in forest structure, but is often omitted in carbon sequestration estimates due to the difficulties and cost associated with measurement. Our results indicated that root biomass accounted for 15% and 35% of total biomass in planted and coppice stands, respectively, at a shoot age equal to 9 years. We also found that the stand type and plantation age influenced the number of roots per root system, the volume of the root system and root length.
   This paper brings to light how coppice stands accumulate significant amounts of carbon in their root systems from the time a plantation is established. Such information makes it possible to orient ecosystem management towards potential for C fixation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant species richness and the presence of certain influential species (sampling effect) drive the stability and functionality of ecosystems as well as primary production and biomass of consumers. However, little is known about these floristic effects on richness and community composition of soil biota in forest habitats owing to methodological constraints. We developed a DNA metabarcoding approach to identify the major eukaryote groups directly from soil with roughly species-level resolution. Using this method, we examined the effects of tree diversity and individual tree species on soil microbial biomass and taxonomic richness of soil biota in two experimental study systems in Finland and Estonia and accounted for edaphic variables and spatial autocorrelation. Our analyses revealed that the effects of tree diversity and individual species on soil biota are largely context dependent. Multiple regression and structural equation modelling suggested that biomass, soil pH, nutrients and tree species directly affect richness of different taxonomic groups. The community composition of most soil organisms was strongly correlated due to similar response to environmental predictors rather than causal relationships. On a local scale, soil resources and tree species have stronger effect on diversity of soil biota than tree species richness per se.

AB  - Key message Climate-warming related replacement of beech by oak forests in the course of natural forest succession or silvicultural decisions may considerably reduce ecosystem carbon storage of central European woodlands.
   Context Climate warming may change the carbon (C) storage in forest biomass and soil through future shifts in tree species composition. With a projected warming by 2-3 K over the twenty-first century, silvicultural adaptation measures and natural succession might lead to the replacement of European beech forests by thermophilic oak forests in drought- and heat-affected regions of central and south-eastern Europe, but the consequences for ecosystem C storage of this species shift are not clear.
   Aims To quantify the change in C storage in biomass and soil with a shift from beech (Fagus sylvatica) to oak forest (Quercus petraea, Q. frainetto, Q. cerris), we measured the aboveground biomass (AGC) and soil C pools (SOC).
   Methods AGC pools and SOC stocks to - 100 cm depth were calculated from forest inventory and volume-related SOC content data for beech, mixed beech-oak and oak forests in three transects in the natural beech-oak ecotone of western Romania, where beech occurs at its heat- and drought-induced distribution limit.
   Results From the cooler, more humid beech forests to the warmer, more xeric oak forests, which are 1-2 K warmer, AGC and SOC pools decreased by about 22% (40 Mg C ha(-1)) and 20% (17 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. The likely main drivers are indirect temperature effects acting through tree species and management in the case of AGC, but direct temperature effects for SOC.
   Conclusion If drought- and heat-affected beech forests in Central Europe are replaced by thermophilic oak forests in future, this will lead to carbon losses of similar to 50-60 Mg ha(-1), thus reducing ecosystem carbon storage substantially.

AB  - Invasive pathogens threaten the ability of forests globally to produce a range of valuable ecosystem services over time. However, the ability to detect such pathogen invasions-and thus to produce appropriate and timely management responses-is relatively low. We argue that a promising approach is to plan and manage forests in a way that increases their resilience to invasive pathogens not yet present or ubiquitous in the forest. This paper is based on a systematic search and critical review of empirical evidence of the effect of a wide range of forest management options on the primary and secondary infection rates of forest pathogens, and on subsequent forest recovery. Our goals are to inform forest management decision making to increase forest resilience, and to identify the most important evidence gaps for future research. The management options for which there is the strongest evidence that they increase forest resilience to pathogens are: reduced forest connectivity, removal or treatment of inoculum sources such as cut stumps, reduced tree density, removal of diseased trees and increased tree species diversity. In all cases the effect of these options on infection dynamics differs greatly amongst tree and pathogen species and between forest environments. However, the lack of consistent effects of silvicultural systems or of thinning, pruning or coppicing treatments is notable. There is also a lack of evidence of how the effects of treatments are influenced by the scale at which they are applied, e.g., the mixture of tree species. An overall conclusion is that forest managers often need to trade-off increased resilience to tree pathogens against other benefits obtained from forests.

AB  - The long-term dynamics. of small mammal communities inhabiting a mosaic of agricultural and forest habitats, that is, mixed forest, lakeside alderwood forest and arable land, set aside in the second period of the study, was analysed. No cyclicity was recorded in the numbers of the dominating species, that is, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Fallowing of the arable land resulted in a decline in diversity and species richness of small mammals in the habitat mosaic under study. The greatest changes were recorded in the community inhabiting a narrow belt of spatially heterogeneous alderwood along the lakeshore. In this community, a considerable increase in the number of yellow-necked mice and a general increase in the dominance of forest species took place. We suggest that the fallowing of extensive arable lands, taking place in Poland for the last two decades, constitute an attractive source of food for small mammals and may lead to a considerable decline in small mammal species diversity within the landscape or even cause local extinctions in some species.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the composition of microscopic fungi colonizing Norway spruce dead wood depending on the degree of decomposition of wood and the location in the Tatra National Park (TPN; southern Poland). The work included lying and standing dead wood of Norway spruce as well as tree stumps. The sampling plots were located in the Bialka Valley (eastern part of the TPN) where the forests are unmanaged and area is mostly under strict protection, and in the western part of the Park, in the Chocholowska Valley, where the majority of forests is privately owned and managed (landscape protection). Samples were collected three times in the growing season, in spring, summer and autumn 2016. The sampling plots were located in the forests covered by different forms of protection: strict, active and landscape. The dominant microscopic fungi inhabiting analysed Norway spruce dead wood in selected regions of the Tatras are fungi belonging to Trichoderina genus: T harzianum: T polysporum, and T hamatum. A much greater diversity of fungi species isolated from the dead wood was found for the Bialka Valley, subjected to strict and active protection, than Chocholowska Valley, where forests are subject of the economic utilisation. More species and colonies were obtained from lying and older dead wood than from the stumps in the higher classes of distribution.

AB  - Valuation of tourism economic impact (EI) in Kemeri National Park (KNP) is a novelty in not only KNP but also it is the first such scale and character research on the national parks in Latvia in general. The aim of KNP is to gain a certification of the sustainable tourism charter in Europe certifying that the development of the park has been planned in a sustainable and balanced way. Thus, an assessment of tourism economic impact in KNP done by the authors was necessary. Data of the valuation base were collected in the result of 1100 KNP visitors' interviews during the tourism season of the year 2010. Using tourism EI theories and calculation methods adapted from the scientific experience of the USA, Finland, and other countries, EI of tourism was stated in five resulting indicators: 1) direct EI is LVL 1827402.97; 2) induced impact - LVL 114448.00; 3) indirect impact - LVL 1838847.77; 4) total EI - LVL 3780698.74 or almost LVL 3.8 million; and 5) multiplier effect of tourism income - 2.07. The main conclusions and suggestions for the administration of KNP are: 1) to carry out a regular and versatile tourism monitoring in different segments, including entrepreneurship and local community located in the territory of KNP or close to it; and 2) consumption cost shall be applied (to sell it) by improving or supplementing the existing tourism offer. Thus, separate events of a widely spread idea in the world would be implemented - to use different business approaches in tourism for national parks financed by the state.

AB  - Half of the world's forest is in boreal and sub-boreal ecozones, containing large carbon stores and fluxes. Carbon lost from headwater streams in these forests is underestimated. We apply a simple stable carbon isotope idea for quantifying the CO2 loss from these small streams; it is based only on in-stream samples and integrates over a significant distance upstream. We demonstrate that conventional methods of determining CO2 loss from streams necessarily underestimate the CO2 loss with results from two catchments. Dissolved carbon export from headwater catchments is similar to CO2 loss from stream surfaces. Most of the CO2 originating in high CO2 groundwaters has been lost before typical in-stream sampling occurs. In the Harp Lake catchment in Canada, headwater streams account for 10% of catchment net CO2 uptake. In the Krycklan catchment in Sweden, this more than doubles the CO2 loss from the catchment. Thus, even when corrected for aquatic CO2 loss measured by conventional methods, boreal and sub-boreal forest carbon budgets currently overestimate carbon sequestration on the landscape.

AB  - A typical feature of the boreal forest landscape is a gradient from dry to wet sites, with associated increases in the depth of the soil organic layers. In this study, the coupled ecosystem-soil biogeochemistry model GUESS-ROMUL is used to explore how the specific features of soil organic matter decomposition and vegetation dynamics account for an observed difference between the soils formed under contrasting moisture conditions. Two sites, one mesic and one mesic-to-wet, representative of the natural forest in Northern Sweden, are simulated. In addition to the assumptions underlying the GUESS-ROMUL model, it is assumed that the fire frequency was higher at the mesic site. The model shows that with a natural fire regime, the soil organic layers at the mesic-to-wet site store 6.0 kg C m(-2) compared to 3.1 kg C m(-2) at the mesic site. Forty-seven percent of the difference between the sites in this respect is explained by suppressed decomposition under higher moisture conditions, 37% by the decreased litter input into the soil (more frequently disturbed ecosystems have lower productivity) and 16% by direct consumption of the forest floor in fires. It is predicted that due to anthropogenic fire suppression the organic soil layers of mesic sites will, in the future, sequester carbon at an average rate of 0.0103 kg C m(-2) year(-1) and have an equilibrium storage capacity of 5.4 kg C m(-2). For the mesic-to-wet site, the model predicts an extremely slow sequestration rate of 0.0022 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The effect of increased precipitation on the carbon storage at the landscape level is also investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical gradients of habitats are a typical characteristic of forest ecosystems. Sun-exposed dead wood in the upper canopy, for instance, provides a habitat for saproxylic beetles distinct from that in the more shaded dead wood below the canopy. Canopy research, however, is challenging due to both the limited accessibility and potential confounding effects of temperature on trapping probability when activity traps are used. We studied saproxylic beetle assemblages along a complete vertical gradient without bias caused by temperature effects on activity. Using crane-like constructions attached to the top of large Silver Fir trees (Abies alba), we exposed bundles of freshly cut branches of European Beech (Fagus sylvatica), Silver Fir and Norway Spruce (Picea abies) in three different vertical strata (upper canopy, mid-canopy and near the ground). The bundles in the upper canopy were fully exposed to the sun and the bundles in the mid-canopy and near the ground were in the shade. We allowed beetles to colonize the bundles of branches for one growing period and then reared beetles from each bundle over three years. The species composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages differed between bundles in the upper canopy and near the ground; bundles in the mid-canopy had an intermediate assemblage composition. The abundance of saproxylic beetles was higher near the ground than in the upper canopy, whereas the number of species showed the opposite pattern. Overlapping confidence intervals of sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves for species diversity indicate that estimated gamma diversity per stratum is similar across the three strata. Our results support earlier studies that revealed the importance of habitat heterogeneity as a driver of the biodiversity of taxa associated with dead wood. As we controlled for wood diameter and tree species diversity, our study suggests that the microclimatic variability within dead wood and thus habitat heterogeneity for saproxylic beetles is higher in the upper canopy than near the ground. For biodiversity conservation in forests, our results support a strategy of enhancing the number of trees with microhabitats, particularly those with dead branches in the upper tree crown. Dead branches and standing dead trees should only be removed, e.g. for safety reasons, if no other option is available.

AB  - During the breeding period, I analysed bird community-habitat relationships in a managed broad-leaved forest of north-western Italy (a newly established nature reserve). Species richness, diversity, biomass and abundance of some ecological groups of birds were analysed with respect to habitat variables, summarising habitat structure, canopy and understorey floral composition. Two major patterns of relationships among bird and habitat were traced: the first involved changes in tree structure during their growth (canopy height and diameter of the dominant tree), the second was related to characteristics associated with floral richness. Bird diversity, species richness, the amount of hole nesters, of trunk and ground feeders were positively associated with stands age. The abundance of some groups of birds was positively related to plant species richness: understorey species richness influenced shrub feeders, shrub nesters and edge species; canopy species richness affected trunk feeders. Canopy species richness also affected bird diversity, richness, biomass, abundance of hole nesters, trunk feeders and forest interior species.

AB  - Forests have an important role to play in climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and wood supply. However, the lower albedo of mature forests compared to bare land implies that focusing only on GHG accounting may lead to biased estimates of forestry's total climatic impacts. An economic model with a high degree of detail of the Norwegian forestry and forest industries is used to simulate GHG fluxes and albedo impacts for the next decades. Albedo is incorporated in a carbon tax/subsidy scheme in the Norwegian forest sector using a partial, spatial equilibrium model. While a price of EUEuro100/tCO(2)e that targets GHG fluxes only results in reduced harvests, the same price including albedo leads to harvest levels that are five times higher in the first five years, with 39% of the national productive forest land base being cleared. The results suggest that policies that only consider GHG fluxes and ignore changes in albedo will not lead to an optimal use of the forest sector for climate change mitigation.Policy relevanceBare land reflects a larger share of incoming solar energy than dense forest and thus has higher albedo. Earlier research has suggested that changes in albedo caused by management of boreal forest may be as important as carbon fluxes for the forest's overall global warming impacts. The presented analysis is the first attempt to link albedo to national-scale forest climate policies. A policy with subsidies to forest owners that generate carbon sequestration and taxes levied on carbon emissions leads to a reduced forest harvest. However, including albedo in the policy alongside carbon fluxes yields very different results, causing initial harvest levels to increase substantially. The inclusion of albedo impacts will make harvests more beneficial for climate change mitigation as compared to a carbon-only policy. Hence, it is likely that carbon policies that ignore albedo will not lead to optimal forest management for climate change mitigation.

AB  - Forest management plays an important role in mitigating the most serious threats to the well-being of current and future generations: climate change and biodiversity loss. We examine citizens' preferences for alternative forest management policy goals, including the provision of carbon sinks, biodiversity, and forest sector jobs, using a discrete choice experiment in Finland. We explore preference heterogeneity using latent class multinomial logit models finding the highest willingness to pay for biodiversity-oriented forest policy. Comparing three forest policy scenarios, focusing on "Biodiversity," "Climate," or "Bioeconomy," citizens preferred the overall environmental goals over economic ones. We observe considerable heterogeneity in respondents' preferences identifying five latent preference classes. The results provide valuable background information on citizens' values and preferences on tradeoffs built into future revisions of forest policy.

AB  - Agricultural land abandonment (ALA) is widespread in many countries of the global north. It impacts rural communities, traditional landscapes, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is an opportunity for ecosystem restoration or new landscape functions. We explored ALA in study areas in Australia, Portugal and Sweden. In each, we assessed plant species diversity, historical trajectories of land cover change; and the socioeconomic past, present and future in interviews with farmers. The ALA data was integrated and analysed by identifying the drivers of change. The relative importance of each driver and its scale of action was estimated, both in the past (1950-2010) and in the future (2010-2030). ALA has transformed rural landscapes in the study areas of Portugal and Sweden. It is at a much earlier stage with potential to increase in the Australian case. We identified a set of driving forces, classified into pressures, frictions and attractors that clarify why ALA, noting its temporal and spatial scale, occurs differently in each study area. The effect of the drivers is related to social and historical contexts. Pressures and attractors encouraging agricultural abandonment are strongest in Portugal and Sweden. Generally more (institutionalized) frictions are in place in these European sites, intended to prevent further change, based on the benefits assumed for biodiversity and aesthetics. In Australia, the stimulation of driving forces to promote a well-managed abandonment of some cleared areas could be highly beneficial for biodiversity, minimally disruptive for current dairy farming operations and would bring opportunities for alternative types of rural development.

AB  - The subject of this study is the economics of harvesting boreal uneven-aged mixed-species forests consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.), and other broadleaves. The analysis is based on an economic description of uneven-aged forestry, applying a size-structured model. The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form using gradient-based interior point methods. When volume yield is maximized, the optimal steady state is a nearly pure Norway spruce stand at all site types, producing slightly higher yields than single-species stands. After including sawlog and pulpwood prices, the net present value of stumpage revenues is maximized using 1%, 3%, and 5% interest rates and a 15-year harvesting interval. At less productive sites, the stands are nearly pure Norway spruce stands, regardless of the interest rate. At more productive sites, increasing the interest rate increases the species diversity, with optimal steady states consisting of both Norway spruce and birch. In some cases, rather small changes in relative prices change the optimal steady state into a birch-dominated stand. Optimal solutions converge to the same steady-state solutions, independent of the initial stand state. If other broadleaves without commercial value are not harvested, they will eventually dominate the stand.

AB  - The species diversity of Clitellata (a group of annelid worms) is described for three river systems in different parts of southern Sweden. The water of one river (Save (a) over circlen) discharges into the harbour of Goteborg on the Swedish west coast, that of the other two rivers (Svart (a) over circlen and Kila (a) over circlen) into the Baltic Sea. A total of 143 species, representing the taxa Enchytraeidae (61), Propappidae (1), Lumbricidae (15), Lumbriculidae (6), Tubificidae (4 Rhyacodrilinae, 33 Naidinae, 13 Tubificinae), and Hirudinida (10), are reported. Of these, 24 enchytraeids and six lumbricids were found only in the riparian zone, i.e., in the semi-aquatic habitats of the river banks. Six species of Enchytraeidae could not be assigned to any known species and are likely to be new to science. In addition, the following species are recorded from Sweden for the first time : Achaeta brevivasa, Fridericia benti, F. healyae, F. lenta, F. sylvatica, Oconnorella tubifera (all Enchytraeidae), Aporrectodea limicola (Lumbricidae), Stylodrilus brachystylus (Lumbriculidae), Dero dorsalis, Nais behningi, Haber speciosus, and Peipsidrilus ?saamicus (all Tubificidae). Overall, the species composition is typical of today's fauna of the once glaciated Northern Europe, but for the family Enchytraeidae, the biogeographical affinity of Sweden is stronger with Denmark and Germany than with, e.g., the British Isles and the eastern parts of Central Europe.

AB  - Soil carbon sequestration is a recognized climate mitigation method, but it involves changes in the practices of more than 0.5 billion farms worldwide. Regionally customized carbon-farming programs are one way to tailor soil carbon storage to local conditions. We conducted farmer participatory research on 105 Finnish farms to investigate how farmers approach carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted training for farmers in the basics of carbon-farming and instructed them to make a Carbon Farming Plan for one of their fields. The plans were evaluated by a team of experts and through soil C balance calculations. In addition, potential nutrient limitations and the existing C stock were identified from soil tests. Although the existing C stocks were relatively high, an assessment of the plans indicated high potential for additional C storage (median 320 kg C ha(-1)year(-1)). The plans did not show any sensitivity to the existing C stock, with similar C inputs planned for low organic matter (OM) and high OM soils. The farmers either did not know their C stock or were not familiar with the C balance concept. Most soil samples showed considerable nutrient deficiencies (P, S, B and Mn), which can limit C storage. The quality of most plans was adequate for research with minor modifications. The largest C storage potential was estimated for measures with large additions of nutrient-poor amendments or in grazing. Most farmers chose measures with relatively low C storage benefits but high potential benefits for soil structure and productivity (cover crops, nutrient-rich amendments, grassland management). The C gain from some measures (subsoiling, diversity in grasslands) could not be estimated with current methodologies. The magnitude of planned C storage over 5 years on most farms was so small (<0.5% OM), that it is challenging to measure it through soil sampling. This finding supports the earlier conclusions that a combination of modeling and soil sampling is needed to verify the C storage.

AB  - 1. Recent reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy aim for a greening of the subsidy system with potential improvements for biodiversity conservation. As part of that process, the tree density limit for pastures to qualify for European Union subsidies has been increased from 50 to 100 trees per hectare. However, recent studies show that the high biodiversity values of these habitats may be threatened by these limits, highlighting the need for policy improvements. Still, little is known about the direct effects of tree density limitations on bird communities in woody pastures.
   2. We investigated how bird diversity and species composition are affected by tree density in 49 Swedish woody pastures along a gradient of 4-214 trees per hectare. We recorded bird communities, tree density and stand structure estimates in the field and estimated forest cover in the surrounding landscape from aerial photos. Using generalised additive models and redundancy analysis, we analysed how bird territorial species richness, bird abundance and species composition are affected by tree density, taking into account other local and landscape scale explanatory variables.
   3. Tree density had a significant positive effect on bird species richness at low tree densities and species richness saturated at approximately 50 trees per hectare. Shrub density had a significant positive linear effect on both bird species richness and abundance. Tree and shrub density were also the major drivers of bird community composition, with secondary effects of tree species diversity and landscape forest cover.
   4. Policy implications. Our results show that tree density is not the limiting factor, but rather a driver of bird diversity and species composition in woody pastures and that tree density limits may fail to capture the whole range of biological values. To improve policy recommendations, we therefore stress the importance of considering additional social-ecological drivers associated to management quality, e.g. taking into account moral and cultural motivations among farmers, to preserve biodiversity in woody pastures.

AB  - To test the effect of reindeer husbandry on soil carbon storage of seasonally frozen ground, we analysed soil and vegetation properties in peatlands and mixed pine and mountain birch forests. We analysed sites with no grazing and contrasting intensities of grazing, and associated trampling, in Northern Finland. With a pilot study approach, we optimised the study design to include several grazing class sites including grazing seasonality but omitting sample replication at one site. Soils were analysed for water content, bulk density, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, stable carbon isotopes and radiocarbon ages. We found that there was no significant difference between grazing intensities in terms of TOC, but that TOC mainly depended on the soils' TOC content present prior to intensive herbivory introduction. In contrast, understory vegetation was visibly transformed from dwarf shrub to graminoid-dominated vegetation with increasing grazing and trampling intensity. Also, we found a decrease in bulk density with increasing animal activity on soil sites, which most likely results from named vegetation changes and therefore different peat structures.

AB  - To support human well-being, green (or ecological) infrastructure policy stresses the need to sustain functional networks of representative terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for the sustainable provision of multiple ecosystem services. Implementing this means that the complexity of interactions between social and ecological systems at multiple spatial scales and levels of governance needs to be understood. Place-based knowledge production and learning through integration of different research disciplines in collaboration with actors and stakeholders (i.e. transdisciplinary research) is a key feature to achieve this goal. Using a suite of local landscapes and regions on the European continent's West and East as a laboratory, we developed and applied a step-wise approach to produce knowledge and encourage learning towards functional green infrastructures. Our diagnoses of forest landscapes show that the functionality for wood production and biodiversity conservation was inversely related in the gradient from long to short forest management histories. In Europe's West there is a need for increased quantity of, and more functional, protected areas; diversification of management methods; and landscape restoration. In NW Russia there are opportunities to intensify forest management, and to continue the land-sparing approach with zoning for different functions, thus reducing biodiversity loss. Examples of diagnoses of social systems included the evaluation of comprehensive planning in Sweden, outcomes for biodiversity conservation of forest certification in Lithuania, and learning from environmental managers. We conclude that the main challenge for securing functional green infrastructure is poor cross-sectoral integration. Treatment of social-ecological systems requires knowledge-based collaboration and learning. The diversity of landscape histories and governance legacies on the European continent's West and East, including Russia, offers grand opportunities for both knowledge production about performance targets for green infrastructure functionality, as well as learning to adapt governance and management to regional contexts. Integrating project funding for both researchers and stakeholder collaboration is a necessary strategy to fill the transdisciplinary research agenda. However, formal and informal disciplinary and administrative barriers can limit team building despite self-reflection and experience.

AB  - Contrary to large-scale disturbances, animals constantly create small-scale patches of various kinds during the course of their daily life. For example, rooting by wild boars is a recurrent disturbance regime, which varies in frequency and extent. Rooting by wild boars (Sus scrofa L.) in south-central Sweden was therefore studied by censusing three times per year during 1992-1995 along fixed transects in the Tullgarn Nature Reserve. Significant differences were found in soil surface area being rooted by wild boar between year, season, habitat type and soil category. The amount of surface being rooted varied between 2.4 and 14.2 ha on 226 ha censused. The rooted surface in relation to the ground available was higher in deciduous compared to coniferous forests and grassland. Furthermore, the rooted surface in relation to available ground to root was much higher in damp soil than in dry soil. Mesic soil was used according to availability. Rooted patches showed large variation in size between year, season, habitat type and soil category. Within the three habitat types the largest patches were found in deciduous forests and the smallest in grasslands while in the different soil categories, the largest patches were found in damp soils and the smallest in dry soils. Results are discussed in terms of plant species diversity on a regional scale.

AB  - The pursuit of sustainable tourism may involve development of more facilities in the buffer zones of national parks and other pristine nature areas. Two independent samples of domestic and foreign tourists in Norway were segmented based on expressed preferences for a diversity of new facilities in an alpine national park region, all facilities potentially with different impacts on the natural habitat. One sample was recruited inside the alpine area, the other outside. Post hoc market segmentation was carried out using a combined two-stage hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering of facility quest factors identified from a set of survey items. We assessed stability of the clusters by comparing independent sample solutions against the pooled sample and further assessing the extent to which the clusters differed with respect to demographic or psychographic characteristics.

AB  - We studied the effects of different cutting intensities (0%, 5-10%, 15%, and 20% basal area removal) on stand growth, structure, and net carbon storage in spruce-fir (Picea jezoensis (Sieb. et Zucc.) Carr.-Abies nephrolepis (Trautv.) Maxim.) and broadleaf mixed forests on Changbai Mountain (Northeast China) over 19 years. At this site, inventory-based low-intensity selection cutting was used to maintain a continuous forest canopy. After two cutting events, results showed significant differences in growth, structure, and carbon storage among cutting intensities. When increasing cutting intensity, the growth rate of average diameter, basal area, and volume significantly increased, with the highest increment rates found in the plots with 20% basal area removal. Tree diameters for all plots showed a roughly inverse J-shaped distribution before cutting and a left-skewed unimodal distribution after two cuttings. Volume ratio (the relative amount of volume contained in different diameter classes) for small (6-14 cm), medium (14-26 cm), large (26-36 cm), and very large (>38 cm) diameters remained unchanged in the plots with 5 and 10% basal area removal, but the volume ratio of large and very large diameters increased in the plots with 15 and 20% basal area removal, reaching approximately a 1: 2: 3: 4 ratio in the plots with 20% basal area removal after two selection cuttings. Net carbon storage increased when increasing cutting intensity, reaching maximum storage in the plots with 20% basal area removal (cutting intensity and net C storage increase: 0%, 7.21 Mg C ha(-1), 5-10%: 11.68 Mg C ha(-1), 15%: 21.41 Mg C ha(-1), 20%: 26.47 Mg C ha(-1)). Therefore, our results show the potential of low-intensity selection cutting to meet demands of both timber production and maintenance of forest cover for biodiversity values.

AB  - An increase in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, including bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), has led to an urgent demand for storage sites, and Norway stands out for its ongoing and planned geological storage sites in a European context. Even though there are no commercial carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) projects in Norway and the North Sea, there is scientific literature linking CO2-EOR and CCS in this geographical region. CO2-EOR utilizes CO2 to extract additional oil, counteracting the climate change mitigation purpose of geological storage. This review article explores how CCS is represented in the scientific literature on CO2-EOR in the North Sea and Norway, with a focus on system synergies and contradictions in relation to climate change mitigation. The main themes in the scientific literature on CO2-EOR in the North Sea are climate change, economics, and geological feasibility. Monitoring, safety, and leakage in addition to transportation of CO2 are less salient. The results show that there are contrasting framings in the literature. One framing is that CO2-EOR is a gateway to large-scale storage which maintains, or even expands, the extraction of fossil fuels and contributes to a sustainable transition in the long run through knowledge building and shared infrastructure. In contrast, another framing is that CO2-EOR combined with CCS have goal conflicts and are therefore not compatible, illustrating complexities with geological storage. Finally, this study reflects on how techno-economic research on CO2 storage in the North Sea and Norway is furthered through critical social science perspectives.

AB  - The consequences of large-scale disturbances magnified by climate extremes and land-use changes in Norway spruce forests in the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) are assessed in this study. The study area is part of the territory of Tatra National Park (TANAP). The driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework was applied to evaluate how the ecosystem and its services are affected. The state of the ecosystem and its potential for provisioning ecosystem services before and after disturbances is expressed by a set of indicators derived mostly from long-term ecological research conducted in TANAP. The differences are classified by a standardised change index (CI). Ten years after the major windthrow disturbance in 2004, all ecosystem services were still below the pre-disturbance state. The most pronounced declines were found in cultural (average CI = 0.69) and provisioning (average CI = 0.86) ecosystem services. Regulating services are recovering faster (average CI = 0.97), with some indicators exceeding the state before the disturbances. Significant changes took place at the tree line, which is a new phenomenon not known from previous disturbances. Despite a gradual recovery of the ecosystem state and functioning, this analysis confirms that there is a serious risk of decline in forest ecosystem benefits according to regional climate change projections. It also indicates the increasing importance of sustainable forest management for safeguarding ecosystem services under changing conditions.

AB  - Key message A model for sustainable planning of urban tree stocks is proposed, incorporating growth, mortality, replacement rates and ecosystem service provision, providing a basis for planning of urban tree stocks. Many recent studies have improved the knowledge about urban trees, their structures, functions, and ecosystem services. We introduce a concept and model for the sustainable management of urban trees, analogous to the concept of sustainable forestry developed by Carl von Carlowitz and others. The main drivers of the model are species-specific tree diameter growth functions and mortality rates. Based on the initial tree stock and options for the annual replanting, the shift of the distribution of the number of trees per age class can be predicted with progressing time. Structural characteristics such as biomass and leaf area are derived from tree dimensions that can be related to functions such as carbon sequestration or cooling. To demonstrate the potential of the dynamic model, we first show how different initial stocks of trees can be quantitatively assessed by sustainability indicators compared to a target stock. Second, we derive proxy variables for ecosystem services (e.g. biomass for carbon sequestration, leaf area for deposition and shading) from a given distribution of the number of trees per age class. Third, we show by scenario analyses how selected ecosystem services and functions may be improved by combining complementary tree species. We exercise one aspect (cooling) of one ecosystem service (temperature mitigation) as an example. The approach integrates mosaic pieces of knowledge about urban trees, their structures, functions, and resulting ecosystem services. The presented model makes this knowledge available for a sustainable management of urban tree stocks. We discuss the potential and relevance of the developed concept and model for ecologically and economically sustainable planning and management, in view of progressing urbanization and environmental changes.

AB  - National parks have become important tourist attractions and tools for regional development. New international initiatives, such as PAN (Protected Area Network) Parks in Europe, now promote sustainable tourism in protected areas. This paper examines the sociocultural sustainability of tourism perceived by local stakeholders of Oulanka National Park in northeastern Finland. The central question concerns the role of PAN Parks certification in community and tourism development. Four discourses were identified, based on 40 semi-structured interviews exploring different views on sociocultural development pertaining to tourism in the national park: (1) integrating nature-based tourism and conservation, (2) defending the rights of local people, (3) stressing the economic utilization of nature and (4) accepting tourism development and the national park. Although local stakeholders mostly have a positive perception of tourism in the park, it cannot be concluded whether the park facilitates development in a sustainable manner or not. Key problems identified are lack of participation opportunities and contradictions with traditional subsistence economies. The various positions of stakeholders in these discourses tend to influence their views on sustainability. Findings imply the necessity to monitor the distribution of benefits and burdens of park development holistically to multiple stakeholders.

AB  - Beech forests reaches its native distribution limit in SE Norway, but is expected to expand substantially northwards due to climate warming. This may potentially result in a fundamental transformation of contemporary Northern European forests, with tentative effects on the associated belowground fungi. Fungal communities mediate vital ecosystem processes such as ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration in boreal forests. To investigate how soil fungi is affected by the vegetation transition from spruce to beech forest, we sampled litter, humus and mineral soil in a forest landscape dominated by beech, spruce or a mixture of these. The fungal communities in the soil samples were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding of the rDNA ITS2 region. Although soil layers were the most important structuring gradient, we found clear differences in fungal species composition between spruce and beech plots. The differences in fungal community composition were most evident in the litter and least in the mineral soil. Decomposers, most notably Mycena, dominated the litter layer while various mycorrhizal fungi dominated the humus and mineral layers. Some ectomycorrhizal taxa, such as Cenoccocum and Russula, were more abundant in spruce forests. Differences in fungal community composition between forest types can potentially have large impacts on carbon sequestration rates.

AB  - It is widely accepted that pine plantation forests will play a critical role in climate change (CC) mitigation, but their vulnerability to CC impacts raises questions about their role. We modeled the impacts of changing climatic variables on forest growth, optimal harvest age, and land expectation value (LEV) for 11 representative slash pine sites in the Southeastern U.S. under two alternative climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Our coupled modeling approach incorporated the 3-PG biological process model, a generalized carbon sequestration economic model, and Pressler's indicator rate formula to determine relative changes in prices, timber and carbon production. We generally found weak impacts of CC on slash pine LEVs and optimal harvest ages, but our results were sensitive to site productivity and location. CC increased LEVs in sites with low productivity for both RCPs. While a 1 degrees C increase led to the greatest LEV increase in Northeastern sites with low and moderate forest productivity conditions, Southeastern sites showed the greatest decreases in LEV. Higher (lower) future land values would shorten (lengthen) the current harvest age for slash pine. Changes in the rate of carbon and stumpage prices had the greatest impact on the rate of marginal economic revenues of slash pine.

AB  - Temperate calcareous grasslands are characterized by high levels of species richness at small spatial scales. Nevertheless, many species from a habitat-specific regional species pool may be absent from local communities and represent the dark diversity' of these sites. Here we investigate dry calcareous grasslands in northern Europe to determine what proportion of the habitat-specific species pool is realized at small scales (i.e. how the community completeness varies) and which mechanisms may be contributing to the relative sizes of the observed and dark diversity. We test whether the absence of particular species in potentially suitable grassland sites is a consequence of dispersal limitation and/or a low ability to tolerate stress (e.g. drought and grazing). We analysed a total of 1223 vegetation plots (1 x 1 m) from dry calcareous grasslands in Sweden, Estonia and western Russia. The species co-occurrence approach was used to estimate the dark diversity for each plot. We calculated the maximum dispersal distance for each of the 291 species in our dataset by using simple plant traits (dispersal syndrome, growth form and seed characteristics). Large seed size was used as proxy for small seed number; tall plant height and low S-strategy type scores were used to characterise low stress-tolerance. Levels of small-scale community completeness were relatively low (more species were absent than present) and varied between the grasslands in different geographic areas. Species in the dark diversity were generally characterized by shorter dispersal distances and greater seed weight (fewer seeds) than species in the observed diversity. Species within the dark diversity were generally taller and had a lower tolerance of stressful conditions. We conclude that, even if temperate grasslands have high levels of small-scale plant diversity, the majority of potentially suitable species in the regional species pool may be absent as a result of dispersal limitation and low stress-tolerance.

AB  - We integrate a carbon net sink and stand-level wood production to analyze their simultaneous optimization as an economic problem. Carbon is included in living trees, wood products, and forest soil. Forestry is specified by a size-structured model for optimizing thinning timing and intensity, rotation period, and the optimal choice of rotation versus continuous cover forestry. The optimal inclusion of a carbon net sink increases the carbon pool mainly in living trees and forest soil, while the effect on the product carbon pool remains minor. With a 3% interest rate, increasing the CO2 price to euro40 per tCO2 increases the total steady-state carbon pool by 131% and the soil carbon accounts for ca. 60% of the increased carbon storage. Omitting soil carbon, as in previous studies, leads to underestimates of the carbon sink, significantly decreasing the optimal total CO2 net sink and achievable economic net gain from joint wood production and carbon management. The inclusion of soil carbon suggests that, in contrast to previous results, a higher CO2 price does not necessarily favor continuous cover forestry.

AB  - Assumptions regarding landowner participation, whether mandatory or voluntary, are an important determinant in evaluating the implications of a carbon offset sales program. We modify an existing intertemporal optimization model of the US forest and agriculture sectors to allow optional involvement of private forest land in a carbon offset market and compare these results to a case in which all private land is enrolled. Our analysis of these two cases and various CO(2)e price levels indicate different responses in carbon stock and flux, forest land area and management, forest product prices, and forest conditions. The results suggest that the cost of sequestering carbon in US forests, using either a voluntary or mandatory carbon offset sales program, may be substantially higher than suggested by earlier studies.

AB  - Forestry in Mala, northern Sweden, coexists with other land uses. Reindeer husbandry is in the area for centuries and requires large areas of grazing land. Competing land uses may threaten the Mala Sami village. The aim of the study was to evaluate increased consideration in forest management towards 1) reindeer husbandry, 2) nature and 3) a combination of the two. These scenarios were compared with forest management as it was in 2009. Results indicate that all three scenarios lead to a decrease in annual harvesting volumes of 0.2 to 0.4 million m(3). Forest industry dominated the economic viability in the area. Forest management adapted to the needs of reindeer husbandry resulted in less potential for yearly harvest, employment and profits from forest industry. On the other hand, it led to an increase in growing stock and consequently the potential for carbon sequestration over time. Indeed the increased sequestration would compensate for all fossil emissions of carbon from the Forest Wood Chain (FWC). The nature scenario had minor effects on economic result and on the emissions of fossil carbon. The combined scenario gave a reduced economic performance for the FWC. A scenario based on forest management accommodating the needs of reindeer husbandry gave the best economic result for the reindeer chain, due to high survival rate of the reindeer. However the economic importance of reindeer husbandry in the region was small compared to the FWC. Results from scenario analysis could serve as a platform for mutual understanding between stakeholders.

AB  - Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) has declined in Finland and it is considered an endangered species. We studied microsatellite variation in four flying squirrel populations in a fragmented landscape in Finland to determine the amount of gene flow and genetic diversity in the populations. Demographic data from these areas suggest that the populations are declining. All the populations are significantly differentiated (F (ST) = 0.23). The most notable result is the high degree of differentiation between two adjacent populations (F (ST) = 0.11) and low genetic variability (number of alleles 3.0) in one of the populations. These findings suggest problems in dispersal and possible fragmentation effects in the landscape where only 10-20% of habitat favorable for the flying squirrel is left. Conservation ensuring dispersal should be urgently considered. Future studies should concentrate on the modeling of the population viability and on the effects of inbreeding in these small populations.

AB  - Bumblebees are well known for their contribution to the ecosystem service of pollination. In urban areas, green space management beneficial to pollinators can be an important step in sustaining large urban bee populations. The abundance, number of species and diversity of bumblebees (Bombus spp), as well as the abundance of honeybees (Apis mellifera), were studied in 13 urban gardens (including allotments) and 13 ornamental flowerbeds (in parks and green spaces) in the city centre of Gothenburg, Sweden. In total, 12 species of bumblebees were observed. Species richness was significantly higher in gardens than in flowerbeds, but diversity (Berger-Parker and Simpson indices) was higher in flowerbeds than in urban gardens. The abundance in gardens was significantly higher and approximately twice that found in flowerbeds. The number of honeybee individuals was positively correlated with the abundance of bumblebees. Neither species richness nor abundance of bumblebees was affected by site size. However, a high flowering frequency positively affected the total number of bumblebee and honeybee individuals at the sites. We conclude that urban gardens contribute to sustaining a high abundance of bumblebees in the city centre, and indirectly facilitates small scale urban food production. A pollinator-friendly management of urban green space with plentiful flowering may promote a community of bumblebees with high abundance and diversity.

AB  - This paper presents an exploratory analysis of foreign tourists' quests for facilities in Norwegian national parks, related to their expressed nature orientation. The analysis was based on a survey among German, Dutch and Danish tourists during the summer season of 2008. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to identify underlying dimensions from indicator questions related to nature orientations and to quest for facilities inside and outside the national parks. The indicator questions were primarily inspired by Nils Uddenberg's classification of modern Swedes' nature orientations. We found a significant, although fairly weak, relationship between nature orientation and quest for facilities, applying multivariate regression modelling. The strongest relationship was found for the quest for larger management measures - oInfrastructure serviceso - supported by nature orientations labelled Challenge or Sightseeing, while these were disapproved of by the traditional outdoor Recreation orientation. The wish for oTracks and signpostso was also upheld by nature orientations Challenge and Sightseeing. A segment of the tourists, based on cluster analysis, indicated that one third requested development of oInfrastructure serviceso, but this segment demanded all kinds of facility developments. The results indicate national park development potentials, clarifying which developments are contended, and diversifying the demand from three major nationalities visiting Norway.

AB  - The landscape-level and multiscale biodiversity monitoring program National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden (NILS) was launched in 2003. NILS is conducted as a sample-based stratified inventory that acquires data across several spatial scales, which is accomplished by combining aerial photo interpretation with field inventory. A total of 631 sample units are distributed across the land base of Sweden, of which 20% are surveyed each year. By 2007 NILS completed the first 5-year inventory phase. As the reinventory in the second 5-year phase (2008 2012) proceeds, experiences and insights accumulate and reflections are made on the setup and accomplishment of the monitoring scheme. In this article, the emphasis is placed on background, scope, objectives, design, and experiences of the NILS program. The main objective is to collect data for and perform analyses of natural landscape changes, degree of anthropogenic impact, prerequisites for natural biological diversity and ecological processes at landscape scale. Different environmental conditions that can have direct or indirect effects on biological diversity are monitored. The program provides data for national and international policy and offers an infrastructure for other monitoring program and research projects. NILS has attracted significant national and international interest during its relatively short time of existence; the number of stakeholders and cooperation partners steadily increases. This is constructive and strengthens the incentive for the multiscale monitoring approach.

AB  - Declines in pollinator abundance and diversity are not only a conservation issue, but also a threat to crop pollination. Maintained infrastructure corridors, such as those containing electricity transmission lines, are potentially important wild pollinator habitat. However, there is a lack of evidence comparing the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators in transmission corridors with other important pollinator habitats. We compared the diversity of a key pollinator group, bumblebees (Bombus spp.), between transmission corridors and the surrounding semi- natural and managed habitat types at 10 sites across Sweden's Uppland region. Our results show that transmission corridors have no impact on bumblebee diversity in the surrounding area. However, transmission corridors and other maintained habitats such as roadsides have a level of bumblebee abundance and diversity comparable to semi- natural grasslands and host species that are important for conservation and ecosystem service provision. Under the current management regime, transmission corridors already provide valuable bumblebee habitat, but given that host plant density is the main determinant of bumblebee abundance, these areas could potentially be enhanced by establishing and maintaining key host plants. We show that in northern temperate regions the maintenance of transmission corridors has the potential to contribute to bumblebee conservation and the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - European forestry is facing many challenges, including the need to adapt to climate change and an unprecedented increase in forest damage. We investigated these challenges in a Norway spruce-dominated mountain region in Central Europe. We used the model Sibyla to explore forest biomass production to the year 2100 under climate change and under two alternative management systems: the currently applied management (CM), which strives to actively improve the forest's adaptive capacity, and no management (NM) as a reference. Because biodiversity is thought to have mostly positive effects on the adaptive capacity of forests and on the quality of ecosystem services, we explored how climate change and management affect indicators of biodiversity. We found a differential response across the elevation-climatic gradient, including a drought-induced decrease in biomass production over large areas. With CM, the support of non-spruce species and the projected improvement of their growth increased tree species diversity. The promotion of species with higher survival rates led to a decrease in forest damage relative to both the present conditions and NM. NM preserved the high density of over-matured spruce trees, which caused forest damage to increase. An abundance of dead wood and large standing trees, which can increase biodiversity, increased with NM. Our results suggest that commercial spruce forests, which are not actively adapted to climate change, tend to preserve their monospecific composition at a cost of increased forest damage. The persisting high rates of damage along with the adverse effects of climate change make the prospects of such forests uncertain.

AB  - For the last three decades, the area of old-growth forest stands in Europe has continued to increase as has their importance in achieving forest-related policy goals. This has triggered an increase in research interest in old-growth forests, both from climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection perspectives. However, carbon stock in old-growth stands in European hemiboreal forests had not been systematically studied. Therefore, in this article, we characterize differences in carbon stock between mature and old-growth stands on fertile mineral soils in hemiboreal Latvia to contribute to the understanding of carbon storage changes under different management strategies for forest lands. Carbon stock varied significantly both between old-growth stands of different dominant tree species and between mature (1.9-2.3 times younger) and old-growth stages of the same dominant species in forest stands. The carbon stock of tree biomass and deadwood was larger in old-growth stands, but their mean annual carbon stock change was significantly lower than in mature stands (27% to 47% depending on dominant tree species). Old-growth stands can serve as carbon reservoirs in areas with limited natural disturbances; however, for maintenance of climate neutrality, it is essential to expand the area of managed stands with larger annual carbon stock increase. Study Implications: Forest ecosystems play a major role in regulation of global climate: They can store high quantities of carbon and also can gain or lose it rather quickly. For the last three decades, the area of old-growth forest stands in Europe has continued to increase as has their importance in achieving forest-related policy goals. Old-growth forests can represent the baseline carbon-carrying capacity in particular conditions. Therefore, we characterized differences in carbon stock between mature and old-growth stands on fertile mineral soils in hemiboreal Latvia to contribute to the understanding of carbon storage and for planning forest management activities.

AB  - Peat soils drained for agriculture and forestry are important sources of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Rewetting effectively reduces these emissions. However, rewetting also increases methane emissions from the soil and, on forestry-drained peatlands, decreases the carbon storage of trees. To analyze the effect of peatland rewetting on the climate, we built radiative forcing scenarios for tropical peat soils, temperate and boreal agricultural peat soils, and temperate and boreal forestry-drained peat soils. The effect of tree and wood product carbon storage in boreal forestry-drained peatlands was also estimated as a case study for Finland. Rewetting of tropical peat soils resulted in immediate cooling. In temperate and boreal agricultural peat soils, the warming effect of methane emissions offsets a major part of the cooling for the first decades after rewetting. In temperate and boreal forestry-drained peat soils, the effect of rewetting was mostly warming for the first decades. In addition, the decrease in tree and wood product carbon storage further delayed the onset of the cooling effect for decades. Global rewetting resulted in increasing climate cooling, reaching -70 mW (m(2)Earth)(-1)in 100 years. Tropical peat soils (9.6 million ha) accounted for approximately two thirds and temperate and boreal agricultural peat soils (13.0 million ha) for one third of the cooling. Forestry-drained peat soils (10.6 million ha) had a negligible effect. We conclude that peatland rewetting is beneficial and important for mitigating climate change, but abandoning tree stands may instead be the best option concerning forestry-drained peatlands.

AB  - The effects of three forest management alternatives on stand development were simulated using the MOTTI stand simulator, a stand-level analysis tool developed for multiple-purpose forestry planning. The simulation results were used to analyse the effects of different management schedules on wood production, profitability, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Stand data from a 35-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stand with a deciduous admixture were used as the starting point. Stand development was simulated for a period of 35 years, and additionally for 65 years for biodiversity analyses. The three management alternatives were-(1) pure spruce stand: two commercial thinnings with removal of deciduous admixture, regeneration at 70 years, goal to maximize wood production; (2) mixed stand: as the previous one, but the deciduous admixture was maintained throughout the rotation, goal to enhance biodiversity; (3) unmanaged: no treatments.
   The pure and mixed alternatives including commercial thinnings outperformed the unmanaged one both in the production of merchantable wood and in profitability (value of standing stock for the unmanaged alternative), but did not notably differ from each other. Carbon sequestration was directly proportional to biomass production and thus highest in the unmanaged alternative. The mixed stand had a 50%, and unmanaged stand 88% higher species richness than the pure stand at the age of 70 years. Prolonging the rotation to 100 years also considerably increased the species richness. The applicability of the results and use of the MOTTI simulator in forestry planning are discussed.

AB  - Even-age industrial forestry practices may alter communities of native species. Thus, identifying coarse patterns of species diversity in industrial forests and understanding how and why these patterns differ from those in naturally disturbed forests can play an essential role in attempts to modify forestry practices to minimize their impacts on native species. This study compares diversity patterns of deadwood habitat structure and saproxylic beetle species in spruce forests with natural disturbance histories (wind and fire) and human disturbance histories (clearcutting and clearcutting with thinning). We specifically examine how beetle diversity differs in relation to disturbance history and how beetle variation is linked to the diversity of deadwood habitats. Beetle and deadwood data were collected from thirty spruce forests in Nova Scotia and analyzed under three related diversity perspectives: alpha (diversity within local forests); beta (heterogeneity among local forests within disturbance classes); and gamma (cumulative species richness within disturbance classes). Few data support a prediction of lower alpha deadwood and beetle diversity in managed forests, or a prediction of lower gamma species richness in managed forests. The beta scale analysis yielded support for the following two hypotheses: (1) beetle assemblages are different in forests with different disturbance histories; (2) turnover of beetle assemblages is higher among naturally disturbed forests than among managed forests. The prediction of lower gamma diversity of saproxylic beetle species in managed forests compared to naturally disturbed forests was not supported. The lack of differences between naturally disturbed and industrial forests in structures that are characteristic of older forests (e.g., large-diameter deadwood) may relate to the presence of residual deadwood in second growth forests lingering from before clearcut harvesting. However, such residual deadwood is only an artifact that will soon decay and not be replaced. This suggests that the continuity of deadwood microhabitats for species that depend on old-forest structures is only short-term.

AB  - 1, Set-aside fields have been an important element of the European agricultural landscape since the introduction of the set-aside scheme by the European Community. However, countries in the European Community differ in their rules for managing set-aside owing to different priorities.
   2, In Sweden, a major goal is to reduce the total use of agricultural pesticides, consequently their use is prohibited in set-aside. The options for weed control are therefore cutting and/or the use of a cover crop.
   3, In this study, we describe the course of succession following the abandonment of farmland managed in different ways. The floristic composition was followed over a 10-year period. Temporal trends in community development are described.
   4. The experiment began in 1975 on farmland at six localities, distributed from southern to northern Sweden. The management treatments involving the application of fertilizers and cutting were applied to plots sown with a cover crop and to plots in which the succession started from bare ground.
   5, We found that competitive interactions between species largely determined the successional course in our study. The competitive success of species was related to the management practices applied but there were also interactions between management and site conditions.
   6. We propose that natural succession can be recommended on poor sites in combination with cutting, mainly to prevent the invasion of woody species. On fertile sites a cover crop should be used to suppress perennial weeds, and cutting is recommended mainly to increase species diversity.

AB  - In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with the agro-ecosystem model DNDC to assess the climate and eutrophication impacts of perennial grass cultivation at five different sites in Sweden. The system was evaluated for two fertilisation rates, 140 and 200 kg N ha(-1). The climate impact showed large variation between the investigated sites. The largest contribution to the climate impact was through soil N2O emissions and emissions associated with mineral fertiliser manufacturing. The highest climate impact was predicted for the site with the highest clay and initial organic carbon content, while lower impacts were predicted for the sandy loam soils, due to low N2O emissions, and for the silty clay loam, due to high carbon sequestration rate. The highest eutrophication potential was estimated for the sandy loam soils, while the sites with finer soil texture had lower eutrophication potential. According to the results, soil properties and weather conditions were more important than fertilisation rate for the climate impact of the system assessed. It was concluded that agro-ecosystem models can add a spatial and temporal dimension to environmental impact assessment in agricultural LCA studies. The results could be used to assist policymakers in optimising use of agricultural land.

AB  - Following the growth of nature-based tourism, national parks have become important tourist attractions and tools for regional development. This article examines how the role of tourism changed in national park planning in Finland in the 2000s by analyzing official planning documents of parks. The planning documents and the policies guiding them are seen to reflect the governance aspects of parks. The study indicates that the role and management value of tourism have clearly increased in Finnish national park planning. In the planning documents, tourism is increasingly justified not only with recreational and educational arguments but also by the aspects of regional development. The aim has been to combine the ecological goals of nature conservation and the socioeconomic goals of nature-based tourism by implementing the principles of sustainable development. This discursive policy shift reflects the rise of neoliberalist politics in which nature conservation has become more instrumental and market oriented than before.

AB  - Sustainability of livestock production is a highly contested issue in agricultural sustainability discourse. This study aimed to assess the environmental impact of farms using semi-natural grasslands in Finland, or so-called High Nature Value (HNV) farms. We estimated the environmental impact of 11 such farms, including greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), nitrogen (N) balance, land occupation, and carbon storage. We also accounted for unique biodiversity, defined in this study as communities that are dependent on semi-natural grasslands. We compared these to the alternative states of the farms, specifically a hypothetical farm with the same production output but without access to semi natural grasslands. GHG emissions at the farm level (tCO(2eq)/ha) in HNV farms were 64% lower than on the alternative farms; GHG emissions at the product level (tCO(2eq)/t LW) and N balance (N kg/ha) were 31% and 235% lower, respectively. The carbon stocks were 163% higher at farm level. Biodiversity values, indicated by the share of semi-natural grassland in management, ranged from 23% to 83% on HNV farms. Six out of eleven farms would need to increase their arable land occupation by an average of 39% of arable land to fulfil their needs for animal feed if they did not utilize semi-natural grassland. This study contributes to growing evidence that HNV farming systems can support sustainable production by minimising arable land occupation, reducing nutrient loses, and increasing carbon storage while maintaining unique biodiversity.

AB  - Diatoms are frequently used as indicators of eutrophication in temperate systems, but little is known about their application to impacted African tropical systems. Five streams located within Gombe Stream National Park and five streams supporting human settlements draining into Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, were investigated for species composition, richness and diversity of epilithic algae. In addition, a trophic diatom index (TDI) developed for monitoring European rivers was applied to these tropical systems. 54 specific and infraspecific diatom taxa representing 20 genera were identified for all sites with Achnanthes s.l., Gomphonema and Navicula s.l. being the most common genera. Species richness varied between 10 and 21 in disturbed streams and 13 and 19 in undisturbed streams. Nutrients were significantly enriched in streams draining the deforested watersheds but indices of diversity and evenness (Shannon H, J and Simpson-Yule D, E) did not show any significant differences between streams in forested and deforested watersheds. Significant differences were observed between pooled data for the TDI between forested and deforested watersheds. Analysis of percent pollution tolerant diatom taxa indicates that organic pollution of streams in deforested watersheds may be contributing to eutrophication. This study shows that African diatoms, cosmopolitan or resembling well-known North American and European taxa, allows for trophic indices tailored to the autecological preferences of species to be applied to new regions, although intensive studies on these African taxa will lead to more accurate results. Measures of species-richness and diversity, historically used to describe the state of an ecosystem, may not be suitable to evaluate streams which are not grossly polluted.

AB  - First-best optimal forest sector carbon policy is examined. Using a forest and energy sector model with a carbon cycle module we show that the renewability and carbon neutrality arguments do not warrant emission free status of wood use. As a general optimality principle, the release of carbon is penalized by a tax and carbon capture is subsidized. However, under the biomass stock change carbon accounting convention, the land owners pay for the roundwood emissions and, to avoid double counting, the use of roundwood is treated as emission free. Yet, the carbon accounting convention followed does not affect the equilibrium outcome. The bioenergy from harvest residues is not emission free either. Furthermore, we show that an optimal policy subsidizes the production of wood products for their carbon sequestration. Correspondingly, carbon removals by biomass growth are subsidized and the harvest residue generation taxed. Numerical solution of the model shows that, although the use of wood is not emission free, it is optimal to increase the use of wood, possibly also in the energy sector. Before the wood use can be increased, the forest biomass will be increased. This carbon sink decreases the net emissions until the forest resources reach a new equilibrium.

AB  - Cities have been identified as key actors in climate change mitigation. Nature based carbon sinks have been suggested as a means of mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions of cities. Although there are several studies on the carbon storage and sequestration (CSS) of urban green, the role of residential sites is not fully understood. In addition, the carbon storage of soils is often excluded. Also the implications for planning require more attention. This study estimates the CSS potential of trees and biochar in urban residential yards and identifies effective means to enhance it. Moreover, the study discusses the results at the city scale. The research is based on a case study in Helsinki, Finland, and applies i-Tree planting tool to assess the current and potential life cycle CSS of the case area. The results reveal that trees and the mixing of biochar into growing medium can increase the CSS considerably. The CSS potential of the case area is 520 kg CO2 per resident during 50 years. The added biochar accounts for 65 % of the capacity and the biomass of trees accounts for 35 %. At the city scale, it would lead to 330 000 t CO2 being stored during 50 years. The findings suggest that green planning could contribute more strongly to climate change mitigation by encouraging the use of biochar and the planting of trees, in addition to ensuring favourable growing conditions.

AB  - Landscapes undergo changes in structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial levels. As a consequence of natural and anthropogenic drivers, these changes affect options for land use. We describe winter land use by reindeer husbandry in the boreal forest in Northern Sweden. The landscape changes in its suitability for husbandry practices due to environmental stochasticity and transformations due to other forms of land use. This creates structures that can either (i) promote flexibility in the form of mobility or (ii) create fragmentation that restricts adaptation to changes. As these drivers are interdependent in their influence on land use practices by reindeer herders, different choices regarding husbandry strategies have to be made within a season and between years. To allow such choices and ensure pastoral resilience to change, boreal forests should be regulated to provide continuity of grazing resources at multiple temporal and spatial levels.

AB  - Euphausiids are an ecologically significant and abundant group of marine zooplankton that form key links between primary producers and consumers in pelagic food webs throughout the world ocean. The euphausiid species, Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii, have boreal-Arctic distributions, occurring in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. The species differ in depth ranges and habitat preferences: T. raschii is found in coastal waters on continental shelf habitats, while T. inermis is abundant in slope and deep water regions. Population genetic analysis based on DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcode region was carried out for identified specimens of T. inermis and T. raschii collected in the Arctic (Beaufort/Chukchi and Norwegian Seas, Svalbard Area) and North Atlantic (Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador Sea, Iqaluit, Hudson Bay). Populations of T. inermis in the N. Atlantic showed high connectivity, but were genetically isolated from the Beaufort/Chukchi Sea population. Population genetic diversity of T. inermis showed high haplotype and nucleotide diversity and no departures from neutral expectations. In contrast, T. raschii showed lower haplotype and nucleotide diversity, with highly significant departures from neutral expectations. A possible hypothesis is that T. raschii experienced a significant historical demographic event (e.g., population bottleneck), while T. inermis maintained a stable population over recent evolutionary history. The results provide new insights into population dynamics and implications for responses to climate change of these key euphausiid species for the Arctic Ocean.

AB  - Objectives: (1) To quantify the contribution of the French forest wood product chain in terms of carbon sequestration and substitution when accounting for both the physical impacts (shifts in tree growth and mortality rates) and the market impacts (increased demand of harvested wood products (HWP)) of climate change (cc) and the subsequent forest managers adaptations; (2) To assess the uncertainty of the impacts on the above carbon balance and on forest allocation; and (3) To assess the role of managers' expectations toward these future, uncertain but highly anticipated, impacts.
   Methodology: We used a bio-economic model of the French Forest Sector (FFSM++) that is able to consider and integrate: (a) the effects of climate change over forest dynamics; (b) forest investment decisions (among groups of species) according to expected profitability; and (c) market effects in terms of regionalised supply, consumption and trade of HWP, depending on the forest resource stocks and international prices. By including both forest dynamics and forest products, we can evaluate the carbon balance taking the following elements into consideration: (a) carbon sequestered in live and dead biomass in the forest; (b) carbon sequestered in HWP; (c) carbon substituted when wood is used in place of fossil fuels or more energy-intensive materials; and (d) carbon released by forest operations.
   When the model is run at constant conditions for the next century, the average carbon potential of French forests is 66.2-125.3 Mt CO2 y(-1), depending on whether we consider only inventoried wood resources, HWP pools and direct energy substitution, or if we also account for the carbon stored in tree branches and roots and if we consider the more indirect, but also largely more subjective, material substitution. These values correspond to 18.3% and 34.7%, respectively, of the French 2010 emissions (361 Mt CO2). However, when we consider both the probable increment of coniferous mortality and changes in forest growth, plus the rise in HWP demand worldwide, the average sequestration rate of the French forest decreases by 6.6-5.8% to 61.8-118.0 Mt CO2 Y-1. Running partial scenarios, we can assess the relative interplay of these two factors, where the price factor increases the HWP stock while decreasing the forest stocks (where the latter effect prevails), while the physical impact of climate change reduces both, but to a lesser extent. Considering short-sighted forest managers, whose behaviour is based uniquely on the observed conditions at the time decisions are made, we obtain a limited effect of the overall carbon balance but a relatively large impact on the area allocation of broadleaved vs. coniferous species.

AB  - Tardigrades are common in many terrestrial environments and habitats. Although little is known on their ecological preferences, previous studies found diversity and community composition significantly affected by various variables. This study associated tardigrade species' records with climatic variables, forest type, and substrate categories exploring tardigrade diversity and species communities to find associations with ecological characteristics of Norwegian forests.A total of 17 473 specimens were identified, encompassing 131 species (including putatively new species) from 305 samples of different substrates (leaf litter, bryophytes, and lichens). Bryophytes and lichens of samples were classified according to the main species, and growth form, and associated with tardigrade species and sample metadata. Tardigrade species' richness was related to climatic variables and forest type, increased with precipitation, decreased with summer temperature, and not varied with precipitation seasonality. Although there was an unbalanced representation of substrate categories in the different forest types, some tendencies were detectable. Mixed oak and birch forests reached the highest species' richness. Tardigrade community composition varied between substrate categories and, to a lesser degree, between forest types, but not with climatic variables. Our study highlights the importance of large-scale variables on tardigrade diversity, and substrate categories for tardigrade community composition.

AB  - Constrasting views are held about the possibility of developing ecologically sustainable forestry in northern boreal forests, the taiga. Foresters tend to be optimistic, but they evaluate 'sustainability' on the sole basis of timber production, whereas some environmentalists express very pessimistic views. The conflict can be resolved on substantial arguments, backed by ecological data. I review ecological characteristics of the taiga and the consequences of modem forest management for the forest fauna, particularly in northwestern Europe. Uniform 'monoculture' would be disastrous for a majority of forest species, but it is, fortunately, impossible to attain: heterogeneity in forest vegetation and stand structure remains. This improves prospects of maintaining a diverse fauna in appropriately managed forests. Systematic surveys to detect patterns in abundance variation, and assessments of ecological conditions for population viability ('minimum requirements') of target species are urgent research priorities. The taiga seems to be a resilient ecological system, and the possibilities of modifying management practices such that they match forest dynamics seem good. I discuss recommendations drawing upon conclusions presented in other papers in this issue.

AB  - The influence of spatial location and density of beech snags on species diversity and distribution patterns of saproxylic beetles was studied in a 2,400 ha forest landscape in southern Sweden. Complete snag surveys were combined with a beetle survey using small window traps directly attached to the beech snags. The density of beech snags a parts per thousand yen30 cm dbh varied between one and seven snags per ha within the study area, corresponding to 1.1-5.1 m(3)/ha. A total of 2,610 specimens of 180 saproxylic beetles species were trapped, of which 19 species were red-listed. Within the study area, the number of red-listed and formerly red-listed species was highest around traps in old-growth stands, intermediate in managed stands contiguous with old-growth and lowest in managed stands isolated from old-growth by a two km-wide zone without beech forest. Logistic regressions revealed negative relationships between distance to old-growth forest and occurrence of eleven species, among them six red-listed or formerly red-listed species. The number of non red-listed species was not correlated with isolation from old-growth forest. The number of red-listed species also increased with snag density within 200-300 m around the traps. Our results suggest that red-listed species generally have a lower dispersal capacity than other saproxylic beetles. We conclude that retention of dead wood close to existing populations is more beneficial for red-listed species than an even distribution of snags across the forest landscape.

AB  - Recently, many studies have found positive biodiversity-productivity relationships in forests. In contrast, different types of correlations have been identified in the analyses of tree diversity-structure-productivity relationships. We suspect that these conflicting conclusions might result from the different developmental stages of the investigated forest stands. We therefore analyzed the development of tree diversity-structure-productivity relationships at the stand level and individual tree level in 192 long-term experimental plots in Central Europe. As a measure of stand productivity, we analyzed stand volume growth (m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). Tree species diversity was quantified by the Shannon index and structural heterogeneity was represented by the Gini coefficient of basal area. For a more detailed analysis at the tree level using a smaller portion of the dataset, the tree position-dependent indices, diameter differentiation index, and aggregation index were used. Whether the effect of structural heterogeneity on stand productivity was positive or negative depended on the stand development stage. In early developmental stages, high structural heterogeneity lowered productivity. In later developmental stages, however, stand structural heterogeneity had a positive effect on productivity. Our study might provide insights regarding the mechanisms underlying the contradictory findings obtained in recent studies dealing with tree diversity-structure-productivity relationships. This knowledge is vital for the adaptation of forest management to meet future demands on forest ecosystems.

AB  - In forest nurseries, foliar fungi play a key role in the health of tree seedlings. The aim of this study was to study the diversity and the development of foliar fungal species associated with nursery-grown Pinus sylvestris, and to evaluate the effect of two biological control products and two growth-stimulating products on seedling growth and disease control, as well as seedling associated fungal community. The study was conducted at four Swedish forest nurseries. Fungal communities were assessed from non-symptomatic needles using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS2 rRNA region. The fungal pathogens Cladosporium sp. (15.1%), Phoma herbarum (14.5%), and Alternaria alternata (5.5%) were among the most abundant fungi. Results showed that the nurseries and the development of fungal communities influenced the occurrence of dominant fungal taxa. Disease prevalence was low and microbial treatments had no significant impact on seedling growth and survival, nor on the number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), species diversity, and species evenness (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the results showed a dynamic change in foliar fungal community structure over the growing season. With appropriate nursery management strategies and under suitable climatic conditions, nursery seedlings can remain healthy even in the presence of fungal pathogens.

AB  - We investigated which of the following environmental factors: the number of years since the windthrow of the tree (the age of dead wood), the phytocenosis (the type of forest community), altitude, exposure, wood hardness and the spatial scale of forest disturbances (small gaps with a few fallen spruces vs large-area windthrows) contributed to the diversity and abundance of lichens inhabiting the exposed wood of windthrown spruce trees in Polish Western Carpathian forests. Both Shannon H index and sum of coverage coefficients rose with increasing age of the wood, levelling off after 11-14 y (diversity) and 14-17 y (abundance). This factor appeared to be the most important for this group of lichens, but the significant positive impact of large-area windthrows on the lichen abundance was also demonstrated by using a GLM model. The age of the wood we precisely determined on the basis of data on Norway spruce mortality collected annually in permanent plots of the Gorce National Park since 2000. Using the Shore durometer we linked the course of the wood-inhabiting lichen succession with wood decay more precisely than before. The largest number of species was associated with medium hard wood, i.e., 51 < x <= 80 on the Shore scale. Based on the NMDS analysis, we distinguished four age groups of logs, differing in lichen abundance and defined by the dominance of distinctive species. A large number of usually corticolous lichen species used the wood of windthrown spruce logs as an optional habitat to survive large-scale, posthurricane forest disturbances.

AB  - Questions: To what extent is species richness in semi-natural grasslands related to local environmental factors and (present/ past) surrounding landscape structure? Do responses of species richness depend on degree of habitat specialization (specialists vs generalists) and/ or scale of the study? Location: O " land, Sweden. Methods: Richness of herbaceous vascular plants (subdivided into richness of grassland specialists and generalists) was recorded within 50 9 50 cm plots and 0.1-4.8 ha grassland polygons. Generalized linearmodels and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify local factors (habitat area and heterogeneity, grazing intensity, habitat continuity) and landscape factors (proportion of surrounding grassland in 2004, 1938 and 1800, and landscape diversity in 2004) associated with the richness estimates. Results: At the polygon scale, both specialist and generalist richness was positively associated with local habitat area and heterogeneity and, independently of area and heterogeneity, with grazing intensity, habitat continuity and amount of surrounding grassland in 1800. At the plot scale, specialist species richness was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity, amount of surrounding grassland in 2004 and landscape diversity. Plot-scale generalist richness was negatively associated with surrounding grassland in 1938 and positively associated with local grazing intensity. Conclusions: Because both habitat specialization and study scale influence conclusions about relationships between species richness and local and landscape factors, the study highlights the need to consider species diversity at multiple spatial scales when making decisions about grassland management. Large-scale (polygon) species richness is influenced by immigration processes, with both specialists and generalists accumulating in old grasslands over centuries of grazing management. Habitat heterogeneity increased specialist species richness at both scales, suggesting that management policies should favour maintenance of a heterogeneous mosaic of open areas, trees and shrubs in temperate grazed grasslands. Although grassland specialists are sensitive to grassland isolation, in extensively managed landscapes with high landscape diversity input of grassland species from the landscape matrix may buffer negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland communities.

AB  - We explored patterns of plant species richness at different spatial scales in 14 habitats in a Swedish rural landscape. Effects of physical conditions, and relationships between species richness and management history reaching back to the 17 (th) century were examined, using old cadastral maps and aerial photographs. The most species-rich habitats were dry open semi- natural grasslands, midfield islets and road verges. Alpha diversity (species richness within sites) was highest in habitats on dry substrates (excluding bedrock with sparse pines) and beta diversity (species richness among sites) was highest in moist to wet habitats. Alpha and beta components of species richness tended to be inversely related among habitats with similar species richness. Management history influenced diversity patterns. Areas managed as grasslands in the 17 th and 18 th century harboured more species than areas outside the villages. We also found significant relationships between species richness and soil type. Silt proved to be the most species- rich topsoil (10- 20 cm) in addition to thin soils top of on green- or limestone bedrock. The variation in species richness due to local relief or form of the site also showed significant relationships, where flat surfaces had the highest number of species. In contrast, no significant relationship was found between species richness and aspect. Our study suggests that present- day diversity patterns are much influenced by management history, and that small habitat, e. g., road verges and midfield islets, are important for maintaining species richness.

AB  - The member states of the European Union use multi-metric macrobenthos indicators to monitor the ecological status of their marine waters in relation to the Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. The indicators translate the general descriptors of ecological quality in the directives into a single value of ecological status by combining indices of species diversity, species sensitivity and density. Studies and inter-calibration exercises have shown that the indicators respond to chemical pollution and organic enrichment, but little is known about their response to bottom trawling. We use linear mixed effects models to analyze how bottom trawling intensity affects the indicators used in the Danish (Danish Quality Index, DKI) and Swedish (Benthic Quality Index, BQI) environmental monitoring programs in the Kattegat, the sea area between Sweden and Denmark. Using year and station as random variables and trawling intensity, habitat type, salinity and depth as fixed variables we find a significant negative relationship between the BQI indicator and bottom trawling, while the DKI is related significantly to salinity, but not to trawling intensity. Among the indicator components, the species diversity and sensitivity indices used in the DKI are not significantly linked to trawling, and trawling only affects the BQI when species sensitivities are derived from rarefied samples. Because the number of species recorded per sample (species density) is limited by the number of individuals per sample (density), we expect species density and density to be positively correlated. This correlation was confirmed by a simulation model and by statistical analysis of the bottom samples in which log species density was highly significantly related to log density (r = 0.75, df = 144, p < 0.001). Without accounting for the effect of density on species density, indicators based on species density will be affected by temporal and spatial variations in density linked e.g. to variable recruitment success. When this variation is accounted for by random year and station effects we find log trawling intensity to explain more of the variation in log density than in the indicators currently used to monitor Good Ecological and Environmental Status in the Kattegat. Disregarding random effects and the relationship between density and species density, the impacts of bottom trawling are likely to be lost in the translation of ecological quality into macrobenthos indicators.

AB  - Understanding the activities and preferences of visitors is crucial for managing protected areas and planning conservation strategies. Conservation culturomics promotes the use of user-generated online content in conservation science. Geotagged social media content is a unique source of in situ information on human presence and activities in nature. Photographs posted on social media platforms are a promising source of information, but analyzing large volumes of photographs manually remains laborious. We examined the application of state-of-the-art computer-vision methods to studying human-nature interactions. We used semantic clustering, scene classification, and object detection to automatically analyze photographs taken in Finnish national parks by domestic and international visitors. Our results showed that human-nature interactions can be extracted from user-generated photographs with computer vision. The different methods complemented each other by revealing broad visual themes related to level of the data set, landscape photogeneity, and human activities. Geotagged photographs revealed distinct regional profiles for national parks (e.g., preferences in landscapes and activities), which are potentially useful in park management. Photographic content differed between domestic and international visitors, which indicates differences in activities and preferences. Information extracted automatically from photographs can help identify preferences among diverse visitor groups, which can be used to create profiles of national parks for conservation marketing and to support conservation strategies that rely on public acceptance.

AB  - A number of political initiatives have been implemented to meet growing concerns about negative side effects of the intensification of land-use practice over the past 25 years. Declining species diversity and abundance and pollution of the environment have been reported worldwide. In order to assess the overall effect on wild flora of the changing management of arable land, national surveys are necessary. Surveys of the weed flora in Danish arable fields were conducted in 1987-89 and 2001-04. The frequency of common weed species in spring barley, spring rape, winter rye, winter wheat and grass leys was compared between time periods. Weed frequency increased overall during the interval. Species that are of particular importance as food sources for invertebrates and birds increased considerably in some of the crops. The frequency of some grass species increased remarkably, possibly because of increased areas of winter crops. Some perennial weeds also became more frequent, probably caused by less mechanical weed control and a reduction in the use of specific herbicides. The dominant weed species in 2001-04, with frequency higher than 10%, were largely the same as in 1987-89, but included three new species in 2001-04. Only a few species occurred less frequently in 2001-04 than in 1987-89 and only in some crops. As common weed species make up an important food reservoir for wildlife, new trends in the management of arable land in Denmark seem to have led to more biodiversity.

AB  - Introduction
   A main goal of protected areas is to maintain species diversity and the integrity of biological assemblages. Intensifying land use in the matrix surrounding protected areas creates a challenge for biodiversity conservation. Earlier studies have mainly focused on taxonomic diversity within protected areas. However, functional and especially phylogenetic diversities are less studied phenomena, especially with respect to the impacts of the matrix that surrounds protected areas. Phylogenetic diversity refers to the range of evolutionary lineages, the maintenance of which ensures that future evolutionary potential is safeguarded. Functional diversity refers to the range of ecological roles that members of a community perform. For ecosystem functioning and long-term resilience, they are at least as important as taxonomic diversity.
   Aim
   We studied how the characteristics of protected areas and land use intensity in the surrounding matrix affect the diversity of bird communities in protected boreal forests. We used line-transect count and land-cover data from 91 forest reserves in Northern Finland, and land-cover data from buffer zones surrounding these reserves. We studied if habitat diversity and productivity inside protected areas, and intensity of forest management in the matrix have consistent effects on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities, and community specialization.
   Results
   We found that habitat diversity and productivity inside protected areas have strong effects on all diversity metrics, but matrix effects were inconsistent. The proportion of old forest in the matrix, reflecting low intensity forest management, had positive effects on community specialization. Interestingly, functional diversity increased with increasing logging intensity in the matrix.
   Conclusions
   Our results indicate that boreal forest reserves are not able to maintain their species composition and abundances if embedded in a severely degraded matrix. Our study also highlights the importance of focusing on different aspects of biodiversity.

AB  - Vegetation on mountains is expected to react in a highly sensitive way to climate change and species losses are predicted in the near future. By means of monitoring studies changes in species diversity can be continuously recorded. In this paper the results of a 7-year study in the Southern Alps are reported. As part of the worldwide network GLORIA (The Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments) four summits, at altitudes ranging from the treeline to the alpine-subnival ecotone (2199, 2463, 2757 and 2893 m a.s.l.) in the Dolomites (northern Italy) were studied. Sites on the four summits were used to determine the effects of climate warming and observe changes in the numbers of species of vascular plants, frequency and composition. It is hypothesized that 'thermophilization' is likely to occur over a period of 7 years (i.e. species from lower altitudes are expected to migrate to the summits due to climate warming). It is also hypothesized that nival, alpine-subnival and endemic species might decrease due to competitive displacement by species from lower altitudes. The summit areas were comprehensively sampled (from the highest point down to the 10 m contour line) in 2001, 2006 and 2008. In addition, 4 x 1 m(2) permanent plots located 5 m below the highest summit point on the north, south, east and west sides of each summit were sampled. The results of revisiting the summits indicate that the number of species increased on all four summits, with the greatest gains (15% and 18%) recorded on the two highest summits and moderate gains (4% and 9%) on the two lower summits. Species' frequencies within the 1 m2 plots also increased during the 2001-2008 period. A thermophilization trend was demonstrated in which species with distribution centres in the montane or tree line zones were found for the first time on three of the summits. On the lowest summit, the vigorous growth of trees and establishment of new saplings indicate an upward migration of the forest boundary. Species that disappeared from the four summits belonged to species with different altitudinal ranges; however, nival and subnival-alpine species remained. One endemic species, Potentilla nitida, disappeared from the highest summit. Further changes and clearer trends are expected in the next decade.

AB  - In this study, effects of altered rotation length, nitrogen deposition and changing climate on harvest removal and carbon sequestration of forest, as well as on economic profitability of forestry, were assessed. This study was based on simulations with a gap-type forest succession model in the conditions that represent Scots pine stands in southern Finland.
   Both warmer climatic conditions and increased nitrogen deposition enhanced forest productivity and timber yield. This also shortened the optimum rotations based on mean annual yield and soil expectation value. The highest carbon stock in forests, i.e. the highest mean annual carbon stock in the forest over a rotation period, was achieved with long rotations and higher nitrogen deposition. However, a warmer climate had an opposite effect on the forest carbon stock, because enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter resulted in a lower carbon stock in the forest soil.

AB  - In the conservation of forests and protected areas, a gap lies between scientific knowledge and the management decisions made. From our perspective as scientists studying a national park, who deal daily with both research and administration, we discuss the general reasons for this gap. We provide examples (saproxylic beetles and Norway spruce genetics) to demonstrate the dilemma of practitioners who aim at basing their decisions on evidence. From our experience, the approach of problem solving is crucial, yet in many cases, the bidirectional bridge between science and application is poorly established. We specifically urge governments to organize nation-wide species distribution data; scientists to support the conservation community with new functional approaches, also in combination with Red Lists to identify diversity hotspots and major threats; stakeholders to identify land-use alternatives for scientists to study; state research institutes to increase the proportion of scientists; scientists and governmental authorities to regularly summarize scientific results and conclusions for practitioners; and agencies should foster incentives for scientists to deal with conservation efforts.

AB  - As proposed by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)-Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Life Cycle Initiative (MilA i Canals et al., Int J Life Cycle Assess 18:1265-1277, 2007 and Koellner et al., Int J Life Cycle Assess 18:1188-1202, 2013), the impacts of land occupation should be studied in comparison to a baseline. Regardless of these guidelines, a land use baseline is often ignored in agro-bioenergy life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. This paper tests the appropriateness and significance of applying natural regeneration as a land use baseline for assessing the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of agro-bioenergy in Finland.
   In the land use baseline applied, the land is assumed to be left to regenerate toward its natural state, which, in Finland, would most probably be some sort of forest. The foregone carbon stock of the natural regeneration baseline was estimated based on the literature. The GHG balances were studied by comparing the cumulative warming impacts of the dynamic biomass carbon cycle of the agro-bioenergy production system and the defined baseline over a given time horizon varying from 0 to 100 years. The significance of the results is illustrated by comparing them to other GHG emissions related to bioenergy.
   The results depend significantly on the agro-bioenergy yields and the carbon sequestration rate assumed in the natural regeneration baseline scenario. The GHG balances may be of the same magnitude as GHG emissions due to indirect land use changes resulting from market-mediated impacts, life cycle emissions of fossil fuels, and relative reduction in carbon stocks due to forest harvesting for bioenergy.
   Ignoring a dynamic land use baseline results in misleading conclusions on the GHG balances of land occupation, including agro-bioenergy, due to ignorance of foregone carbon sequestration. Thus, the interpretation of the results and conclusions provided in the vast number of agro-bioenergy LCA studies relying on biomass carbon neutrality should be reassessed. Besides bioenergy, the issue of land use baseline is relevant for any provision service function of land occupation. The foregone carbon sequestration is, however, highly uncertain and thus speculative.

AB  - Riparian forests are expected to play a crucial role in the global carbon (C) cycle but the complex mechanisms of C sequestration in forests remain poorly understood. This study used a comprehensive approach to analyze C sequestration that included the main C compartments in forests, i.e., litterfall, fine roots, and aboveground woody biomass. We aimed at modeling each of them in response to an array of environmental drivers to untangle the functioning of C sequestration by compartment. The study was conducted in a Central European riparian forest that is part of the Donau-Auen National Park in Austria. Carbon sequestration by compartment was correlated with environmental parameters (climate, stream flow, hydrological, spatial, and forest stand parameters) using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), and the correlations were prioritized by hierarchical partitioning. Our results suggest divergent responses of C sequestration in different ecosystem compartments under dry and wet soil conditions. In particular, dry conditions led to significantly higher C sequestration in aboveground woody biomass (larger distance to the low groundwater table), whereas wetter conditions fostered C sequestration in fine-root (smaller magnitude of fluctuation in the groundwater table) and leaf biomass (smaller distance to the low groundwater table). Fine roots and litterfall responded to short-term variations in climate (mean annual temperature) and flooding parameters (duration of the low to mean Danube River water level in the previous dormant season), highlighting the pivotal role of the dynamic fine-root and leaf biomass compartments for C uptake in forest ecosystems. Consequently, litterfall and fine roots should be considered to improve the sensitivity of C sequestration model responses to climate scenarios.

AB  - Tree species diversity is a key parameter to describe forest ecosystems. It is, for example, important for issues such as wildlife habitat modeling and close-to-nature forest management. We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer's accuracies ranged between 33% (European hornbeam) and 94% (European beech) and the user's accuracies between 57% (European hornbeam) and 92% (Lawson's cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive literature review on tree species classification comprising about 20 studies is presented.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle as a potential sink or source. Land management influences SOC storage, so the European Parliament decided in 2013 that changes in carbon stocks within a certain land use type, including arable land, must be reported by all member countries in their national inventory reports for greenhouse gas emissions. Here we show the temporal dynamics of SOC during the past 2 decades in Swedish agricultural soils, based on soil inventories conducted in 19881997 (Inventory I), 2001-2007 (Inventory II) and from 2010 onwards (Inventory III), and link SOC changes with trends in agricultural management. From Inventory I to Inventory II, SOC increased in 16 out of 21 Swedish counties, while from Inventory I to Inventory III it increased in 18 out of 21 counties. Mean topsoil (0-20 cm) SOC concentration for the entire country increased from 2.48 to 2.67% C (a relative increase of 7.7 %, or 0.38% yr(-1)) over the whole period. We attributed this to a substantial increase in ley as a proportion of total agricultural area in all counties. The horse population in Sweden has more than doubled since 1981 and was identified as the main driver for this management change (R-2 = 0.72). Due to subsidies introduced in the early 1990s, the area of long-term set-aside (mostly old leys) also contributed to the increase in area of ley. The carbon sink function of Swedish agricultural soils demonstrated in this study differs from trends found in neighbouring countries. This indicates that country-specific or local socio-economic drivers for land management must be accounted for in larger-scale predictions.

AB  - Mining activities create wastelands that require reclamation. The relief of abandoned opencast oil shale mining area is rugged, and the mining spoil is extremely stony and alkaline (pH 8), with low N and organic content. Planting of fast-growing deciduous tree species such as silver birch (Betula pendula) on post-mining area is the best means to accelerate the development of a new forest ecosystem in such harsh conditions. A chronosequence of silver birch stands (1, 2, 3, 5, 29, 40 years old) was investigated to reveal changes in bulk soil (S) and rhizosphere (R) properties, in rhizosphere effect on bacterial activity and diversity, and in fine-root morphological adaptations in relation to stand development. The rhizosphere effect on bacterial activity was measured as a rhizosphere/soil (R/S) ratio and on species diversity as a similarity (%) between rhizosphere and bulk soil bacterial communities. Bacterial species diversity was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique and was expressed as Shannon diversity index. Biolog EcoPlates were used to determine the summed activity of cultivable bacteria in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Short-root morphological parameters were measured using WinRHIZO (TM) Pro.
   Soil pH and available P concentration decreased logarithmically, and N% and organic matter concentration increased linearly with increasing stand age. During the first 30 years of stand development SIR increased an order, from 0.18 to 1.90 mg C g(-1). Bulk soil bacterial diversity increased logarithmically with stand age. The bacterial diversity was higher in rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Rhizosphere effect on bacterial activity was low a year after planting, increased more than two times in the next 2 years, and decreased thereafter rapidly with stand age. Rhizosphere effect, indicating plant support to rhizosphere microbial communities, was highest when soil conditions were still poor, but trees had already overcome the transplant shock. All short-root morphological parameters showed certain trends with age. Specific short-root length varied between 56 and 313 m g(-1) and decreased logarithmically with stand age and soil improvement. The fastest changes in short-root morphology, rhizosphere effect, and soil pH occurred during the early development of silver birch stands - in the first 5 years; P nutrition and N use efficiency improved simultaneously. Rhizosphere effect and short-root morphological adaptation have an important role in soil and stand development on oil shale post-mining area, and silver birch is a promising tree species for reclamation of alkaline mining spoil.

AB  - The Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) is a methane seep that is densely populated by the bacteria Beggiatoa spp. as well as by tubeworms of the Family Siboglinidae. Analyses of samples from seven stations located in five different habitats (bare sediments, bacterial mats, siboglinid fields, sediments with small patches of siboglinids and areas of 'normal' sea floor) revealed differences in the density and species-level diversity of nematode communities. Total densities increased from stations inside the mud volcano and on its rim towards the 'normal' areas outside the volcano. Nematode species diversity was similar in samples from the siboglinid fields and the bare HMMV sediments. However, the sediment with patches of siboglinids collected outside the volcano was characterised by a diverse nematode community comprising 47 species, whereas the control sediments without siboglinids yielded only 27 species. The nematode assemblage at the bacterial mat site included only two identified species, Halomonhystera disjuncta and Sabatieria ornata, with H. disjuncta being strongly dominant. Terschellingia distlamphida, S. ornata and Aponema ninae dominated nematode communities at the siboglinid fields and in bare HMMV sediments. Species dominating at stations inside the caldera were found in comparable low densities in the sediment with siboglinid patches collected outside the volcano, but were missing in the background samples, where species of Endeolophos, Acantholaimus and Desmoscolex were dominant. Species diversity generally decreased with sediment depth. A subsurface-dwelling nematode community was observed in the siboglinid fields and the bare sediments. Background sediments showed a sharp decline with 18-20 species at 0-2 cm versus three species at 3-5 cm sediment depth. The trophic composition of the nematode fauna at the HMMV showed a prevalence of deposit feeders at almost all stations, whereas background sediments exhibited a uniform distribution of non-selective and selective deposit feeders and epistrate feeders. The high percentage of deposit feeders inside the mud volcano could be related to the grain-size distribution and the significantly higher bacterial biomass compared to the control sediments.

AB  - We used published data from nine sites where nutrient and water optimization studies had been installed in a 2 x 2 factorial design to determine maximum biomass production in response to a simple set of treatments. We tested for site and treatment effects on the relationships between stem, above-ground (stem, branches, foliage) and total (aboveground + roots) biomass production versus intercepted light (light use efficiency, LUE). We also estimated the additional carbon stored as a result of treatment. The sites were located in Australia (Pinus radiata), Brazil (Eucalyptus grandis x urophylla), France (Pinus pinaster), the United States in Georgia and North Carolina (Pinus taeda) and Hawaii (Eucalyptus saligna), Portugal (Eucalyptus globulus), South Africa (E. grandis), and Sweden (Picea abies). We hypothesized that site, treatment and their interaction would significantly affect LUE; however, we rejected our hypothesis because stem, aboveground and total LUE were not affected by site or treatment. The stem, aboveground and total LUE values were 1.21, 1.51, and 0.85 g MJ(-1), respectively. The total LUE value was lower than that for stem and aboveground LUE because a different population was used for the analysis (only five of the nine sites had total production data), and the total LUE relationship had a zero intercept whereas the stem and aboveground LUE relationships had a negative intercept. The average amount of additional carbon that would be stored by the irrigation, fertilization, and fertilization plus irrigation treatments was 3.9, 6.8 and 13.4 Mg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These additional carbon storage estimates, based on these research studies with annual nutrient and water applications, were similar to results obtained in operational settings with less intensive nutrient applications.

AB  - A new technology has been developed that allows generation of electricity from natural gas or other hydrogen-rich fuels without emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It involves tubular solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in an integrated carbon dioxide recovery configuration that uses a solid-state afterburner to complete the oxidation of the fuel without introducing air into the exhaust stream. These types of fuel cells exhaust high purity CO(2) that could be disposed of by injection into the subsurface at costs that are below that of alternative carbon dioxide abatement technologies. The hew technology will be demonstrated with 250 kWe power plant at a coastal site in Norway that is located adjacent to a fish farm. In addition to power and heat the fish farm will utilize the CO(2) produced by the demonstration plant As a nutrient for the algae upon which the fish feed.

AB  - The Carbon Capture Utilization & Sequestration (Storage) (CCUS) marketplace is lacking standardization and therefore the ability to allow CCUS projects to advance as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects as well as to advance to full scale commercialization. An international effort between the United States and Canada, funded by the International Performance Assessment Centre for Geologic Storage of Carbon Dioxide (IPAC-CO2 Research Inc.), and managed by CSA Standards, have developed the first internationally recognized Standard for the geologic storage of carbon dioxide (Z-741). The Z-741 Standard has been adopted by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and is available to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). As a direct result of Z-741, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has created a technical committee to advance the development of comprehensive international standards that address CCUS. This ISO Technical Committee (TC) 265, Carbon dioxide capture, transportation, and geological storage, recently announced the creation of a new working group (WG) focused on standardization in connection with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) related carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. The new group, WG 6, CO2 EOR, was created at the TC-265 third plenary meeting, held at the China University of Petroleum-Beijing on September 23-25, 2013.
   During the Beijing meeting, the U.S. and Norway proposed the creation of WG 6 following a presentation on CO2 EOR. The U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to ISO TC 265, administered by CSA Group, an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) organizational member and accredited standards developer, named the U.S. as convener and Norway as co-convener. WG 6 will focus on standardization efforts associated with low-pressure subsurface oil field operating environments and related CO2 recovery operations, as well as the harmonization of CO2 supplies with EOR operations both on a daily basis and over multi-year operational horizons, among other topics. WG 6 has issued an international call for expert participation in its development of standards and other documents related to CO2 EOR.
   This paper will address key issues experienced in the standard development process, which is a technical, consensus-based facilitated process. Membership of the Committee is drawn from experts with full project life cycle knowledge and experience general interest, operators/industry, regulatory, and consultant/service providers, which represent a balance of stakeholder needs.

AB  - We assessed the species richness and aboveground productivity of understory plants in nine types of forest stand (116 plots in total) that had different disturbance histories that were combinations of the frequency of plantation (clear-cutting, site preparation, planting), typhoon damage, and selective cutting. We established two 1 m x 1 m quadrats to measure species richness and productivity and one 1 m x 30 m belt to measure species richness in each plot. Canopy leaf area index (LAI), soil NH4+, Soil C/N ratio, slope angle, and slope aspect were measured as current environmental factors affecting each plot. The variance in species richness was better explained by disturbance history (69% in quadrats; 86% in the belt) than by current environmental factors. Species richness and the Simpson index decreased as the frequency of plantation increased. In contrast, the variance in productivity was better explained by current environmental factors (82%), especially canopy LAI (45%), than by disturbance history. The relations of species presence and productivity to the explanatory variables differed among species, although there were some common responses within life forms. The effects of disturbance on species diversity remained for 20-80 years. Forest management should therefore take into account the long-term effects of disturbance history to maintain understory plant diversity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We integrate a carbon net sink and stand-level wood production to analyze their simultaneous optimization as an economic problem. Carbon is included in living trees, wood products, and forest soil. Forestry is specified by a size-structured model for optimizing thinning timing and intensity, rotation period, and the optimal choice of rotation versus continuous cover forestry. The optimal inclusion of a carbon net sink increases the carbon pool mainly in living trees and forest soil, while the effect on the product carbon pool remains minor. With a 3% interest rate, increasing the CO2 price to euro40 per tCO2 increases the total steady-state carbon pool by 131% and the soil carbon accounts for ca. 60% of the increased carbon storage. Omitting soil carbon, as in previous studies, leads to underestimates of the carbon sink, significantly decreasing the optimal total CO2 net sink and achievable economic net gain from joint wood production and carbon management. The inclusion of soil carbon suggests that, in contrast to previous results, a higher CO2 price does not necessarily favor continuous cover forestry.

AB  - Responsible forest policy promotes management that does not impair the multiple uses of forests or decrease their regulative effects and biological diversity. The most important regulative effect of boreal forests is their ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. High biological diversity improves the resilience of forest ecosystems and forest-based economies, enhancing the long-term sustainability of forest production. This study developed a method for assessing the performance of forest management in terms of its effects on multiple uses, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. These externalities were described with 11 indicator variables, which can be calculated for any Finnish forest stand from the current forest inventory data with currently available models and algorithms. The indicator variables were normalized based on the ranges of the indicator variables in Finnish forests on different sites. The forest-level averages of the normalized indicator variables were used to calculate a multiplicative externality score for the forest. The developed method for calculating the forest-wide externality score was used in two forest holdings for alternative silvicultural systems. The case study results suggested that continuous cover management enhances the positive externalities of timber production, as compared to even aged rotation forestry. Green-tree retention improved the externality score in both silvicultural systems. Maximizing the net present value of timber production in rotation forestry decreased the externality score by about 50% compared to a non-managed forest. The decrease was about 30% smaller in continuous cover forestry.

AB  - Sufficient genetic diversity can aid populations to persist in dynamic and fragmented environments. Understanding which mechanisms regulate genetic diversity of riverine fish can therefore advance current conservation strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate how habitat fragmentation interacted with population genetic diversity and individual behaviour of freshwater fish in large river systems. We studied a population of the long-distance migratory, iteroparous freshwater salmonid European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in south-eastern Norway. Genotyping (n = 527) and radio-tracking (n = 54) of adult fish throughout a 169-km river section revealed three major migration barriers limiting gene flow and depleting genetic diversity upstream. Individuals from upstream areas that had dispersed downstream of barriers showed different movement behaviour than local genotypes. No natal philopatry was found in a large unfragmented river section, in contrast to strong fidelity to spawning tributaries known for individuals overwintering in lakes. We conclude that (a) upstream sub-populations in fragmented rivers show less genetic variation, making it less likely for them to adapt to environmental changes; (b) fish with distinct genotypes in the same habitat can differ in their behaviour; (c) spawning site selection (natal philopatry) can differ between fish of the same species living in different habitats. Together this implies that habitat loss and fragmentation may differently affect individual fish of the same species if they live in different types or sections of habitat. Studying behaviour and genetic diversity of fish can unravel their complex ecology and help minimize human impact.

AB  - In 1965 D.V. Ager highlighted the concept of morphological adaptations of Mesozoic brachiopods to different environments. Rocky shores were only indirectly included in his seven habitats, undoubtedly due their rarity in the fossil record. A diverse brachiopod fauna, comprising 19 species, lived on the late early Campanian gneissic rocky shore at the palaeo-island of Ivo, southern Sweden. The brachiopods show many different morphological adaptations to the contrasting local habitats in the turbulent and highly variable environment. They are grouped into guilds and related to preferred habitats according to their morphology, substrate strategies, mode of life and preservation. Four main local habitats are recognized, representing different energy and illumination conditions, ranging from protected areas below and between gneiss boulders and hummocks to the most exposed areas on the vertical sides of these rocks. Medium-sized delicate species preferred the protected habitats, whereas large, robust species occupied the most exposed habitats. No small-sized brachiopod species are known from Ivo Klack in marked contrast to contemporaneous faunas of the more basinal chalks. The only observed direct indication of predation on the brachiopods is boreholes after carnivorous gastropods. The brachiopod fauna is by far the richest in terms of species diversity compared not only to other Late Cretaceous rocky shore faunas worldwide, but rocky shore faunas in the entire Phanerozoic. This difference is so remarkable that it cannot be explained by taphonomic factors alone and the density and diversity of the well-preserved brachiopods at Ivo Klack and the great variety in shell morphologies gives a unique opportunity to examine the variety in attachment strategies used in such a highly variable environment.

AB  - Questions: (1) Does soil acidification in calcareous sandy grasslands lead to loss of plant diversity? (2) What is the relationship between the soil content of lime and the plant availability of mineral nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in sandy grasslands?
   Location: Sandy glaciofluvial deposits in south-eastern Sweden covered by xeric sand calcareous grasslands (EU habitat directive 6120).
   Methods: Soil and vegetation were investigated in most of the xeric sand calcareous grasslands in the Scania region (136 sample plots distributed over four or five major areas and about 25 different sites). Environmental variables were recorded at each plot, and soil samples were analysed for exchangeable P and N. as well as limestone content and pH. Data were analysed with regression analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.
   Results: Plant species richness was highest on weakly acid to slightly alkaline soil; a number of nationally red-listed species showed a similar pattern. Plant species diversity and number of red-listed species increased with slope. Where the topsoil had been acidified, limestone was rarely present above a depth of 30 cm. The presence of limestone restricts the availability of soil P, placing a major constraint on primary productivity in sandy soils.
   Conclusions: Acidification of sandy grasslands leads to reduced abundance of desirable species, although the overall effect is rather weak between pH 5 and pH 9. Slopes are important for high diversity in sandy grasslands. Calcareous soils cannot be restored through shallow ploughing, but deep perturbation could increase the limestone content of the topsoil and Favour of target species.

AB  - Species diversity in sandy grasslands is threatened by decalcification and eutrophication. To determine the most appropriate conditions for red-listed gasteromycete fungi in such grasslands, we investigated their pH preferences in this habitat in southern Sweden. During two winters soil samples were collected from the vicinity of mycelia of these species. Chemical analysis revealed that none of the fungi occurred in sandy habitats with a pH lower than 5, although pH values between 4 and 5 are very common in sandy grasslands in the area. We found niche differentiation within the genus Tulostoma in that two out of four species occurred mainly in soils with high lime content, while one had a broad niche and one occurred mainly in soils low in lime and with a pH below 7.5. Also in the genus Geastrum, some species occurred at high lime content, while most Geastrum as well as two Disciseda species preferred soils with only low amounts of lime. We conclude that many species prefer areas with neutral to slightly acid soil. The results were compared with data for key plant species collected in a previous study of calcareous sandy grasslands and this showed that these in general had a wider pH range than the studied fungi. The results highlight the importance of varying pH levels in protected areas and that the transition zone between lime-containing topsoil and complete decalcification is a preferred environment for many red-listed fungi as well as plants.

AB  - Quantifying the beta diversity ( species replacement along spatiotemporal gradients) of ecosystems is important for understanding and conserving patterns of biodiversity. However, virtually all studies of beta diversity focus on one-dimensional transects orientated along a specific environmental gradient that is defined a priori. By ignoring a second spatial dimension and the associated changes in species composition and environmental gradients, this approach may provide limited insight into the full pattern of beta diversity. Here, we use remotely sensed imagery to quantify beta diversity continuously, in two dimensions, and at multiple scales across an entire tropical marine seascape. We then show that beta diversity can be modeled ( 0.852 >= r(2) >= 0.590) at spatial scales between 0.5 and 5.0 km(2), using the environmental variables of mean and variance of depth and wave exposure. Beta diversity, quantified within a "window'' of a given size, is positively correlated to the range of environmental conditions within that window. For example, beta diversity increases with increasing variance of depth. By analyzing such relationships across seascapes, this study provides a framework for a range of disparate coral reef literature including studies of zonation, diversity, and disturbance. Using supporting evidence from soft-bottom communities, we hypothesize that depth will be an important variable for modeling beta diversity in a range of marine systems. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of marine reserves.

AB  - Species traits have been identified as a component of biodiversity that is worthy of investigation as a tool for exploring ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances. We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation. We advocate inclusion of species-trait variables that may affect ecosystem-level ecological processes in environmental assessment studies because a better understanding of trait-mediated ecological functioning should facilitate assessment of the ecological consequences of anthropogenic perturbations of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - In this work the aim was to determine how carbon sequestration in the growing stock of trees in Finland is dependent on the forest management and increased production potential due to climate change. This was analysed for the period 2003-2053 using forest inventory data and the forestry model MELA. Four combinations of two climate change and two management scenarios were studied: current (CU) and gradually warming (CC) climate and forest management strategies corresponding to different rates of utilisation of the cutting potential, namely maximum sustainable removal (Sust) or maximum net present value (NPV) of wood production (Max). In this analysis of Finland, the initial amount of carbon in the growing stock was 765 Mt (2,802 Tg CO(2)). At the end of the simulation, the carbon in the growing stock of trees in Finland had increased to 894 Mt (3,275 Tg CO(2)) under CUSust, 906 Mt (3,321 Tg CO(2)) under CUMax, 1,060 Mt (3,885 Tg CO(2)) under CCSust and 1,026 Mt (3,758 Tg CO(2)) under CCMax. The results show that future development of carbon in the growing stock is not only dependent on climate change scenarios but also on forest management. For example, maximising the NPV of wood production without sustainability constraints results, over the short term, in a large amount of wood obtained in regeneration cuttings and a consequent decrease in the amount of carbon in growing stock. Over the longer term, this decrease in the carbon of growing stock in regenerated forests is compensated by the subsequent increase in fast-growing young forests. By comparison, no drastic short-term decrease in carbon stock was found in the Sust scenarios; only minor decreases were observed.

AB  - European Union countries provide substantial subsidies for farmland afforestation. Most of the research so far has focused on contribution of afforestation to carbon sequestration, afforestation schemes' uptake, social and economic efficiency and their impact on local biodiversity. Less attention has been given so far to the relevant performance of subsidy schemes' specific design in climate change adaptation, an emerging policy objective. This paper investigates adaptive capacity of subsidised afforestation projects in a Central European country. Subsidies are found to be concentrated primarily to highland regions that already have got high forest cover, with Norway spruce as the preferred tree species and a deficit of European beech, an arrangement that may undermine the payment scheme's contribution to land use adaptation to climate change. Lack of clear policy objectives and related technical subsidy design, rather than appropriation towards competing policy goals, appear to be the ultimate reason behind spatial distribution and structure of subsidised projects. Subsidy spending seems to follow recipients' choices instead of any deliberate policy priorities. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The success of plant breeding in the coming years will be associated with access to new sources of variation, which will include landraces and wild relatives of crop species. In order to access the reservoir of favourable alleles within wild germplasm, knowledge about the genetic diversity and the population structure of wild species is needed. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is one of the most important wild crops growing in the forests of Northern European countries, noted for its nutritional properties and its beneficial effects on human health. Assessment of the genetic diversity of wild bilberry germplasm is needed for efforts such as in situ conservation, on-farm management and development of plant breeding programmes. However, to date, only a few local (small-scale) genetic studies of this species have been performed. We therefore conducted a study of genetic variability within 32 individual samples collected from different locations in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany, and analysed genetic diversity among geographic groups. Four selected inter-simple sequence repeat primers allowed the amplification of 127 polymorphic loci which, based on analysis of variance, made it possible to identify 85 % of the genetic diversity within studied bilberry populations, being in agreement with the mixed-mating system of bilberry. Significant correlations were obtained between geographic and genetic distances for the entire set of samples. The analyses also highlighted the presence of a north-south genetic gradient, which is in accordance with recent findings on phenotypic traits of bilberry.

AB  - Global and local climate changes could disturb carbon sequestration and carbon stocks in forest soils. Thus, it is important to characterize the stability of soil organic matter and the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions in forest ecosystems. This study had two aims: (1) to evaluate the effects of altitude and vegetation on the content of labile and stabile forms of organic carbon in the mountain soils; and (2) to assess the impact of the properties of soil organic matter on the SOC pools under changing environmental conditions. The studies were conducted in the Karkonosze Mountains (SW Poland, Central Europe). The content of the most labile fraction of carbon (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) decreases with altitude, but the content of fulvic acids (FA), clearly increases in the zone above 1000 m asl, while the stabile fraction (humins, non-hydrolyzing carbon) significantly decreases. A higher contribution of stabile forms was found in soils under coniferous forests (Norway spruce), while a smaller - under deciduous forests (European beech) and on grasslands. The expected climate change and the ongoing land use transformations in the zone above 1000 m asl may lead to a substantial increase in the stable humus fraction (mainly of a non-hydrolyzing carbon) and an increase in the SOC pools, even if humus acids are characterized by a lower maturity and greater mobility favorable to soil podzolization. In the lower zone (below 1000 m asl), a decrease in the most stable humus forms can be expected, accompanied by an increase of DOC contribution, which will result in a reduction in SOC pools. Overall, the expected prevailing (spatial) effect is a decreasing contribution of the most stable humus fractions, which will be associated with a reduction in the SOC pools in medium-high mountains of temperate zone of Central Europe.

AB  - We compared the avifauna in two cities, Quebec (Canada) and Rennes (France), in order to define general responses of wildlife in an urban ecosystem. These cities have a similar urban structure that permits investigation along an urbanization gradient from downtown to rural residential areas. However, they are in opposite temperate climate and imbedded in a forested and an agricultural landscape, respectively. Plots ranging from 10 to 20 ha were surveyed in winter and spring by recording all birds seen or heard. Most plots could be located along a gradient according to proportions of vegetated open space. Both the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices of diversity indicated a pattern of increasing diversity from most to least urbanized areas in spring. Winter species diversity and richness was low in Quebec compared to Rennes, reflecting the much harsher winter conditions in Quebec. Breeding densities of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were quite similar in Quebec and Rennes, as were densities of European Blackbirds (Turdus merula) and its ecological equivalent in Quebec, the American Robin (Turdus migratorius). The type of surrounding landscape can not explain the Variation of species numbers within the city. If we examine the urban environment as a new ecological system rather than a degraded environment, we can regroup birds in two major species groups: the omnivorous species adapted to the urban environment and its particular food resources such as garbage and the species that find, in the urban environment, resources which they normally exploit in their usual habitat.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain an important field of agricultural research. Apart from measuring, simulations are frequently used to investigate management impacts on GHG emissions. The HOLOS model has been developed (using country specific emission factors) to explore potential mitigation practices with respect to GHG emission reduction or increased carbon storage. However, avoided GHG emissions can create nutrient surpluses, and thus other environmental hazards (e.g. for human and/or ecosystem health). We propose to expand the Virtual Farm concept by connecting the budgets carbon, nitrogen, and energy flows, and thus estimate environmental impacts as a function of management choices, environment, and climate influence. Initial tests to combine HOLOS with the carbon model Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) in Norway have been promising. The approach will be further developed for Canadian farming systems, based on a minimum of required input data, but with the option of using specific inputs if the data are available.

AB  - Land management is known to have consequences for biodiversity; however, our synthetic understanding of its effects is limited due to highly variable results across studies, which vary in the focal taxa and spatial grain considered, as well as the response variables reported. Such synthetic knowledge is necessary for management of agroecosystems for high diversity and function. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the importance of scale-dependent effects of land management (LM) (pastures vs. meadows), on plant and soil microbe diversity (fungi and bacteria) across 5 study sites in Central Germany. Analyses included diversity partitioning of species richness and related biodiversity components (i.e., density of individuals, species-abundance distribution, and spatial aggregation) at two spatial grains (alpha- and gamma-scale, 1 m(2)and 16 km(2), respectively). Our results show scale-dependent patterns in response to LM to be the norm rather than the exception and highlight the importance of measuring species richness and its underlying components at multiple spatial grains. Our outcomes provide new insight to the complexity of scale-dependent responses within and across taxonomic groups. They suggest that, despite close associations between taxa, LM responses are not easily extrapolated across multiple spatial grains and taxa. Responses of biodiversity to LM are often driven by changes to evenness and spatial aggregation, rather than by changes in individual density. High-site specificity of LM effects might be due to a variety of context-specific factors, such as historic land management, identity of grazers, and grazing regime. Synthesis and applications:Our results suggest that links between taxa are not necessarily strong enough to allow for generalization of biodiversity patterns. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple taxa and spatial grains when investigating LM responses, while promoting management practices that do the same and are tailored to local and regional conditions.

AB  - Although forest stands represent 47% of the total land area in Europe, alterations to the forest habitat through logging and plantation of exotic trees has led to significant changes in forest biocenoses. Due to their peculiar biology and life history, epiphytic bryophytes, which include a number of species of high conservation value, are especially concerned. Ordinal logit regression was used to test whether trends in diversity and abundance of obligate epiphytic bryophytes are explained by forest cover and spruce plantation and determine specific optima and degree of reliance to these factors at the landscape scale. Spruce plantations had a negative impact on both species diversity and abundance. Although large forest patches were important for a set of species exclusively or more frequently occurring under the forest cover, the abundance of a number of species previously identified as woodland bryophytes decreased or was uncorrelated with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, the species pool adapted to edge-related abiotic conditions was important. The global epiphytic diversity did consequently not decrease with decreasing forest cover at the landscape scale. If large forest patches are important for the conservation of a set of species exclusively or more frequently occurring under the forest cover, the conservation of epiphytic bryophytes thus also involves the conservation of pioneer trees in open landscapes. A series of management measures, which may help maximize the species diversity and probability of occurrence of key-species of high conservation interest, are proposed.

AB  - Diversity of vegetation in managed forests is studied. A classification based on forest stand structure, the abundances of vegetation species and variations in these abundances is developed and diversity indices are calculated for the classes to describe the diversity of the vegetation within the classes. The classes were formed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), global nonmetric multidimensional scaling (GNMDS) and TWINSPAN classification. Discriminant analysis was used to determine the environmental variables differentiating between the classes, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to examine the ability of the diversity measures to distinguish the classes. Beta diversity was estimated with Okland's method based on DCA ordination of the sample plots. The results point to fertility and the successional stage of the stand as the main factors affecting species diversity, in addition to which soil type, the number of tree species, crown cover, basal area and certain variables describing the management of the stand were relevant to the classification. The most distinct diversity indices were the reciprocal of Simpson, Pielou's J' and species richness, while the highest alpha diversity was found in young stands with a low crown cover on herb-rich or mesic forest sites. Beta diversity was quite high, its highest values of all for the whole data being recorded along the fertility gradient.

AB  - The identity and composition of the overstorey trees can have large impacts on the understorey vegetation in temperate forests. Here, we assess the effects of the conversion of mixed deciduous forests to Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations on the understorey vegetation composition and diversity. We also investigated whether the effects of this conversion depend on the soil fertility and if they affect the species pool at the landscape scale. The study area contained ancient deciduous woodlands mainly consisting of Quercus spp., Fagus sylvatica and Carpinus betulus in the Gaume, an area with a mild temperate climate in southern Belgium. Spruce plantations were established 30-50 years ago in this matrix of deciduous woodlands. Differences in overstorey and understorey vegetation, forest floor and soil characteristics between 40 paired plots in spruce plantations and adjacent deciduous forest were compared along a soil fertility gradient. The forest floor mass was higher and the soil pH was lower in spruce plantations. The composition of the understorey vegetation differed between deciduous forest and spruce plantations: the spruce stands contained more light-demanding and acid-tolerant understorey species than the adjacent deciduous stands. The mean understorey species diversity, i.e., the local species diversity in a plot (a-diversity) as well as the total number of species (gamma-diversity), did not differ significantly between the deciduous and spruce stands. Hence, the differing species composition of the spruce plantations contributes to a larger overall species pool and higher across site beta-diversity. Although the differences in the environmental variables within a plot pair increased along the fertility gradient, the differences in understorey vegetation diversity between deciduous and spruce stands showed no relationship with the gradient. Only the difference in Ellenberg indicator value for soil reaction (R) within a pair increased with increasing soil fertility. In line with the abiotic changes, the understorey vegetation composition had shifted towards a more acid-tolerant vegetation type 30-50 years after conversion to spruce plantations. The increase in light-demanding species was probably due to a more intensive thinning management in the spruce stands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the resistance of nature to trampling and path erosion in Koli National Park. The data are based on 201 field measurements of paths together with digital datasets in order to identify the main factors affecting path erosion. Additionally, the resistance of different forest types to trampling was studied. Models for path erosion were constructed in order to predict the width and depth of a path. Slope of the path and the number of visitors were the two main factors explaining width and depth. The lowest resistance areas were identified in rocky-site forest located on the hilltops, while the deepest paths were on moraine soils. Paths on meadows were highly resistant to trampling and the most resistance forest type was Oxalis-Myrtillus. The results of this study can be applied in national park management and can be the basis for the design of measures to reduce path erosion. By mapping the most sensitive areas, the path network can be planned to be sustainable. Recreational pressure can be redirected to more resistant areas or structures such as duckboard and stairs can be built to protect the most sensitive areas. Developed models can be used for testing where to place new paths in order to minimize path erosion.

AB  - Aim Assessing long-term (1992-2009) trends of littoral invertebrate and phytoplankton metacommunities in boreal lakes with emphasis on separating the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity. Deriving implications for regional biodiversity conservation and management, based on a data-intensive approach with high ecological realism. Location Sweden (Northern Europe). Methods A recently published method was used to partition beta diversity into species turnover and nestedness components. Regression analyses were used to test for monotonic temporal change of these diversity fractions through time. Associations between the temporal diversity patterns of taxonomic groups and environmental variables were studied using correlation analyses. Results Turnover of both metacommunities increased monotonically over the study period, while nestedness decreased. In invertebrates, these changes correlated mainly with regional changes in acidity, while phytoplankton responded more to changing water clarity. Nestedness and turnover patterns were inversely correlated in both groups, but neither turnover nor nestedness was correlated between invertebrates and phytoplankton. Nestedness of both groups explained a lower percentage of the partitioned variance compared with turnover. Main conclusion Results suggest that all lakes contribute more equally to regional diversity over time and are, as a result, all potential targets of management actions. Not only is a regional conservation strategy logistically difficult, it is also a financially expensive expectation.

AB  - Aims
   Knowledge of genetic structure of natural populations and its determinants may provide key insights into the ability of species to adapt to novel environments. In many genetic studies, the effects of climate could not be disentangled from the effects of geographic proximity. We aimed to understand the effects of temperature and moisture on genetic diversity of populations and separate these effects from the effects of geographic distance. We also wanted to explore the patterns of distribution of genetic diversity in the system and assess the degree of clonality within the populations. We also checked for possible genome size variation in the system.
   Methods
   We studied genetic variation within and among 12 populations of the dominant grass Festuca rubra distributed across a unique regional-scale climatic grid in western Norway, Europe and explored the importance of temperature, precipitation and geographic distance for the observed patterns. We also explored the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations, identified population differentiation and estimated degree of clonality. The analyses used microsatellites as the genetic marker. The analyses were supplemented by flow cytometry of all the material.
   Important Findings
   All the material corresponds to hexaploid cytotype, indicating that ploidy variation does not play any role in the system. The results indicate that temperature and precipitation were better predictors of genetic relatedness of the populations than geographic distance, suggesting that temperature and precipitation may be important determinants of population differentiation. In addition, precipitation, alone and in interaction with temperature, strongly affected population genotypic diversity suggesting increased clonality towards the coldest and especially the coldest wettest climates. At the same time, individuals from the coldest and wettest climates also had the highest individual genetic diversity, suggesting that only the most heterozygous individuals survive under these harsh climates. Most of the genetic variation was distributed within populations, suggesting that most populations have sufficient genetic diversity to adapt to novel climatic conditions. The alpine populations, i.e. populations which are likely the most endangered by climate change, however, lack this potential due to the high levels of clonality as detected in our study.

AB  - The effects of logging on wood-decomposing Basidiomycetes were studied in the boreal forests in northern Finland. The study area consisted of pine forest sites felled 3, 18 and 42 years before our study. The species composition of fungi in cut plots was compared to that of uncut old-growth forest sites. Altogether, 47 species were recorded on 570 logs. The species compositions reflected the amount and quality of coarse woody debris (CWD) available in the stands. In the old-growth stands, the species diversity was high, but the distribution of fungi was strongly affected by the patchy occurrence of CWD. Pioneer white-rot fungi predominated in the 3-year old logging sites. In the 40-year old logging sites, the number of species on the logging waste was 50-60% lower than in the old-growth forests, but the residual CWD from the pre-logging time still hosted a large portion of the species of the virgin forests. The species regarded as old-growth forest indicators showed different ecological tolerance to the effects of logging: the majority was confined only to naturally produced CWD, while some species were able to invade logging waste. The results showed that some polypores known to prefer old-gowth forest habitats can survive for decades in managed forests. However, the species diversity of lignicolous fungi after logging greatly depended on the availability and diversity of decaying wood created before the management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The challenge of multi-use forestry is to fulfil a range of economic, ecologic and social goals in a sustainable way, accounting for synergies and trade-offs among the ecosystem services provided. Climate changes add to the complexity via effects on forest ecosystem processes, such as primary production and respiration, and also by adding a new goal on the agenda: the role of forests in climate mitigation. In recent years, the generation of climate model projections, representing a range of future scenarios, has enabled the development of strategic decisions in relation to risk management, and created a demand for cross-sectorial adaptation and mitigation processes. In this ecosystem model study we address these issues from the perspective of Swedish forest owners, by focusing on climate impacts and forest management effects on the potential harvest level, net income, predisposition to storm damage, biodiversity and carbon storage. The objective was to evaluate alternative management strategies, applicable to northern boreal, southern boreal and nemoral conditions. A general finding is that targeted combinations of forest stand management strategies can lead to a higher degree of goal fulfilment at the landscape level than current forest management practice.

AB  - Even though marine protected areas (MPAs) have become central instruments in the endeavour towards sustainable development, our knowledge on how different institutional designs influence outcomes is limited. Using a comparative case study design, this paper explores the interplay between institutional arrangements and management outcomes in two adjacent yet institutionally slightly differing MPAs, encompassing a shared marine trench and a partially inhabited archipelago landscape namely the Koster Sea National Park in Sweden and the Outer Hvaler National Park in Norway. How can differences in the institutional designs governing the two parks, be linked to differences in sustainability outcomes? What lessons can be learnt for the design of MPAs? The study shows that institutional design influences management outcomes in some respects but not in others. Differences in overall management systems had no noticeable effects on sustainability outcomes and how they were perceived, while the differing objectives of the parks and how they are made operational seem to have affected the outcomes. But they have also influenced actors' expectations and their assessment of outcomes. According to this study, conservation arrangements can be broadened beyond mere nature protection. However, the study also underlines the challenges of locally adapted and participatory institutional designs and emphasises the importance of taking users' varying expectations related to social and economic values into account throughout the whole process. The establishment of national parks is no guarantee for broader sustainable development per se; this also requires resources and proper embedding and integration with relevant sectors and tiers in the overall management system.

AB  - The mineralization of carbon and nutrients by the decomposing fungi and bacteria has an essential role in the ecosystem functioning. Strong correlations between soil fertility, plant nutrient uptake and primary productivity also make the soil processes important with respect of the land use. I have studied the effect of reindeer grazing on the soil processes in northern-boreal forests and arctic tundra heaths in several sites in northern Finland and Norway. I have compared the effect of grazing in different vegetation types and in areas of different grazing intensity. In boreal forests reindeer grazing retards carbon mineralization in both lichen- and dwarf-shrub dominated forests. In lichen-dominated forests, however, reindeer grazing enhances nitrogen mineralization, depending on soil moisture and weather conditions, as during dry summers the low soil moisture content may limit the microbial activity. Nutrient mineralization may therefore be enhanced or retarded by reindeer grazing and this may vary in different years. In arctic tundra heaths, the effect of reindeer grazing depends on the vegetation and the soil carbon storage. Reindeer grazing enhanced carbon mineralization in sub-oceanic, dwarf-shrub dominated tundra heaths, whereas it did not affect it in sub-continental, lichen dominated tundra heaths. Soil nitrogen availability was nevertheless improved by reindeer grazing in both vegetation types. In another arctic study area, however, carbon mineralization and microbial biomass was decreased by grazing. This was interpreted to depend on small carbon storage in soil.

AB  - Pure spruce stands are unsatisfactory, especially from the ecological point of view. Therefore, attempts are being made to convert these into mixed forests by planting groups of beech under the canopy of the spruce forests. In this study the invertebrate fauna of such 20 and 40-year-old beech groups, pure spruce stands and deciduous stands are compared to see how far the young beech groups have already influenced the coenosis of spruce forests. The analysis was based upon 3 ecological guilds: Saprophagous macroinvertebrates, epigeic predators and predators of the trunk area. The study shows that while spruce stands are not barren deserts, they do contain less species and individuals than deciduous stands. As a result, the reconversion of spruce forests remains an important task in forest management. The beech groups are species richer than the spruce stands. However, the tree species are not the only important factor, the structure and the size of the groups are also of significance. Furthermore, other tree species such as Quercus, Via, Acer and Fraxinus as well as successional tree species may possibly promote diversity and accelerate the improvement of soil quality.

AB  - What drives ecosystem buildup, diversity, and stability? We assess species arrival and ecosystem changes across 16 millennia by combining regional-scale plant sedimentary ancient DNA from Fennoscandia with near-complete DNA and trait databases. We show that postglacial arrival time varies within and between plant growth forms. Further, arrival times were mainly predicted by adaptation to temperature, disturbance, and light. Major break points in ecological trait diversity were seen between 13.9 and 10.8 calibrated thousand years before the present (cal ka BP), as well as break point in functional diversity at 12.0 cal ka BP, shifting from a state of ecosystem buildup to a state where most habitat types and biotic ecosystem components were in place. Trait and functional diversity stabilized around 8 cal ka BP, after which both remained stable, although changes in climate took place and species inflow continued. Our ecosystem reconstruction indicates a millennial-scale time phase of formation to reach stable and resilient levels of diversity and functioning.

AB  - Partial harvesting of forest for biofuel and other products may be less harmful to biodiversity than clear-cutting, and may even be beneficial for some species or groups of organisms such as herbs. There are, however, few well-controlled experiments evaluating positive and negative effects, such as species losses directly after harvest. In closed canopy mixed oak forest in Sweden, about 25% of the tree basal area and 50-90% of the understory was removed (mainly spruce, birch, aspen, lime, rowan and hazel). In each of six forests, we studied herbs in an experimental (cutting) plot and a control plot (undisturbed) before, and in the first summer, after the harvest (conducted in winter). Losses of species were similar in experimental and control plots (15-16%). The harvest increased species richness by 4-31% (mean 18%); also species diversity (H) increased. Several ruderals increased in experimental plots, but most changes occurred in grassland and forest species; partial cutting led to complex, partly unpredictable early changes in the herb community. A review of early effects of partial cutting (eight experiments) indicated that it increases herb species richness in stands of broadleaves, but apparently not in conifer stands; there was no evidence that partial cutting increases species losses. Thus, with respect to early changes after harvest, we found no negative effects of partial cutting on herbs. We suggest, however, that some proportion of closed-canopy mixed oak forest should not be harvested, to protect rare, potentially sensitive herbs, and to create stand diversity.

AB  - Testate amoebae represent a crucial component of soil microfauna and have been studied extensively in ombrotrophic peatlands. However, little is known about their ecology in moorlands which are important habitats in terms of biodiversity and carbon storage potential. Moorlands are under threat from a range of factors such as drainage, burning, over grazing, pollution and climate change. In this study we investigate testate amoebae communities within three zones of a UK moorland characterised by contrasting fire histories, and use these data to examine the potential of testate amoebae as environmental bioindicators in moorlands. Although several factors control testate amoebae communities in moorlands, it is clear that there are marked differences in testate amoebae communities between the zones which primarily relate to hydrological status, influenced by fire regime. The taxon Hyalosphenia subflava is a clear indicator of severe disturbance as it was found to be abundant in mosses which colonised a hydrophobic peat surface following a severe wild-fire event. Testate amoebae have much potential for ecosystem monitoring of moorlands which can inform sustainable land management practices. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detailed information on spatial patterns of tree species diversity (TSD) is essential for biodiversity assessment, forest disturbance monitoring, and the management and conservation of forest resources. TSD mapping ap-proaches based on the Spectral Variability Hypothesis (SVH) could provide a reliable alternative to image classification methods. However, such methods have not been tested in large-scale TSD mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. In this study, we developed a new workflow for large-scale TSD mapping in an approximately 4000 km2 temperate montane forest using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery-based heterogeneity metrics and topographic data. Through a systematic comparison of model performance in 24 prediction scenarios with different combinations of input variables, and a correlation analysis between six image heterogeneity metrics and two in-situ TSD indicators (species richness S and Shannon-Wiener diversity H '), we assessed the effects of vegetation phenology, image heterogeneity metrics, and sensor type on the accuracy of TSD pre-dictions. Our results show that (1) the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery produced higher ac-curacy of TSD predictions compared to the Sentinel-2 data alone, and that the further inclusion of topographic data yielded the highest accuracy (S: R2 = 0.562, RMSE = 1.502; H ': R2 = 0.628, RMSE = 0.231); (2) both Multi -Temporal and Spectral-Temporal-Metric data capture phenology-related information of tree species and signif-icantly improved the accuracy of TSD predictions; (3) texture metrics outperformed other image heterogeneity metrics (i.e., Coefficient of Variation, Rao's Q, Convex Hull Volume, Spectral Angle Mapper, and the Convex Hull Area), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived image heterogeneity metrics were most effective in predicting TSD; and (4) the spatial distribution of TSD showed a clear decrease trend along the altitudinal gradient (r = -0.61 for S and -0.45 for H ') and varied significantly among forest types. Our results suggest a good potential of the SVH-based approaches combined with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data for large-scale TSD mapping in temperate montane forests. The TSD maps generated in our study will be valuable for forest biodiversity assessments and for developing management and conservation measures.

AB  - This study compares the succession of understorey vegetation at semi-natural and managed mesic sites dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The area concerned is situated in the middle boreal forest zone on both sides of the border between Finland and Russia. The data were collected at 39 sites representing open/burned, sapling, young, mature and over-mature/old-growth forests. The coverage and number of species representing ground lichens, mosses, liverworts, grasses, herbs, dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings were recorded and analysed separately. The vegetation represented different stages of the succession and management history (managed versus semi-natural).
   The vegetation was ordered along two multivariate (DCA) axes, the first related to successional stage and the second to human influence. The total number of plant species was dependent on the successional stage and the diversity pattern was similar both after semi-natural and man-made disturbance. The plant life-form groups exhibited specific patterns in their occurrence and in their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The coverage of grasses and dwarf shrubs, in particular, followed quite different patterns after man-made and natural disturbances. Grasses were abundant in managed forests after clear-cutting, but almost absent from young natural forests, while dwarf shrubs occurred more commonly in the old managed forests than in the younger ones. The coverage of seedlings in semi-natural forests peaked in the sapling stage, decreased towards the mature stage and increased again in the old-growth stage, while tree recruitment was relatively low in the older managed successional stages. The results highlight especially the characteristic vegetation features of young natural forests, which differ considerably from the corresponding managed forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Species-rich, semi-natural meadows in Finland are threatened. During the last century most of them have either been abandoned or changed into cultivated fields. This has resulted in a collapse of species and habitat diversity of the Finnish agricultural landscape. In this study, we tried to define the present state of inland semi-natural meadows on mineral soil in North Ostrobothnia and in immediate vicinity. We compared the material gathered in national inventory of traditional rural biotopes in Finland with two data sets from the beginning of the last century to find out how does the detected species composition correspond to vegetation types established by two early researchers, A. K. Cajander and K. Terasvuori. The studied meadows' species composition differs markedly from the meadow types described earlier. Present-day meadows are characterized by several nitrophilous species indicating that modern type of management, where supplementary forage is provided for grazing animals, causes eutrophication. Because the open meadows in North Ostrobothnia are in such a poor condition, - eutrophication and resulting low species diversity - the protection of semi-natural habitats more typical of the coastal areas, e.g. seashore meadows, in particular, should be emphasized.

AB  - The epiphytic lichens on basal trunks of old Salix caprea trees were surveyed in five areas in the southern boreal and two areas in the middle boreal forests of Finland. A total of 104 lichen species were found on the 125 trees sampled, 75 species in the southern and 91 species in the middle boreal areas. Epiphyte cover, including both lichens and bryophytes, was recorded on two sample plots on each tree. The epiphyte flora was dominated by widespread generalist species (Hypogymnia physodes, Parmelia sulcata, Parmeliopsis ambigua, Platismatia glauca), but also some specialist species were found (Arthonia incarnata, Lobaria scrobiculata, Rinodina cinereovirens). The average number of lichen species per tree was lower (19 species) in the southern boreal than in the middle boreal areas (25 species), with some exceptionally high values (max. 38) in the latter area. Total epiphyte diversity was also higher in the middle boreal areas. It is suggested that the lichen diversity is best explained by high micro-habitat heterogeneity on the trunks, a bark structure favourable for lichen colonization and a mass dispersal effect from adjacent habitats. Disturbance caused by the frequent scaling of the basal bark is probably an important contributing factor. The structure of the epiphyte vegetation was analysed using DCA ordination. The substantial between-tree variation in the data was best explained by differences in the climate between the southern and middle boreal areas, the inclination of the trunk and the small-scale variation in the microhabitat structure of the trunk. The study shows that old Salix caprea trees are important components from the point of view of conserving epiphytic lichen diversity in the boreal forests of Fennoscandia.

Three adult individuals were caught in spruce bark beetle pipe traps during the consecutive time periods of 22.V-22.VI.2006, 21.VII-22.VIII.2006 and 23.VII-25.VIII.2008 at a site that had been burnt for restoration purposes on 7.VII.2005. A. laeviusculus had been considered to be an extinct species in Finland until one specimen was found in Koli National Park in 1996. Here we discuss the possibility that slash-and-burn and restoration burn treatments may sustain the continuum of post-fire habitats essential for the A. laeviusculus population.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is widely believed to promote environmentally responsible behavior. However, based on qualitative interviews with trekkers in Jotunheimen National Park, a mountainous area in Norway, this study questions that notion. The study finds that environmentally responsible behavior is preconditioned by reflection on the relationship between people and nature, and that outdoor recreation alone does not necessarily promote reflection. The results suggest that it is important to distinguish between outdoor recreation and reflection on the human-nature relationship, where only the latter is related to environmentally responsible behavior.

AB  - Fulufjallet, with an area of 385 km(2), was recently designated Sweden's 28th national park. This article describes how the park establishment process turned negative local opinion positive. The basis for success was a shift of focus from restrictions inside the boundaries of the national park to opportunities outside. This "inside out" process implies a new approach to area protection and local community participation in Sweden. This is in line with the contemporary Swedish nature conservation strategy based on the principle of sustainability, which takes account of both ecological and socioeconomic development in a district.

AB  - Marine fish farming is a relatively new component in the complex mixture of coastal resource uses in north temperate zone countries. In Western Canada, the Province of British Columbia issues site and operational licences for marine fish farms. Before granting licenses, staff evaluate fish farm applications for their technical feasibility as part of a conflict resolution process. This ensures that aquaculture develops in an environmentally responsible manner, and is part of a public accountability process that recognises the interests of conflicting marine resource users. A referral system which solicits input from national and local organisations is part of this licensing process. The Norwegian process for ordering salmon farming industry development involves partitioning the coast at a national level and developing organic loading maxima for each section of the coast. Within the constraints of this national plan local authorities license aquaculture. This paper describes these different approaches and compares their strengths and weaknesses.

AB  - Aim Plant and arthropod diversity are often related, but data on the role of mature tree diversity on canopy insect communities are fragmentary. We compare species richness of canopy beetles across a tree diversity gradient ranging from mono-dominant beech to mixed stands within a deciduous forest, and analyse community composition changes across space and time.
   Location Germany's largest exclusively deciduous forest, the Hainich National Park (Thuringia).
   Methods We used flight interception traps to assess the beetle fauna of various tree species, and applied additive partitioning to examine spatiotemporal patterns of diversity.
   Results Species richness of beetle communities increased across the tree diversity gradient from 99 to 181 species per forest stand. Intra-and interspecific spatial turnover among trees contributed more than temporal turnover among months to the total gamma-beetle diversity of the sampled stands. However, due to parallel increases in the number of habitat generalists and the number of species in each feeding guild (herbivores, predators and fungivores), no proportional changes in community composition could be observed. If only beech trees were analysed across the gradient, patterns were similar but temporal (monthly) species turnover was higher compared to spatial turnover among trees and not related to tree diversity.
   Main conclusions The changes in species richness and community composition across the gradient can be explained by habitat heterogeneity, which increased with the mix of tree species. We conclude that understanding temporal and spatial species turnover is the key to understanding biodiversity patterns. Mono-dominant beech stands are insufficient to conserve fully the regional species richness of the remaining semi-natural deciduous forest habitats in Central Europe, and analysing beech alone would have resulted in the misleading conclusion that temporal (monthly) turnover contributes more to beetle diversity than spatial turnover among different tree species or tree individuals.

AB  - Tree species and forest age are two key variables affecting timber production and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems. In this study, in Jiangxi province of eastern China, by a thorough investigation of 179 subtropical forest stands in a 16.7 x 10(6) ha area with similar climatic conditions and past land-use history, we systematically examined biomass of live aboveground tree, forest floor litter, shrub and herb as well as soil organic carbon (SOC) content (0-10, 10-30 and 30-100 cm depths) to compare differences among five major vegetation types (Chinese fir, masson pine, single-species broadleaves, mixed conifers-broadleaves, and mixed-species broadleaves), and between age classes (below vs above 30 years of stand age). Tree species and stand age both had significant effects. Among the five forest types, mixed-species broadleaved forests had remarkably highest timber productivity, SOC content and storage in the 0-100 cm depth and total C store in the age group of above 30 years. Coniferous stands had generally higher forest floor biomass than broadleaved stands in the age group of below 30 years; this trend was opposite for mineral soil C in the age group of above 30 years. Stand age significantly affected aboveground timber production for all the tree species; this effect was weaker on belowground soil C, as broadleaves exhibited increases in SOC content with stand age while conifers did not. Our results suggest that long-term continuity ( > 30 years) of mixed-species broadleaves could be an optimal strategy for forests in subtropical region of China. This study contributes to a better understanding of the effects of management practices on forest ecosystems.

AB  - Lately there has been a shift in Sweden from grazing species-rich semi-natural grasslands towards grazing ex-arable fields in the modern agricultural landscape. These fields normally contain a fraction of the plant species richness compared to semi-natural grasslands. However, small remnant habitats have been suggested as important for plant species diversity and conservation as they may function as refugia for grassland specialists in fragmented and highly modified agricultural landscapes. In this study, we examined whether plant communities on small remnant habitats, i.e. midfield islets, can function as sources for grassland species to disperse out into surrounding grazed ex-fields (former arable fields). We examined species richness and grassland specialists (species favoured by grazing) and their ability to colonize fields after 5 and 11 years of grazing. The fields that had been grazed for a shorter time were fairly species-poor with few grassland specialists. A longer period of grazing had a positive effect on total and small-scale species diversity in both islets and fields. Species composition became more similar with time, and the number of grassland specialists in both habitats increased. We found that grassland specialists dispersed step-wise into the fields, and the number of grassland specialists decreased with distance from the source. Our study suggests that remnant habitats, such as midfield islets, do function as a source community for grassland specialists and enhance diversification of grassland species when grazing is introduced. For long-term conservation of plant species, incorporating small refugia. into larger grazing complexes may thus enhance species richness. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ley cultivation by ploughing and fertilising constitute a severe impact on plant community patterns in semi-natural subalpine communities. Since the 1950ties, such cultivation have been an important part of the agroecosystem in subalpine areas in Norway, and regularly practised. Today, several former leys are left for grazing management. Plant species diversity and heterogeneity was studied in subalpine grasslands in Valdres, southern Norway (ca. 950 m a.s.l.) at different successional phases after ploughing. Fourteen sites (100 m(2)) varying from recently ploughed grasslands (3-5 years at phase 1) to unploughed sites were used to construct a temporal gradient by a space for time substitution. Small-scale species diversity (0.25 m(2)) of vascular plants increased continuously with the time since last ploughing, while the variation in gamma-diversity was minor among late successional phases 3-5 (> 23-28 years, 32-39 years and unploughed sites) after an evident increase from phase 1-3. The number of exclusive species peaked within unploughed sites (10), and included perennial herbs (Antennaria alpina, Hieracium auricula, Viola canina), spore-producing species (Botrychium lunaria, Selaginella selaginoides) and woody life-forms. Species diversity of cryptogams was low at both a small and large scale within successional phases 1 and 2 (< 12 years). Small scale cryptogam diversity peaked at the unploughed sites, while gamma diversity peaked at phase 3 (23-28 years). This intermediate phase 3 also had the highest number of exclusive species (12) which exceeded unploughed sites (8). A coarse spatial structure of cryptogams at phase 3 was indicated by a low mean of species distribution. The soil of uncultivated grasslands (phase 5) was, at the end of the growing season (mid August), quite base-rich with a higher content for all measured nutrients as compared to intermediate phases of continuity (phase 3 and 4) The exception was nitrate which was not detectable from phase 3 to 5, and available phosphate which peaked at an intermediate phase of succession (phase 3 and 4). Heterogeneity of vascular plants reached a minimum value at the intermediate phase (3) while cryptogam heterogeneity peaked at this phase. Differences in heterogeneity cycles among these species groups implies that structuring processes act on different temporal scales for vascular plants as compered to cryptogams along the successional gradient in grasslands after ploughing. The importance of continuity in management for plant biodiversity in subalpine grasslands is finally discussed from a conservation point of view.

   Protected area management in Norway is undergoing institutional changes with the implementation of management models aimed at increased public participation. At the same time tourism enterprises are increasing in number within the protected areas. Greater levels of interaction with stakeholders place new demands on lead institutions in terms of communication, transparency, involvement, and power sharing. A governance perspective was used to examine some facets of the interaction between a local council managing a national park in Norway and tourism companies using the park for their operations. The main objective was to assess how the tourism sector perceives the cooperation and interface with the management institution. Semi-structured interviews were used, together with a framework of United Nations Development Programme principles of good governance: legitimacy and voice, direction, performance, accountability, and fairness. The results showed rather negative evaluations by the tourism sector, and operators expressed views, implying that the current management model fails to achieve most of the principles of good governance. Although based on a one-sided view by one group of stakeholders, the study suggests that lack of access to important processes and decisions, perceived bias towards traditional conservation, neglect of cultural heritage, and undue restrictions on access could have serious implications for developing an effective management model.

AB  - Aim The goals of this study were to: (1) compare water conductivity and pH as proxy measures of mineral richness in relation to mollusc assemblages in fens, (2) examine the patterns of mollusc species richness along the gradient of mineral richness based on these factors, (3) model species-response curves and analyse calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of molluscs, and (4) compare the results with those from other studies concerning non-marine mollusc ecology.
   Location Altogether, 135 treeless spring fen sites were sampled within the area of the Western Carpathians (east Czech Republic, north-west Slovakia and south Poland; overall extent of study area was 12,000 km(2)).
   Methods Mollusc communities were recorded quantitatively from a homogeneous area of 16 m(2). Water conductivity and pH were measured in the field. The patterns of local species diversity along selected gradients, and species-response curves, were modelled using generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM), both using the Poisson distribution.
   Results When the most acid sites (practically free of molluscs) were excluded, conductivity expressed the sites' mineral richness and base saturation within the entire gradient, in contrast to pH. In the base-rich sites, pH did not correlate with mineral richness. A unimodal response of local species diversity to mineral richness (expressed as conductivity) was found. In the extremely mineral-rich, tufa-forming sites (conductivity > 600 mu S cm(-1)) a decrease in species diversity was encountered. Response curves of the most common species showed clear differentiation of their niches. Significant models of either unimodal or monotonic form were fitted for 18 of the 30 species analysed. Species showed five types of calcicole-calcifuge behaviour: (1) a decreasing monotonic response curve and a preference for the really acid sites; (2) a skewed unimodal response curve with the optimum shifted towards the slightly acid sites; (3) a symmetrical unimodal model response curve with the optimum in the base-rich sites, with no or slight tufa precipitation; (4) a skewed unimodal response curve but with the optimum shifted to the more mineral-rich sites; and (5) an increasingly monotonic response curve, the optimum in the extremely base-rich sites with strong tufa precipitation.
   Main conclusions Conductivity is the only reliable proxy measure of mineral richness across the entire gradient, within the confines of this study. This information is of great ecological significance in studies of fen mollusc communities. Species richness does not increase with increasing mineral richness along the entire gradient: only a few species are able to dwell in the extremely base-rich sites. The five types of calcicole-calcifuge behaviour seen in species living in fens have a wider application: data published so far suggest they are also applicable to mollusc communities in other habitats.

AB  - Across the globe, conservation has been increasingly in conflict with other human activities. National parks are an important concept in nature protection and probably the most recognized institution in nature tourism worldwide. The concept of sustainable nature tourism became a part of the planning and management of Finnish national parks at the beginning of the new millennium. We analyze the environmental conflict and the idea and practices of sustainable nature tourism from a historical perspective in one Finnish national park: Koli. The main research question is how has the concept of sustainability been used to resolve the conflict between tourism and nature protection? Our perspective is based on the essence of sustainable nature tourism as humanity's interaction with the environment. The main data of the study consists of interviews with park managers and planners and archival material from local newspapers. In Koli, the history of the founding of the park and tourism development were strongly affected by diverse nature relationships between different actors. In the human-nature relationship perspective, it was a matter of how the land was to be utilized, on an anthropocentric or eco-centric basis. From the park management point of view, sustainable nature tourism was a conceptual and practical tool to diffuse the conflict. Experiences in Koli show how eco-utilitarian perspectives toward nature conservation can help to resolve conflict. Today the idea of sustainability has been adapted by large-scale tourism developers and earlier failed vast plans for Koli are alive again, only reconceptualized with the idea of sustainability. This kind of economy-based sustainability in turn pushes the idea of sustainable nature tourism further from nature itself and eco-centric perspectives and provides foundations for a new conflict.

AB  - Wild bees are key ecosystem components making their decline a cause for concern. An effective measure to increase wild bee diversity is to enhance plant diversity. However, the effect on bee diversity of augmenting plant diversity depends on site-specific environmental conditions. We aimed to make spatial predictions of where: (a) environmental conditions maximize bee diversity, so that such areas can be prioritized for augmenting plant diversity; and (b) populations of threatened wild bee species are most likely to occur. We surveyed bee communities in traditionally managed hay meadows in SE Norway and modelled bee diversity as a function of climate, habitat area, and distance to nesting substrates. We used independent data to validate our predictions and found that plant and predicted bee species richness together explained 76% and 69% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness in forested and agricultural ecosystems, respectively. In urban areas, the predicted bee species richness alone explained 31% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness. Using data from online species occurrence records, we found that - compared to species of lower conservation concern - threatened solitary bee species were more typically recorded in areas with a high predicted solitary bee species richness. We show that spatial predictions of bee diversity can identify sites where augmenting plant diversity is likely to be most effective. Maps of predicted bee diversity can guide species surveys and monitoring projects and increase the chances of locating populations of threatened bees.

AB  - This paper addresses the problems in achieving sustainable institutional solutions in the management of fish farming and archipelago fisheries. Institutional sustainability refers to the sets of management rules and the organizations that implement those rules. We study sustainability from environmental, socioeconomic and community perspectives. A special attention was paid to conflict between fish farming and environmental protection. Semistructured interviews with the stakeholders were used as method for data collection. The fish farmers and fishermen possess a strong local identity and feel that the local people support their livelihood. The governance system was considered distant and bureaucratic. The interviewed fish farmers and fishermen were suspicious over the support coming from the state administration and from the EU. They would not necessarily take a turn to self-management but would like to increase communication and authorities' awareness of the fishermen's situation and problems. Both the causes of problems and the paths for sustainable development in the area are often seen in contradictory ways among local fish farmers, leisure dwellers, and environmental officers. There arc no clear-cut means to reach a balance between the socioeconomic, ecological, and community dimensions, but a way forward is to study the options for existing or new institutions to enhance collaboration for better regulation of the conflicts. The aim of spatial planning, when relocating the fish farming sites, should be to balance between different interests and mitigate conflicts in advance and thus create improved legitimacy of the regulation system and acceptability of the decisions. The present system has created a vicious circle, which not only hinders positive development in other dimensions of sustainability than the environmental, but also causes poorer results than it probably would be without the present regulation system. Three main recommendations given in the Finnish AQCESS synthesis for developing the institutional sustainability of fisheries in the study areas are 1) improved definition of goals for state governance; 2) development of cooperation between governance sectors; and 3) development of participatory planning.

AB  - This paper positions mixed methods as a complement to traditional qualitative and quantitative research. It provides an example of conducting mixed methods research by analysing the sociocultural sustainability of tourism as perceived by local stakeholders nearby Oulanka National Park in north-eastern Finland. Semi-structured interviews were linked concurrently to survey data from the same respondents. First, four discourses were identified based on 40 interviews with respondents about tourism development pertinent to the Protected Area Network (PAN) Parks international certification. Second, the differences between the representatives of the discourses were examined using non-parametric statistics. Results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis supplemented each other. The survey results supported the identification of four discourses and provided information about the representatives using the discourses. The discourse groups differed according to length of residence in the area, distance from the park, gender, employment in tourism, familiarity with PAN Parks, benefit from PAN Parks status, belief in the benefits of PAN Parks, satisfaction with tourism and park development, importance of the environmental dimension and satisfaction with various dimensions of sustainability. The study demonstrates that a better understanding of a problem may be acquired by using a mix of survey methods and interviews.

AB  - Bryophytes growing on siliceous boulders (diameter 50-200 cm) were studied in two forests in east-central Sweden to investigate the influence of different canopy tree species on the bryophyte species richness. Granite boulders lying below crowns of Ulmus glabra (elm), Fraxinus excelsior (ash), Acer platanoides (maple), Quercus robur (oak), Betula pendula (birch), and Picea abies (Norway spruce) were studied in two mixed stands. Both boulder area and within-boulder habitat diversity were positively related to species richness. Boulders below the base-rich deciduous trees F. excelsior, U glabra and A. platanoides held roughly twice as many species as those below P. abies, w.th Q. robur and B. pendula as intermediates. The rank order among trees was as expected from bark pH and litter decomposability in the literature. We also used sample plots to investigate species richness at a smaller scale. Within plots, intermediate levels of litter, inclination and exposed rock promoted species richness, and also the covering tree species had an effect. Individual plots were on average not more species-rich on large boulders than on small ones. This leads us to conclude that population extinctions on the plot-level, and re-colonisations from other parts of the boulder, are less important for species richness than within-boulder habitat diversity. Since species richness was lower under P. abies it is important to favour a diversity of tree species and to include base-rich deciduous trees in otherwise homogeneous Picea forests.

AB  - Although black (Rattus rattus)and brown (Rattus norvegicus) rats are among the most widespread synanthropic wild rodents, there is a surprising scarcity of knowledge about their ecology in the urban ecosystem. In particular, relatively few studies have investigated their helminth species diversity in such habitat. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guideline to synthesize the existing published literature regarding the helminth fauna of urban rats in developed countries (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan). We aimed at describing the species diversity and richness of urban rat helminths, the species prevalence and associations, the methods of investigation, the pathological changes observed in the hosts, the risk factors of infection and the public health significance of rat-borne helminthiases. Twenty-three scientific papers published between 1946 and 2019 were reviewed, half of them were conducted in Europe. Twenty-five helminth species and eight genera were described from the liver, digestive tract, lungs and muscles of urban rats. The most commonly reported parasite wasCalodium hepaticum. Prevalence and risk factors of helminth infection in urban rats varied greatly between studies. Observed pathological findings in the rat host were generally minor, except forC. hepaticum. Several rat helminths can parasitize humans and are therefore of public health significance. The lack of references to identification keys and the rare use of molecular tools for species confirmation represent the main limitation of these studies. Knowledge gap on this topic and the needs for future research are discussed.

AB  - The response of a deep, cold-water benthic community to physical disturbance from offshore drilling was investigated using Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. This study presents a novel method for characterising changes in the ecosystem function of deep-water benthic megafaunal communities in response to physical disturbance. Ecosystem function is investigated using a range of community parameters, particularly abundance and diversity. High levels of physical disturbance, characterised by smothering of the seabed within a radius of 50 to 120 m around the drilling site, resulted in significant but variable reductions in megafaunal abundance (up to 92.3%). Reductions in diversity, particularly in species richness, were apparent between disturbed (Mao Tao estimated species richness of ES(500) = 12.9) and undisturbed areas (ES(500) = 20.6). The implications of selective removal of taxa on ecosystem function and recovery are discussed. Low level disturbance had comparatively little effect on the megafaunal communities; the effects varied in nature depending on motility and functional group (e.g. motile scavenger abundances were maximal at intermediate distances from disturbance). We conclude by comparing the functioning of the ecosystem under different regimes of disturbance and discuss implications for recovery of disturbed deep-sea habitats.

AB  - Climate change is expected to cause an increased frequency of extreme events such as heavy floods and major storms. Such stochastic events have an immediate impact on surface water quality, but the long-term effects are largely unknown. In this study, we assess long-term monitoring data from two Swedish headwater catchments affected by extreme weather events. At one site, where nitrogen effects in soil water, groundwater, and stream water were studied after storm-felling and subsequent forest dieback from bark beetle attack, long-term (>5 years) but relatively modest (generally <1 mg L-1) increases in ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations were observed in the various aqueous media. At the other site, where effects on benthic fauna were studied in a stream impacted by extreme geophysical disturbances caused by rainstorm-induced flashflood, only short-term (1 year) effects were revealed both regarding diversity and composition of species.

AB  - Higher plant species richness has been proposed to increase the resilience of plant communities to disturbance. The purpose of this Study was to test whether this is true for reindeer grazed arctic tundra vegetation. Plant biomass, plant community structure, and species richness were measured along four fences that separated areas grazed by reindeer from ungrazed areas in northern Norway. I found a negative relationship between plant species richness and the change in species richness and biomass Clue to grazing. These results indicate diversity did not confer greater resilience to increased reindeer grazing intensity. No support for higher grazing pressure in diverse habitats were recorded, thus, these results suggest lower resilience to grazing in species-rich arctic tundra vegetation.

AB  - The fragmentation and deterioration of old-growth forest habitat by modern forestry have become a major threat to species diversity in Fennoscandia. In order to develop a conservation strategy for the remaining diversity it is essential to identify the existing diversity and to develop appropriate conservation and monitoring programs. For these purposes indicators of conservation value for administrative prioritization are required. This study examines the predictability of plant and fungal species richness on two spatial scales on 46 isolated old-growth forest islands (0.17-12 ha) in a forest-wetland mosaic. We explore (1) to what extent area, isolation and stand structure variables can explain the variation in species richness and (2) if richness patterns of individual species groups correlate. Isolation showed no relation to species richness. Area explained 50-70% of the variation in total species richness and was positively related to the density of crustose lichens and Red-list species in island interiors. Stand structure variables explained 28-66% of the residual variation in total species richness after controlling for island size, and 15-73% of the variation in density of species in island interiors. The highest predictability of species richness was found among substrate-specific fungi and Red-list species. Different stand structure variables were found to explain richness in the different species groups, and only among a few species groups species richness correlated. Thus, species richness of one single species group is unlikely to be a good indicator for total biodiversity. The results show that measurements of stand size and stand structure variables may be a strong complementary tool. and sometimes a substitute to extensive species inventories when one aims to estimate and monitor plant and fungal species diversity in old-growth Picea abies forests.

AB  - Carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) were collected by using pitfall traps in 68 sites on the Aland Islands, SW Finland.  The sites were divided into four environmental types: 1) cultivated fields and grazed pastures, 2) recently abandoned fields, 3) abandoned, overgrown cultivations, and 4) forests.  A total of 4901 carabids belonging to 77 species were caught. Twenty of the most abundant species were classified into four distributional types according to their occurrence among the various environmental types: 1) generalists (five species), 2) field species (five species), 3) species of open habitat (seven species), and 4) forest species (three species). Associations with environmental types were strictest among field species and forest species. However, most of the species were found in low numbers outside each preferred environmental type.  The number of species and species diversity was highest in fields and pastures and lowest in forests, which agrees with previously detected patterns on the mainland Finland. Pairwise similarity of the carabid assemblages among the environmental types was highest between the two types of abandoned cultivations. The spatial distribution of two carabid species; Pterostichus melanarius and P. niger, were examined in detail to ascertain whether any interspecific interaction could help explain their different island-mainland distribution observed in previous studies.

AB  - Human-caused habitat destruction and modification constitute one of the largest threats to population persistence and biodiversity, and are also suspected to be the major cause behind the global decline of amphibian populations. We assessed the potential role of agriculture-related habitat fragmentation on population size and genetic variability in the common frog (Rana temporaria) by recording the occurrence, population density and genetic diversity in three geographically disparate regions in Sweden - each containing landscapes of high and low agricultural activity - and related these to landscape variables extracted from digital maps. We found a highly significant region-by-landscape interaction in occurrence, population density and genetic diversity revealing a reversed response to agriculture from south to north: while the effects of agriculture on R. temporaria populations were negative in the south, there were no effects in the central region, whereas positive effects were observed in the north. Spatial autocorrelation analyses of genetic data revealed that populations in high agricultural activity areas were more isolated than populations in low activity areas both in the southern and central regions of Sweden. Landscape diversity showed a strong positive correlation with both density and occurrence of frogs in Sweden as a whole, as well as in the southern region. Also, negative effects of roads and positive effects of ditches on genetic diversity were found in the south. Overall, these results suggest clear but regionally opposite effects of habitat structure on the population size and genetic diversity of amphibian populations. This means that the management strategy aiming to maximize the size and genetic diversity of local common frog populations, and perhaps also those of other amphibian populations, should account for regional differences in existing land-use patterns.

AB  - By reference to a series of 15 sampling stations spanning the West Shetland Slope ( 150 - 1000 m; Faroe - Shetland Channel, North-east Atlantic) we examined the potential environmental controls on the standing stock, diversity and composition of the polychaete fauna. In contrast to the majority of studied bathyal environments, the Faroe - Shetland Channel has a highly complex and dynamic hydrographic regime, particularly notable for extreme thermal variability at mid-slope depths (i.e. 7 degrees C range at ca. 500 m). Contrary to general expectation, polychaete biomass increased ( rather than decreased) with depth. Species diversity exhibited a parabolic pattern with depth, maximum diversity occurring at depths of 350 - 550 m, rather shallower than observed in other bathyal studies, and possibly linked with a maximum in habitat temperature range. Multivariate analyses of faunal composition suggested a separation of the sampling stations into a shallower and a deeper group, with temperature exerting a major control on polychaete species distributions. The decline in diversity below 600 m (i.e. the descending limb of the parabolic relationship) may be a result of historically limited immigration/recolonization of the thermally isolated Arctic deep-water basins that feed the cold-water flow through the Faroe - Shetland Channel. The bathymetric distribution of polychaetes and other benthos in this region appears to be intimately linked with the thermal regime, having a long-term impact ( geological timescales) on the deep-water species pool and leading to local enhancement of diversity where cold-and warm-water masses meet and mix.

AB  - Plantations of Norway spruce have been established well beyond its natural range in many parts of the world, potentially impacting native microbial ecosystems and the processes they mediate. In this study, we investigate how the establishment of spruce plantations in a landscape dominated by native birch forests in western Norway impacts soil properties and belowground fungal communities. Soil cores were collected from neighboring stands of planted spruce and native birch forests. We used DNA metabarcoding of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 region and ergosterol measurements to survey the fungal community composition and its biomass, respectively. In the two investigated soil layers (litter and humus), fungal community composition, diversity and biomass were strongly affected by the tree species shift. Native birch stands hosted markedly richer fungal communities, including numerous fungi not present in planted spruce stands. In contrast, the spruce stands included higher relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi as well as higher fungal biomass. Hence, establishing plantations of Norway spruce in native birch forests leads to significant losses in diversity, but increase in biomass of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which could potentially impact carbon sequestration processes and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Plant species beta diversity is influenced by spatial heterogeneity in the environment. This heterogeneity can potentially be characterised with the help of remote sensing. We used WorldView-2 satellite data acquired over semi-natural grasslands on The Baltic island of Oland (Sweden) to examine whether dissimilarities in remote sensing response were related to fine-scale, between-plot dissimilarity (beta diversity) in non-woody vascular plant species composition within the grasslands. Fieldwork, including the on-site description of a set of 30 2 m x 2 m plots and a set of 30 4 m x 4 m plots, was performed to record the species dissimilarity between pairs of same-sized plots. Spectral data were extracted by associating each plot with a suite of differently sized pixel windows, and spectral dissimilarity was calculated between pairs of same-sized pixel windows. Relationships between spectral dissimilarity and beta diversity were analysed using univariate regression and partial least squares regression. The study revealed significant positive relationships between spectral dissimilarity and fine-scale (2 m x 2 m and 4 m x 4 m) between-plot species dissimilarity. The correlation between the predicted and the observed species dissimilarity was stronger for the set of large plots (4 m x 4 m) than for the set of small plots (2 m x 2 m), and the association between spectral and species data at both plot scales decreased when pixel windows larger than 3 x 3 pixels were used. We suggest that the significant relationship between spectral dissimilarity and species dissimilarity is a reflection of between-plot environmental heterogeneity caused by differences in grazing intensity (which result in between-plot differences in field-layer height, and amounts of biomass and litter). This heterogeneity is reflected in dissimilarities in both the species composition and the spectral response of the grassland plots. Between-plot dissimilarities in both spectral response and species composition may also be caused by between-plot variations in edaphic conditions. Our results indicate that high spatial resolution satellite data may potentially be able to complement field-based recording in surveys of fine-scale species diversity in semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Modern silviculture has led to a reduction in deadwood, especially that of large diameter, and thus the loss of an important habitat niche in most European forests. We analyzed the significance of deadwood for the total species diversity in three plant groups (bryophytes, lichens, and vascular plants) in one of Central Europe's few remnants of unmanaged old-growth forest. The site is a montane forest of Picea abies on Mt. Brocken, Harz Mountains, Germany, which has not been managed for at least several centuries, undergoes natural forest dynamics, and thus harbors large amounts of standing and downed deadwood. Epiphyte vegetation of live trees and the ground vegetation were studied for comparison. We did not find any obligate deadwood species. Nevertheless, 84 % (70 species) of the total species were found on standing or downed deadwood. One-third of these species, or 28 % of the total species in the forest, were only sampled on deadwood, whereas the remaining species were also found on live trees and/or the ground. Bryophytes were the largest group of species on deadwood (47 % of the deadwood-inhabiting species), followed by lichens (37 %) and vascular plants (16 %). Large-diameter deadwood in an advanced stage of decay harbored more species than smaller fragments in the early stages of decay. Despite the lack of obligate deadwood colonizers, deadwood apparently plays a key role for forest plant diversity, mainly by providing an environment with low competition and thus facilitating the establishment of species.

AB  - Assessing the relative contribution of local diversity to regional biodiversity may be the key to understanding large-scale and even global patterns in species diversity. Here, the contribution of habitat heterogeneity of cold seeps at three spatial scales [micro-scale (ms), macro-scale (10 to 100s of ms), and mega-scale (10 to 100s of km)] to the total nematode biodiversity (genus level) along the Norwegian continental margin is evaluated. Due to the development of higher resolution bathymetry and increased bottom sampling in recent years, continental margins, once regarded as monotonous landscapes, are now acknowledged to have a high degree of habitat complexity and diversity. By calculating the additive partitioning of gamma diversity in alpha and beta fractions, we examined to what extent habitat diversity of seep sites significantly increases the nematode genus composition and diversity at different spatial scales. Siboglinidae patches and control sediments yielded comparably high levels of nematode genus richness. They exhibited low turnover rates within and across the different seep sites. In contrast, the bacterial mats at Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) and the reduced sediments at the Nyegga pockmarks harboured genus-poor nematode communities with an equally high dominance of one or two species, which were different for each seep. Different habitats, in particular at the HMMV, contributed significantly to the seep nematode richness. This study demonstrates that the presence of distinct habitat types within multiple seep sites contributes to the high diversity of nematode communities inhabiting the seeps in the Norwegian deep sea.

AB  - Soil data of 18 pairs of secondary pure spruce stands (Picea abies) and adjacent mixed stands of spruce and broadleaf trees (at least 40% broadleaf trees, mainly beech, Fagus sylvatica) on comparable sites were used to study effects of species composition and other driving forces on carbon and nitrogen stores. It was hypothesized that carbon input by litter and roots to different soil horizons has a marked effect on carbon and nitrogen stores and, therefore. silvicultural methods, e.g., admixture of beech versus spruce, can be used to manage nitrogen retention and release. The study sites of different stand age (pole to mature stage) were chosen on two different bedrock materials (Flysch and Molasse). In general, soils on Flysch are less acidic, better supplied with nutrients, and less sandy than soils developed on Molasse. Species composition did not affect total stores (forest floor and 0-50 cm mineral soil) of carbon or nitrogen on Molasse, however, paired samples tests indicated that mean total stores were significantly higher both for carbon and nitrogen for pure spruce stands than for mixed species stands on Flysch. Carbon stores of the whole soil profile were best predicted by admixture of spruce, stores of phosphorus, sodium and calcium as well as stand age on Flysch; on Molasse, the only given predictor was aluminum storage, indicating that acidic soil conditions favor accumulation of organic carbon. On Flysch, total nitrogen stores were best explained by stores of sulfur and of the sum of base cations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In November 2004 a large windstorm affected forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies(L.) H. Karst, 1881) in the High Tatras National Park, Slovakia, and was followed by a wildfire (2005) and bark beetle outbreak. In this study we investigate temporal changes of breeding bird community (their species richness, density and diversity) as well as different nest-position guilds, in relation to disturbance type. Bird species composition was surveyed in two periods (2006 and 2007, and 2017 and 2018) using the point count method on four plots differing by disturbance type - undisturbed forest, unlogged windthrow, salvage logged windthrow and burnt salvage logged windthrow. A total of three visits per point and breeding season were performed at forty point count sites. We also assessed the successional shift in habitat characteristics between the two monitored periods. In total, 55 bird species and 2059 individuals were recorded on the plots during the study. We observed no effect of disturbance type on mean species richness, abundance and Simpson's diversity per point; however, those characteristics did significantly increase over the study duration. While differently disturbed points had previously differed in their (nest-position) guild number and diversity, the differences between them disappeared over time. We found different trajectories of temporal change in the composition of the species communities and guild diversity in relation to disturbance type, but in a similar direction. During the first period, the greater the initial differences in the severity of disturbance among the disturbance types, the greater the differences were in the composition of bird communities; however, the differences gradually diminished as the forests regenerated. Alterations in habitat structure caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbance and by subsequent succession were the most probable reasons for the altered bird communities and observed patterns of recovery.

AB  - Digital technologies, including participatory Internet mapping, social media and smartphones, provide new avenues for research in outdoor recreation and tourism. The potential to reach a greater audience and collect visitation data on a broader scale, with less costs than traditional paper surveys, are key advantages that have increased the use of these novel technologies. Using of mobile apps for data collection is still at the experimental stage. We evaluate previous attempts to use apps for monitoring recreation and tourism in protected areas, as an alternative to other in situ or online methods. We present a pilot study implemented in Jotunheimen National Park (Norway), where we developed a mobile app for visitor monitoring and real-time mapping of values and experiences. We present the lessons learned, give suggestions on how and for what apps can be used, and discuss the advantages and limitations of using smartphones for visitor monitoring in protected areas.

AB  - Changes in carbon stocks during deforestation, reforestation and afforestation play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Cultivation of forest lands leads to substantial losses in both biomass and soil carbon, whereas forest regrowth is considered to be a significant carbon sink. We examined below- and aboveground carbon stocks along a chronosequence of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands (0-62 years old) regenerating on abandoned meadows in the Southern Alps. A 130-year-old mixed coniferous Norway spruce-white fir (Abies alba Mill.) forest, managed by selection cutting, was used as an undisturbed control. Deforestation about 260 years ago led to carbon losses of 53 Mg C ha(-1) from the organic layer and 12 Mg C ha(-1) from the upper mineral horizons (A(h) E). During the next 200 years of grassland use, the new Ah horizon sequestered 29 Mg C ha(-1). After the abandonment of these meadows, carbon stocks in tree stems increased exponentially during natural forest succession, levelling off at about 190 Mg C ha(-1) in the 62-year-old Norway spruce and the 130-year-old Norway spruce-white fir stands. In contrast, carbon stocks in the organic soil layer increased linearly with stand age. During the first 62 years, carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.36 Mg C ha(-1) L year(-1) in the organic soil layer. No clear trend with stand age was observed for the carbon stocks in the Ah horizon. Soil respiration rates were similar for all forest stands independently of organic layer thickness or carbon stocks, but the highest rates were observed in the cultivated meadow. Thus, increasing litter inputs by forest vegetation compared with the meadow, and constantly low decomposition rates of coniferous litter were probably responsible for continuous soil carbon sequestration during forest succession. Carbon accumulation in woody biomass seemed to slow down after 60 to 80 years, but continued in the organic soil layer. We conclude that, under present climatic conditions, forest soils act as more persistent carbon sinks than vegetation that will be harvested, releasing the carbon sequestered during tree growth.

AB  - Tree species diversity can positively affect the multifunctionality of forests. This is why conifer monocultures of Scots pine and Norway spruce, widely promoted in Central Europe since the 18th and 19th century, are currently converted into mixed stands with naturally dominant European beech. Biodiversity is expected to benefit from these mixtures compared to pure conifer stands due to increased abiotic and biotic resource heterogeneity. Evidence for this assumption is, however, largely lacking. Here, we investigated the diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens at the plot (alpha diversity) and at the landscape (gamma diversity) level in pure and mixed stands of European beech and conifer species (Scots pine, Norway spruce, Douglas fir) in four regions in Germany. We aimed to identify compositions of pure and mixed stands in a hypothetical forest landscape that can optimize gamma diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens within regions. Results show that gamma diversity of the investigated groups is highest when a landscape comprises different pure stands rather than tree species mixtures at the stand scale. Species mainly associated with conifers rely on light regimes that are only provided in pure conifer forests, whereas mixtures of beech and conifers are more similar to beech stands. Combining pure beech and pure conifer stands at the landscape scale can increase landscape level biodiversity and conserve species assemblages of both stand types, while landscapes solely composed of stand scale tree species mixtures could lead to a biodiversity reduction of a combination of investigated groups of 7 up to 20%.

AB  - Extensive changes in land cover during the 20th century are known to have had detrimental effects on biodiversity in rural landscapes, but the magnitude of change and their ecological effects are not well known on regional scales. We digitized historical maps from the beginning of the 20th century over a 1652 km(2) study area in southeastern Sweden, comparing it to modern-day land cover with a focus on valuable habitat types. Semi-natural grassland cover decreased by over 96 % in the study area, being largely lost to afforestation and silviculture. Grasslands on finer soils were more likely to be converted into modern grassland or arable fields. However, in addition to remaining semi-natural grassland, today's valuable deciduous forest and wetland habitats were mostly grazed grassland in 1900. An analysis of the landscape-level biodiversity revealed that plant species richness was generally more related to the modern landscape, with grazing management being a positive influence on species richness.

AB  - The vulnerability of forest ecosystem services to climate change is expected to depend on landscape characteristic and management history, but may also be influenced by the proximity to the southern range limit of constituent tree species. In the Western Rhodopes in South Bulgaria, Norway spruce is an important commercial species, but is approaching its current southern limit. Using climate sensitive forest models, we projected the impact of climate change on timber production, carbon storage, biodiversity and soil retention in two representative landscapes in the Western Rhodopes; a lower elevation landscape (1000-1450 m a.s.l) dominated by mixed species forests, and a higher elevation landscape (1550-2100 m a.s.l.) currently dominated by spruce. In both landscapes climate change is projected to induce a shift in forest composition, with drought-sensitive species, such as Norway spruce, being replaced by more drought-tolerant species such as Scots pine and black pine at lower elevations. In the higher elevation landscape a reduction in spruce growth is projected, particularly under the more severe climate change scenarios. Under most climate scenarios a reduction in growing stock is projected to occur, but under some scenarios a moderate increase in higher elevation stands (> 1500 m a.s.l.) is expected. Climate change is projected to negatively influence carbon storage potential across landscapes with the magnitude depending on the severity of the climate change scenario. The impact of climate change on forest diversity and habitat availability is projected to differ considerably between the two landscapes, with diversity and habitat quality generally increasing at higher elevations, and being reduced at lower elevations. Our results suggest that if currently management practices are maintained the sensitivity of forests and forest ecosystem services in the Western Rhodopes to climate change will differ between low and higher elevation sites and will depend strongly on current forest composition.

AB  - Using an economic valuation approach, we assessed people's stated preferences for policy aimed at enhancing restoration of functional networks of naturally dynamic boreal forest habitats as a public good. Active landscape restoration can improve the functionality of boreal forest habitats as green infrastructure, which is essential for biodiversity conservation and delivery of multiple ecosystem services that production forests are poor at providing. In contrast, so far designation of protected areas in Fennoscandia has focused on remnant patches of near-natural forests, and not on forest landscape restoration. We assessed citizens' preferences for forest landscape restoration in a transboundary region primarily managed for sustained-yield wood production for the forest industry, and which hosts the transboundary Fulufjallet National Parks in Sweden and Norway. We conducted a discrete choice experiment by asking Swedish and Norwegian citizens to choose among two options for the Fulufjallet area, including (1) extension of passive protection on one side or both sides of the border, by additional area protection and restoration of forest naturalness, and (2) a status quo option. The scenario assumed that extension of the protected forest area would imply a compulsory tax administered bilaterally by the two countries. Just over half of the sample, in both countries expressed willingness to pay for forest landscape restoration. Alternatives that contemplated larger extensions of forest landscape restoration were assigned higher willingness-to-pay. Public awareness and support, combined with spatial planning, are necessary for forest landscape restoration to become a viable tool for biodiversity conservation in Scandinavia.

AB  - Differences in spatial rooting patterns among coexisting species have been recognized as an important mechanism for generating biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. However, it is not yet clear whether complementarity in root space exploration is a universal characteristic of multi-species woody communities. In a temperate broad-leaved forest with a mosaic of species-poor and species-rich stands, we tested two hypotheses related to putative below-ground 'overyielding' in more diverse forests, (1) that species mixture results in a partial spatial segregation of the fine root systems of different species, and (2) that stand fine root biomass increases with tree species diversity. We investigated 12 stands either with one, three, or five dominant tree species (4 replicate stands each) under similar soil and climate conditions for stand fine root biomass and spatial root segregation in vertical and horizontal direction in the soil. Fine roots of different tree species were identified using a morphological key based on differences in colour, periderm surface structure, and branching patterns. In species-poor and species-rich stands, and in all tree species present, fine root density (biomass per soil volume) decreased exponentially with soil depth at very similar rates. Stand fine root biomass in the densely rooted upper soil (0-40 cm depth) was not significantly different between stands with 1, 3 or 5 dominant tree species. We conclude that 'below-ground overyielding' in terms of higher fine root biomasses in species-rich stands as compared to monospecific ones does not occur in these broad-leaved forests which most likely results from a missing complementarity in vertical rooting patterns of the present tree species.

AB  - The generation of ecosystem services depends on both social and ecological features. Here we focus on management, its ecological consequences, and social drivers. Our approach combined (1) quantitative surveys of local species diversity and abundance of three functional groups of ecosystem service providers (pollinators, seed dispersers, and insectivores) with (2) qualitative studies of local management practices connected to these services and their underlying social mechanisms, i.e., institutions, local ecological knowledge, and a sense of place. It focused on the ecology of three types of green areas (allotment gardens, cemeteries, and city parks) in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. These are superficially similar but differ considerably in their management. Effects of the different practices could be seen in the three functional groups, primarily as a higher abundance of pollinators in the informally managed allotment gardens and as differences in the composition of seed dispersers and insectivores. Thus, informal management, which is normally disregarded by planning authorities, is important for ecosystem services in the urban landscape. Furthermore, we suggest that informal management has an important secondary function: It may be crucial during periods of instability and change as it is argued to promote qualities with potential for adaptation. Allotment gardeners seem to be the most motivated managers, something that is reflected in their deeper knowledge and can be explained by a sense of place and management institutions. We propose that co-management would be one possible way to infuse the same positive qualities into all management and that improved information exchange between managers would be one further step toward ecologically functional urban landscapes.

AB  - We compared diversity of birds in 35 study plots of equal size (58 ha) and productivity in western Norway, ranging from pure native pine Pinus sylvestris forests (n = 7), through different mosaics of native pine forests and spruce Picea spp. plantations (n = 21), to pure spruce plantations (n = 7). Diversity was evaluated by means of species richness, diversity indices, relative abundance curves and rarefaction. The diversity indices appeared to be less suitable for our purpose. Species richness was higher in pine forest than in spruce forest. However, a peak in species richness was found in mosaic forest. For pooled samples (408 ha), 11 bird species recorded in pine forest were not found in spruce forest, seven species were found in spruce forest but nor in pine forest, and seven species were confined to the medium mosaics of pine and spruce forest (on average 56% pine and 44% spruce). We argue that, when mixing two habitat types A and B, the ratio of these habitats that maximize avian diversity depends on the ratio of species confined to habitat A and B, as well as the number of species favoured by the mixture of A and B. Existing spruce plantations (13% of the area) in native pine forests of western Norway have reduced the diversity of birds locally, but increased the diversity of birds on the landscape and regional scale.

AB  - Veteran hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are keystone structures hosting high insect diversity but are declining in numbers due to intensification of land use and the abandonment of traditional management. The loss of this vital habitat is resulting in a reduction of biodiversity, and this likely has consequences for ecosystem functioning, especially if functional diversity is reduced. A considerable amount of research has been done on predictors of beetle taxonomic diversity in veteran oaks, but predictors of functional diversity have remained largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to establish whether the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are related to functional diversity within three functional groups of beetles (decomposers, predators, and flower visitors) and determine whether species richness and functional diversity within the groups are dependent on the same predictors. Sampling was carried out intermittently between 2004 and 2011 on 61 veteran oaks in Southern Norway. Of the 876 beetle species that were collected, 359 were determined to be decomposers, 284 were predators, and 85 were flower visitors. Species richness and functional diversity in all groups were consistently higher in traps mounted on veteran oaks in forests than in open landscapes. However, additional predictors differed between groups, and for species richness and functional diversity. Decomposer species richness responded to tree vitality, while functional diversity responded to habitat connectivity, predator species richness responded to regrowth of shrubs while functional diversity responded to tree circumference, and flower visitor richness and functional diversity did not respond to any additional predictors. Previous studies have found that the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are important for conservation of taxonomic diversity, and the results from this study indicate that they are also important for functional diversity within multiple functional groups.

AB  - Converting monocultures to mixed-species stands is thought to be a promising approach to increase forest productivity and resilience, while additionally providing other ecosystem goods and services (EGS). However, the importance of tree species composition and structure remains unclear, particularly beyond the stand scale due to the difficulty of conducting comprehensive, long-term experiments.
   To compare the ability of different tree species mixtures to provide various EGS at the landscape scale.
   We used a dynamic forest landscape model to simulate all possible combinations of dominant tree species for two landscapes; a high-elevation alpine region (Dischma valley, Switzerland) and a lowland valley (Mt. Feldberg, Germany). We evaluated multiple EGS, including protection from gravitational hazards, aboveground biomass, and habitat quality, and examined trade-offs and synergies between them.
   Mixed-species forests were usually better in providing multiple EGS, although monocultures were often best for single EGS. The simulation results also demonstrated how changing environmental conditions along an elevational gradient had a strong impact on the structure of different species combinations and therefore on the provisioning of EGS.
   Tree species diversity alone is not a good predictor of multifunctionality. Mixtures should be selected based on local environmental conditions, complementary functional traits, and the ability to provide the EGS of interest. Although our work focused on current climatic conditions, we discuss how the modelling framework could be employed to consider the impacts of climate change and disturbances to improve our understanding of how mixed-species stands could be used to cope with these challenges.

AB  - Forest continuity has been identified as an important factor influencing the structure and diversity of forest vegetation. Primary forests with centuries of continuity are usually more diverse than young secondary forests as forest are colonized only slowly and because the former are richer in old tree individuals. In the present study, performed in unmanaged high-elevation spruce forests of the Harz Mountains, Germany, we had the unique opportunity to separate the effects of forest continuity and tree age on plant diversity. We compared an old-growth spruce forest with century-long habitat continuity with an adjacent secondary spruce forest, which had naturally established on a former bog after 1796 when peat exploitation halted. Comparative analysis of the ground and epiphyte vegetation showed that the plant diversity of the old-growth forest was not higher than that of the secondary forest with a similar tree age of >200 years. Our results suggest that a period of >200 years was sufficient for the secondary forest to be colonized by the whole regional species pool of herbaceous and cryptogam forest plants and epiphytes. Therefore, it is likely that habitat structure, including the presence of old and decaying trees, was more important for determining plant diversity than the independent effect of forest continuity. Our results are probably not transferrable to spruce forests younger than 200 years and highly fragmented woodlands with long distances between new stands and old-growth forests that serve as diaspore sources. In addition, our results might be not transferable to remote areas without notable air pollution, as the epiphyte vegetation of the study area was influenced by SO2 pollution in the second half of the 20th century.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is often assumed to benefit farmland biodiversity. Increasing heterogeneity of non-crop habitats is often too costly in terms of agricultural production. It has been suggested that increased crop heterogeneity could mitigate the negative effects of intensification on biodiversity while still maintaining high production levels.
   We investigated if habitat-specific species pools of two groups of farmland birds, field-nesting and non-crop-nesting species, were related to landscape-level heterogeneity of crop and non-crop cover. We analysed total number of species (gamma diversity) and average local species richness (alpha diversity) in landscapes and related these two biodiversity measures to four components of landscape heterogeneity (compositional and configurational heterogeneity of crop and non-crop cover).
   We selected 30 farmland landscapes (each 25 km(2)) in Sweden that largely broke up correlated relationships between crop and non-crop heterogeneity and between compositional and configurational heterogeneity. Estimates of species richness (alpha and gamma diversity) were calculated with bird survey data from specific habitats within landscapes (farmsteads and arable fields) and then related to measures of landscape heterogeneity.
   No measure of landscape species richness was associated with landscape-scale crop cover heterogeneities. However, gamma diversity of both bird groups was negatively related to the compositional and configurational heterogeneity of non-crop land-use in the landscapes, respectively.
   Our results suggest that: (i) crop heterogeneities are not related to habitat-specific richness of farmland birds, (ii) heterogeneity effects of habitat complementarity in general are weak and (iii) relationships between diversity and heterogeneity in landscapes are dependent on the biodiversity measure used.

AB  - Stand structure, mean tree age, deadwood amount and microclimate all change markedly in the course of natural forest dynamics. The last remaining primeval forests of the temperate forest biome are valuable study objects to investigate the effects of forest dynamics and management on forest structure and function as well as phytodiversity, which is not sufficiently understood.
   Three pairs of Fagus sylvatica primeval and production forests in eastern Slovakia were selected for studying the effects of natural forest development stages on vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen species richness and composition. We further compared the diversity patterns in the initial, optimal and terminal stages of forest development with those of nearby production forests.
   The plot-level species richness of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens increased from the initial to the terminal stage, but only lichens exhibited a significantly higher cumulative species richness ( diversity) in the later (optimal and terminal) stages. No increase in species richness from the initial to the terminal stage was found for deadwood-inhabiting epiphytes and the ground-layer vascular plants. Canonical correspondence analyses identified characteristic bryophyte and lichen species for the different development stages, while the bulk of vascular ground layer species occurred across all stages with no stage preference.
   Stem diameter was an even more important driver of epiphyte diversity and species composition than the development stage. All stages of the primeval forests (including the initial) were more species-rich in epiphytes and, when investigating larger plot numbers, also in vascular plants than the production forests.
   Synthesis. In primeval forests of European beech, plant species richness did not differ significantly between the consecutive forest development stages, while species composition did. This is attributable to the small-scale mosaic structure of the forest, rapid gap closure by beech, and the continuity of deadwood across the stages, which reduces spatio-temporal differences in microhabitat availability in the forest. Bryophytes and lichens are species-richer, and vascular plants at least similarly rich, in the primeval as compared to the production forests, if the study area is sufficiently large.

AB  - The loss of large natural areas due to development has increased interest for and use of vegetated areas in urban and suburban areas for wildlife habitats. The goal of this study was to quantify vegetation characteristics for each type of land cover found in the greater Tucson, Arizona area, thereby providing a predictive tool for wildlife management and other land management issues. This research was based on and is a continuation of a pilot study that developed a method associating land cover categories to aerial photographs in eastern Pima County, including the City of Tucson. Aggregation of land cover categories used by Tucson and Pima County and verifications of any uncertain classifications of land cover with field evaluations produced a consistent land cover classification system and database. Natural open space was the largest land cover category within our study area, comprising 52% of the total land cover. Riparian areas, low-density housing and natural open space areas had the highest percentage of native vegetation and escape cover. Golf and neighborhood parks ranked much lower than these land covers relative to native vegetation and escape cover (vegetation with foliage/stems at ground level). The most structurally diverse plant communities were associated with medium density residential areas and zoos that contain a relatively high number of exotic species. Results from the wildlife habitats index indicated riparian areas as the most valuable habitats in eastern Pima County (the county where Tucson is located), followed by low-density housing (less than or equal to1 residence/acre), natural open space, and federal/state parks and forests.

AB  - An enigma of deep-sea biodiversity research is that the abyss with its low productivity and densities appears to have a biodiversity similar to that of shallower depths. This conceptualization of similarity is based mainly on per-sample estimates (point diversity, within-habitat, or alpha-diversity). Here, we use a measure of between-sample within-community diversity (beta(1H),) to examine benthic foraminiferal diversity between 333 stations within 49 communties from New Zealand, the South Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the Norwegian Sea, and the Arctic. The communities are grouped into two depth categories: 200-1500 m and >1500 m. beta(1H) diversity exhibits no evidence of regional differences. Instead, higher values at shallower depths are observed worldwide. At depths of >1500 m the average beta(1H) is zero, indicating stasis or no biodiversity gradient. The difference in beta(1H)-diversity explains why, despite species richness often being greater per sample at deeper depths, the total number of species is greater at shallower depths. The greater number of communities and higher rate of evolution resulting in shorter species durations at shallower depths is also consistent with higher beta(1H) values.

AB  - The life strategy of Norway spruce allows the recovery of European spruce forests in a scenario of catastrophic disturbances caused by the European spruce bark beetle. However, little is known about how the development of this insect infestation has influenced the preservation of the ecological balance in these forests over the last decades. Based on the upper montane spruce forests in the Polish Western Carpathians, we decided to check what species of lichens are using the decaying wood of post-bark beetle snags and how the progressive changes in wood hardness and stand decomposition affect the process of species exchange. In 2018-2019, we investigated spruce snags on permanent monitoring plots in Gorce National Park, whose cause and time of death have been recorded since 1999, and earlier in 1992 and 1997. The study covered 374 post-bark beetle spruce snags at 76 sites. We found 84 species, including 77 lichens, 6 lichenicolous fungi and one non-lichenised fungus, 15 of which were exclusively wood-inhabiting species in Gorce range. Using generalised linear models, the wood age (A) and the scale of the forest stand breakdown phenomenon (B) were compared with the altitude (C), the aspects of hillside exposure (D) and the forest plant community (E) in the assessment of their effect on lichen species diversity and abundance. "A" was the most important of the tested factors, significantly and positively influencing both parameters, while "B-D" only weakly influenced lichen abundance. Five groups of wood age, significantly different in the lichen abundance and the composition of species were distinguished, and a characteristic combination of dominant species was determined for each of them. Based on the measurements of the wood hardness under the thalli using Shore's method, the succession of species during the colonisation of the post-bark beetle snags was determined and four groups of species were selected, most frequent in the successive stages of wood decay process. The wood of spruces killed by the bark beetle is both an important substrate enabling the survival of obligately wood-inhabiting lichen species, as well as providing a habitat supporting the maintenance of epiphytes in the Carpathian forests. This study extends the knowledge about the specific requirements of lichens inhabiting spruce snags, as well as the pace and course of lichen succession on this substrate.

AB  - New vegetation in barren areas offers possibilities for sequestering carbon in the soil. Arid and semi-arid areas (ASAs) are candidates for new vegetation. The possibility of agriculture in ASAs is reviewed, revealing the potential for cultivation by covering the surface with a layer of organic fibres. This layer collects more water from humidity in the air than does the uncovered mineral surface, and creates a humid environment that promotes microbial life. One possibility is to use large amounts of organic fibres for soil enhancement in ASAs. In the context of the European Commission Waste Framework Directive, the possibility of using textile waste from Sweden is explored. The costs for using Swedish textile waste are high, but possible gains are the sale of agricultural products and increased land prices as well as environmental mitigation. The findings suggest that field research on such agriculture in ASAs should start as soon as possible.

AB  - The importance of dead wood (coarse woody debris, CWD) for biodiversity in boreal forests is high that is mainly due to its role in nutrient cycling and species habitation. Recognition of its importance in storing carbon has also raised an interest in developing new methods for assessing the quantity and quality of CWD. Since the traditional measuring techniques are often expensive to apply for the estimation of volume characteristics in the field, more attention is currently being paid to remote-sensing techniques that could provide lower cost data for forest inventories over large areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data for estimating downed and standing dead wood volumes. The analysis was based on field measurements from 33 sample plots which were evaluated against the ALS-derived height-intensity metrics obtained from the Koli National Park in eastern Finland. The accuracy of the ALS data proved adequate for predicting the downed dead wood volume (RMSE 51.6%), whereas the standing dead wood volume estimates were somewhat poorer (RMSE 78.8%). The ALS-based volume estimates for downed dead wood were found to be substantially more accurate than the estimates based on field-measured characteristics of living trees. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations are of interest as producers of biomass for fuel, but also as carbon (C) sinks to mitigate CO2 emissions. Carbon sequestration in biomass and soil was estimated in 5-year-old replicated SRC plantations with willows (Salix spp.) on former arable land at five sites in Sweden. Total standing C stocks, i.e. C stored in woody biomass above- and belowground, fine root standing crop, litter, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were estimated by repeated field sampling and C budget calculation.
   Overall, the SRC willow plantations represented a C sink after five years. Estimated increase of total standing C stock was 15% on average compared to pre-planting conditions. There was no change in SOC when including all sites. Analyses within sites revealed a decrease in SOC at one site, although the decrease was compensated for by C stored in willow biomass. After removal of stem biomass, C in other plant pools was sufficient to compensate for the SOC decrease. Remaining C in stumps, stool, and coarse roots was estimated at ca 20% of stem C.
   There was a discrepancy between SOC sequestration rates from soil sampling and C budget calculation, -2.1-1.0 and 0.15-0.45 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Mineralization of old organic material from previous land-use and input to SOC from understory vegetation were not included in the calculations, which may explain part of the differences. The importance of understory litter in C budgets for young plantations was apparent, as it comprised 24-80% of aboveground litter C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Characterization of microbial assemblages via environmental DNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used in routine monitoring programs due to its sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. Several programs have recently been developed which infer functional profiles from 16S rRNA gene data using hidden-state prediction (HSP) algorithms. These might offer an economic and scalable alternative to shotgun metagenomics. To date, HSP-based methods have seen limited use for benthic marine surveys and their performance in these environments remains unevaluated. In this study, 16S rRNA metabarcoding was applied to sediment samples collected at 0 and >= 1,200 m from Norwegian salmon farms, and three metabolic inference approaches (Paprica, Picrust2 and Tax4Fun2) evaluated against metagenomics and environmental data. While metabarcoding and metagenomics recovered a comparable functional diversity, the taxonomic composition differed between approaches, with genera richness up to 20x higher for metabarcoding. Comparisons between the sensitivity (highest true positive rates) and specificity (lowest true negative rates) of HSP-based programs in detecting functions found in metagenomic data ranged from 0.52 and 0.60 to 0.76 and 0.79, respectively. However, little correlation was observed between the relative abundance of their specific functions. Functional beta-diversity of HSP-based data was strongly associated with that of metagenomics (r >= 0.86 for Paprica and Tax4Fun2) and responded similarly to the impact of fish farm activities. Our results demonstrate that although HSP-based metabarcoding approaches provide a slightly different functional profile than metagenomics, partly due to recovering a distinct community, they represent a cost-effective and valuable tool for characterizing and assessing the effects of fish farming on benthic ecosystems.

AB  - Commercial forestry increasingly aims at both optimizing timber production and maintaining species diversity. To maintain the diversity of the species-rich group of wood-inhabiting fungi, effective forest conservation concepts that include the enrichment of dead wood in commercial forests are required. However, which type of dead wood should be enriched in which type of forest stand (coniferous or broad-leaved) is still debated. Our study aimed at (1) disentangling the relative importance of forest stand type, dead-wood origin (tree species) and time since death and (2) determining whether fungal species richness on logs of broad-leaved trees is higher in broad-leaved stands than in coniferous stands and whether fungal species richness on logs of coniferous trees is higher in coniferous stands than in broad-leaved stands (home-field advantage). We exposed logs of 9 broad-leaved and 4 coniferous tree species in 19 broad-leaved and 9 coniferous forest stands in 2009 and surveyed the logs in 2012 and 2014 for wood-inhabiting fungi. Across all logs, fungal species richness was mainly driven by the tree species of the dead wood and time since death, whereas fungal community composition was solely driven by the tree species of the dead wood. The fungal species richness and community composition of broad-leaved logs was significantly correlated to time since death but not to forest stand type. The fungal species richness and community composition of coniferous logs was neither affected by forest-stand type nor time since death. When individual tree species were considered, forest-stand type did not affect fungal species richness or community compositions, but fungal species richness on logs of Acer, Fagus, Carpinus and Populus increased with time since death. To increase the species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi in commercial forests, we recommend that the tree species diversity of dead wood should be increased and should especially originate from different lineages (angiosperms and gymnosperms), and that a broad variety of successional stages of dead wood should be maintained. Our results suggest that such a strategy would be effective irrespective of the tree species composition of the forest stand, as we found no support for home-field advantages in the early stage of decomposition.

AB  - Drought-sensitive European beech forests are increasingly challenged by climate change. Admixing other, preferably more deep-rooting, tree species has been proposed to increase the resilience of beech forests to drought. This diversification of beech forests might also affect soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks that are relevant for a wide range of soil functions and ecosystem services, such as water and nutrient retention, filter functions and erosion control. Since information of these effects is scattered, our aim was to synthesize results from studies that compared SOC/TN stocks of beech monocultures with those of beech stands mixed with other tree species as well as monocultures of other tree species. We conducted a meta-analysis including 38 studies with 203, 220, and 160 observations for forest floor (i.e., the organic surface layer), mineral soil (0.5 m depth) and the total soil profile, respectively. Monoculture conifer stands had higher SOC stocks compared to monoculture beech in general, especially in the forest floor (up to 200% in larch forests). In contrast, other broadleaved tree species (oak, ash, lime, maple, hornbeam) showed lower SOC stocks in the forest floor compared to beech, with little impact on total SOC stocks. Comparing mixed beech-conifer stands (average mixing ratio with regard to number of trees 50:50) with beech monocultures revealed significantly higher total SOC stocks of around 9% and a smaller increase in TN stocks of around 4%. This equaled a SOC accrual of 0.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). In contrast, mixed beech-broadleaved stands did not show significant differences in total SOC stocks. Conifer admixture effects on beech forest SOC were of additive nature. Admixing other tree species to beech monoculture stands was most effective to increase SOC stocks on low carbon soils with a sandy texture and nitrogen limitation (i.e., a high C/N ratio and low nitrogen deposition). We conclude that, with targeted admixture measures of coniferous species, an increase in SOC stocks in beech forests can be achieved as part of the necessary adaptation of beech forests to climate change.

AB  - We investigated the effects of thinning intensity on the carbon allocation of Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. Hook by analyzing the stand growth and carbon content of a plantation under three thinning intensities (I: 70%; II: 50%; III: 30%) and with no thinning treatment. Using the carbon balance framework of the CROwn BASe (CROBAS) model and multi-source inventory data, we calibrated the parameters of the CROBAS-C. lanceolata (CROBAS-CL) model to simulate the carbon content in the plantation. We validated the CROBAS-CL model by comparing the predicted stand diameter at breast height (DBH) and stand height (H) with the measured values. Finally, the predicted stand carbon was compared with the soil carbon to assess the dynamics and allocation of ecosystem carbon content. Overall, our findings suggest that the predicted stand carbon of CROBAS-CL satisfies the statistical test requirements: the deviation of height and DBH predicted by the CROBAS-CL model from the measured height and DBH are less than 0.087 m and 0.165 cm, respectively. These results confirm that the model is useful for a dynamic prediction of stand carbon in C. lanceolata plantations. Based on the results of the proposed model, we determine that Thinning III (30% thinning intensity) is beneficial for the growth of C. lanceolata plantations and improving soil carbon sequestration. Additionally, the simulated carbon storage of an individual tree in the C. lanceolata plantation gradually increased with the tree age. Our study provides a strong reference for the efficient operation and management of C. lanceolata plantations in southwestern China.

AB  - Too many salmon die during production at Norwegian fish farms. Earlier research shows that most farmed salmon die in operations partly related to protection of the wild salmon (from salmon lice), but it is not known how this relates to other conditions positive or negative for fish welfare. Fish farm personnel are experts on the organizational conditions during production. This is thus a study of what fish farm personnel consider contributing to fish welfare. Data are gathered through interviews, observation, and a small-scale survey. The results suggest that the personnel stand in a multiple protection dilemma, where fish welfare loses in a battle with objectives of profitable production, and protection of wild salmon. In this context of conditions emphasizing other objectives, the personnel act as a buffer for farmed fish welfare. In particular, the study indicates that fish health personnel perceive themselves and are perceived as advocates for fish welfare. This important role, and the multiple protection dilemma that comes from the conflict between product and environment, are not earlier described in organizational literature. Multiple protection dilemmas can be relevant for all production in open environment, so personnel and organizations should be structured to reduce and handle it.

AB  - Forests are a large carbon sink with an additional substitution effect in the merchantable timber compartment of harvested trees, where carbon stored within the same volume of wood varies depending on wood density. Here, we investigated mean annual air-dry wood density variations depending on cambial age, annual radial increment, and two different stem heights of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.), Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex. Ledeb., and Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. from a first climatic region (Mulan Forest) and exclusively of P. tabulaeformis from a second climatic region (Zhongtiaoshan Forest) in the temperate zone of China. We applied linear mixed-effects models with partly transformed variables and estimated marginal means for pairwise comparisons. Results showed that mean wood density was not significantly different between L. gmelinii (0.626 g cm(-3)) and Q. mongolica (0.596 g cm(-3)), but significantly different between P. tabulaeformis from the two different climatic regions (0.445 g cm(-3) in Mulan Forest and 0.521 g cm(-3) in Zhongtiaoshan Forest). Mean annual wood density within trees except for P. tabulaeformis from Mulan Forest was initially increasing until an intermediate cambial age, after which it decreased again to lower values. These findings showed that tree age had to be considered in assessing carbon sequestration in wood. It also could play an important role in decision making for forest management in Mulan Forest and show the benefit of the wood properties and carbon storage potential of the faster growing L. gmelinii compared to Q. mongolica. Furthermore, these findings gave an indication that intermediate old forest stands for some tree species accumulated more carbon per year within their woody biomass than young stands or old growth forests. Our results may have an impact on the planning of rotation lengths and of tree species composition for forest stands in Mulan Forest and Zhongtiaoshan Forest.

AB  - Ecosystem services have become an important concept in policy-making. Carbon (C) sequestration into ecosystems is a significant ecosystem service, whereas C losses can be considered as an ecosystem disservice. Municipalities are in a position to make decisions that affect local emissions and therefore are important when considering greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Integrated estimations of fluxes at a regional level help local authorities to develop land use policies for minimising GHG emissions and maximising C sinks. In this study, the Finnish national GHG accounting system is modified and applied at the municipal level by combining emissions and sinks from agricultural land, forest areas, water bodies and mires (land use-related GHG emissions) with emissions from activities such as energy production and traffic (anthropogenic GHG emissions) into the LUONNIKAS calculation tool. The study area consists of 14 municipalities within the Vanajavesi catchment area located in Southern Finland. In these municipalities, croplands, peat extraction sites, water bodies and undrained mires are emission sources, whereas forests are large carbon sinks that turn the land use-related GHG budget negative, resulting in C sequestration into the ecosystem. The annual land use-related sink in the study area was 78 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 2.8 t CO2 eq per capita. Annual anthropogenic GHG emissions from the area amounted to 250 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 9.2 t CO2 eq per capita. Since forests are a significant carbon sink and the efficiency of this sink is heavily affected by forest management practices, forest management policy is a key contributing factor for mitigating municipal GHG emissions.

AB  - Continental shelf sediments are places of both rapid organic carbon turnover and accumulation, while at the same time increasingly subjected to human-induced disturbances. Recent research suggests that shelf sediments might have a role to play as a natural climate solution, e.g. by storing organic carbon if left undisturbed from anthropogenic activity. However, we have an incomplete understanding about the centres of organic carbon accumulation and storage on continental shelves. To better constrain the rate of accumulation and the mass of organic carbon that is stored in sediments, we developed and applied a spatial modelling framework that allows us to estimate those quantities from sparse observations and predictor variables known or suspected to influence the spatial patterns of these parameters. This paper presents spatial distribution patterns of organic carbon densities and accumulation rates in the North Sea and Skagerrak. We found that organic carbon stocks and accumulation rates are highest in the Norwegian Trough, while large parts of the North Sea are characterised by low stocks and zero net accumulation. The total stock of organic carbon that is stored in the upper 0.1 m of sediments amounted to 230.5 +/- 134.5 Tg C, of which approximately 26 % is stored in the Norwegian Trough. Rates of organic carbon accumulation in the Norwegian Trough are comparable with those reported from nearby fjords. We provide baseline datasets that could be used in marine management, e.g. for the establishment of "carbon protection zones". Additionally, we highlight the complex nature of continental shelves with zones of rapid carbon cycling and accumulation juxtaposed, which will require further detailed and spatially explicit analyses to constrain sedimentary organic carbon stocks and accumulation rates globally.

AB  - Transport infrastructure has a wide array of effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and road and railway networks are increasingly being associated with a loss of biodiversity worldwide. Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are two legal frameworks that concern physical planning, with the potential to identify, predict, mitigate and/or compensate transport infrastructure effects with negative impacts on biodiversity. The aim of this study was to review the treatment of ecological impacts in environmental assessment of transport infrastructure plans and projects. A literature review on the topic of EIA, SEA, biodiversity and transport infrastructure was conducted, and 17 problem categories on the treatment of biodiversity were formulated by means of a content analysis. A review of environmental impact statements and environmental reports (EIS/ER) produced between 2005 and 2013 in Sweden and the UK was then conducted using the list of problems as a checklist The results show that the treatment of ecological impacts has improved substantially over the years, but that some impacts remain problematic; the treatment of fragmentation, the absence of quantitative analysis and that the impact assessment study area was in general delimited without consideration for the scales of ecological processes. Actions to improve the treatment of ecological impacts could include improved guidelines for spatial and temporal delimitation, and the establishment of a quantitative framework including tools, methods and threshold values. Additionally, capacity building and further method development of EIA and SEA friendly spatial ecological models can aid in clarifying the costs as well as the benefits in development/biodiversity tradeoffs.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the collembolan communities in anthropogenous birch stands of different origin with each other and with natural forests at the same latitude. Nine sites were investigated: three birch stands (Betula pendula) planted ca. 30 years prior to the study after clear-cutting of spruce stands, three birch stands planted ca. 30 years earlier on arable soil that had been under cultivation until reforestation, and three natural deciduous forests. These were sampled in August and October 1998, and microarthropods were extracted, counted and identified. Thirty years after reforestation, the collembolan communities of "Birch after Spruce" and "Birch after Field" differed significantly, but nevertheless, in comparison to some other soil faunal groups, were relatively similar to each other, and also to the communities of "Natural Deciduous" forests. Average population densities and species diversity were lowest in "Birch after Field". The communities of deciduous forests, either natural or planted, were also relatively similar to those of coniferous forests at the same latitude. Past land-use history, organic matter content, soil structure and texture, acidity and water holding capacity were the most important factors in explaining the observed community structure.

AB  - With an emphasis on integrating national parks into wider regional and local tourism development processes during the latter two decades, protected areas have gradually become more closely connected to their economic and social environments. This presupposes a dynamic approach that involves participatory planning. However, the preservation of nature and wildlife in protected areas remains a source of conflict among different stake-holders. The aim of this study is to explore how key stakeholders, with their different interests at stake, identify dilemmas, challenges, and opportunities in a national park, and to suggest how the various opinions can be integrated in an adaptive management framework for sustainable development. The main results from quali-tative interviews with key stakeholders reveal three components of the adaptive management framework: 1) "Combining a bottom-up/top-down strategy in protected areas", 2) "Channeling different user segments in protected areas", and 3) "The dynamics between protected and surrounding areas". The first component provides opportunities to look at sustainability issues from different perspectives, build alliances on shared values, and improve dialogue and collaboration. The second component may help national park management to maintain conservation values, for example, by using trails and guided tours. The third component may generate more attractive user experiences, guiding tourism suppliers to design and offer more attractive outdoor recreation activities and create attractive environments for economic development.

AB  - Genetic diversity within and among populations and species is influenced by complex demographic and evolutionary processes. Despite extensive research, there is no consensus regarding how landscape structure, spatial distribution, gene flow, and population dynamics impact genetic composition of natural populations. Here, we used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) to investigate effects of population size, geographic isolation, immigration, and gene flow on genetic structure, divergence, and diversity in populations of Tetrix subulata pygmy grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) from 20 sampling locations in southern Sweden. Analyses of 1564 AFLP markers revealed low to moderate levels of genetic diversity (PPL=59.5-90.1; Hj=0.23-0.32) within and significant divergence among sampling localities. This suggests that evolution of functional traits in response to divergent selection is possible and that gene flow is restricted. Genetic diversity increased with population size and with increasing proportion of long-winged phenotypes (a proxy of recent immigration) across populations on the island of oland, but not on the mainland. Our data further suggested that the open water separating oland from the mainland acts as a dispersal barrier that restricts migration and leads to genetic divergence among regions. Isolation by distance was evident for short interpopulation distances on the mainland, but gradually disappeared as populations separated by longer distances were included. Results illustrate that integrating ecological and molecular data is key to identifying drivers of population genetic structure in natural populations. Our findings also underscore the importance of landscape structure and spatial sampling scheme for conclusions regarding the role of gene flow and isolation by distance.

AB  - Plant communities (ground and field layer species) within a wide range of coniferous forest stands across Britain were classified using the National Vegetation Classification, and community composition and diversity related to stand structure and site characteristics. Data were collected from 12 plantation forest sites, encompassing a range of climatic conditions (uplands, foothills, and lowlands), crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine), and crop ages (pre-thicket, mid-rotation, mature and over-mature). Vegetation communities in lowland sites were poorly correlated with semi-natural woodland analogues, with 'goodness-of-fit' coefficients less than 40%. The highest coefficients were obtained for mature and over-mature pine and spruce stands in the uplands and foothills climatic zones. These stands were matched most closely to semi-natural pinewoods and oakwood communities. Principal components analysis produced four summary soil vectors and four habitat structure vectors, that described 84 and 79% of the variability in the site and stand structure data, respectively. These vectors were related to plant community composition, species richness and diversity using canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis. Variation in community composition was related principally to a soil fertility gradient, defined by increasing pH, exchangeable Ca, and available N in NO3- form, coupled with decreases in soil organic matter and N in NH4+ form. Vascular plant and bryophyte species diversity was inversely related to available N.
   Uplands and foothills Scots pine and Sitka spruce sites had plant communities typical of acid, infertile soils, whereas lowland Norway spruce sites had communities associated with high soil fertility.
   Plant community composition and diversity was also significantly related to measures of vertical stand structure. Pre-thicket plots, with high values for field layer vertical cover; had distinctive communities and were more diverse than mid-rotation and mature plots; which had high canopy cover values, and low shrub and field layer cover. A positive relationship was recorded between deadwood volume and bryophyte species diversity, with over-mature Sitka spruce stands in the uplands having particularly high volumes of deadwood due to windthrow. This influence of stand structure suggests that plant community diversity can be enhanced in commercial conifer forests by extending rotation lengths, introducing alternative silvicultural systems such as shelterwood, and increasing deadwood volumes.

LA  - English
AB  - Representation of all ecosystems and species in protected areas is a major goal of nature conservation, but few countries have assessed the degree to which it bas been fulfilled We analyzed the extent to which landscape and habitat types in Sweden are represented in areas protected by the Nature Conservation Act A total of 1175 national parks, nature reserves, and nature conservation areas comprised 4.7% of the total Swedish territory on 31 December 1986 (the proportion increased to 5.9% in 1990). Among landscape types, a very large area of alpine landscape was protected, but only a small area of river landscape Among habitat types, subalpine birch forest and alpine heaths showed the highest degree of representation in protected areas (32% and 30%, respectively, of the total area of each habitat type). Less than 1% of the farmland and less than 2% of the coniferous forests were represented in protected areas. During an early (1969-66) and a late (1967-86) conservation Period, 30% and 70%, respectively, of the protected area was established During the early period protection of alpine areas predominated; during the late period higher proportions of the other habitat types were protected, suggesting that representation was considered increasingly important. We discuss three factors that influence the goal of representation: (1) threat to and amount of remaining habitat type, (2) cost and opportunity, and (3) evaluation criteria and history. Further inventory of communities and species as well as understanding of ecological processes, in and outside of protected areas, are necessary in future conservation work.

AB  - Metacommunity theory emphasizes that seed dispersal not only limits but equally maintains plant diversity, though the latter receives little empirical attention. Discerning the temporal and spatial components of seed dispersal and understanding how their interaction shapes fragmented communities and maintains their diversity may be pivotal to further our ecological understanding of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and its implications for landscape-scale conservation management. To investigate the relative importance of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and their roles in maintaining plant diversity, the herb layer and seed bank of grassland communities were inventoried in 77 sites across abandoned and intact rotational grazing networks in a 100 km(2) fragmented grassland landscape in the Stockholm archipelago (Baltic Sea, Sweden). Besides analysing alpha- and beta-diversity patterns, nestedness analyses connect deterministic community changes and diversity losses with dispersal-related life-history traits and habitat specialization to identify the mechanism driving community changes and maintaining local diversity. The loss of rotational grazing networks caused community diversity declines via non-random extinctions of spatially and temporally poor dispersers, particularly among grassland specialists. Temporal seed dispersal halted further community disassembly, maintaining diversity in the abandoned grazing networks. Spatial dispersal within the intact grazing networks was found to be an overriding, homogenizing agent conserving diversity in both the herb layer and seed bank. This empirical evidence establishes how spatial and temporal seed dispersal interact to maintain diversity in fragmented landscapes. Poorly connected grasslands appear limited by spatial dispersal, yet are maintained by temporal seed dispersal. In fragmented landscapes where grazing networks are rarely present, temporal rather than spatial seed dispersal may be more important in maintaining species diversity, since effective spatial dispersal may be significantly diminished. The grazing network's efficacy at boosting spatial dispersal and upholding community diversity presents a powerful management tool to conserve local and regional species diversity.

AB  - The role of dead wood in forests encompasses the preservation of biodiversity, productivity, and the storage of carbon. In this study we aimed to investigate the variation of the dead wood volume in a subalpine Norway spruce forest. Using a regular grid, we recorded the size of the wood ordered in a five-class scale for snags and logs and a six-class scale for stumps. The relationship between the dead wood volume and a series of site and stand characteristics was modelled by means of some predictive factors (stand age, altitude, human influence and site productivity) using generalized linear/nonlinear models. Dead wood volume (74.3 m 3.ha(-1)) accounted for 18.3 % of the volume (live trees and dead wood). Regarding the dead wood only, snags amounted to 44.8 % of the volume and logs and stumps amounted to 46.5, and 8.7 %, respectively. Snags (57.5 % of the total) and logs (42.8 %), were most common in the 2nd decay class, while stumps were most common in the 6th one (51.2 %). The distribution of the number of dead wood pieces, in terms of diameter, was obtained according to the Meyer theoretical distribution for snags and to the Gamma theoretical distribution for logs and stumps. This study completes the dead wood database from Norway spruce forests in the subalpine area to find the common features across the Carpathians Mountains. It contributes to the understanding of the dead wood dynamics in a young National Park, considering the year of establishment. This park consists of forests where forestry work was carried out and stands were exempt from cutting.

AB  - We introduce a multistep modeling approach for studying optimal management of fertilizer inputs in a situation where soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics and water and atmosphere externalities are considered. The three steps in the modeling process are: (1) generation of the data sets with a detailed simulation model; (2) estimation of the system models from the data; (3) application of the obtained dynamic economic optimization model considering inorganic and organic fertilizer inputs. We demonstrate the approach with a case study: barley production in southern Finland on coarse and clay soils. Our results show that there is a synergy between climate change mitigation and water protection goals, and a trade-off between pollution mitigation and crop production goals. If a field is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an insignificant source of water pollution, atmospheric externalities dominate the water externalities, even for a relatively low social cost of carbon (SCC). If a field is a significant source of water pollution, the SCC would have to be very high before atmospheric externalities dominate water externalities. In addition, an integrated nutrient management system appears better than a system in which only inorganic or organic fertilizer is used, although manure is not a solution to agriculture's GHG emissions problem. Moreover, GHG emissions and nitrogen and carbon leaching mitigation efforts should first be targeted at coarse soils rather than clay soils, because the marginal abatement costs are considerably lower for coarse soils.

AB  - Oulanka National Park, Finland aims to ensure nature conservation while providing high quality visitor experiences. The growth of outdoor recreation and nature tourism, however, has fueled concern about consequent pressures on the natural resources of the park. This analysis assessed the spatial relationship between biodiversity hotspots and visitor distributions within Oulanka National Park. Known occurrences of rare or threatened species (lichen, moss, fungi, and vascular plants) within the park were used as indicators of biodiversity. Areas with a high density of threatened and endangered species (i.e. biodiversity hotspots) were identified through kernel density analysis and compared to the spatial distribution of visitor use within the park. Results indicate important habitats for endangered species are often located nearby or on the edge of high visitor use zones leaving them vulnerable to human impacts. Further research will investigate the relationships between visitor experiences at specific spots and acceptance of nature management measures.

AB  - Carrying capacity is defined as the maximum biomass of a farmed species that can be supported without violating the maximum acceptable impacts to the farmed stock and its environment. Maximum acceptable impacts on the farmed stock and the environment are expressed by standards for water quality in the farm and the surrounding environment. Environmental quality standards are established in a political process. The scientific part of the problem to estimate the carrying capacity is to develop reliable, objective methods or models for estimating the response of both the environment and the farmed stock to farming. Using such models together with field observations from a specified locality and the quality standards in force, the carrying capacity for the locality can be estimated. Models must properly deal with hydrodynamic and biogeochemical and ecological processes in the environment as well as with oxygen consumption and sources and sinks of organic matter and nutrients due to farm activity. In this paper, the basic principles of model construction are discussed and the Norwegian MOM model is used as an example. Current speed data and farm activity data are identified as two generally large sources of uncertainty in estimates of environmental impact and carrying capacity.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide ecosystem properties fundamental to the provision of ecosystem services, such as the sequestration of carbon and nutrients and serving as a reservoir for organic matter. Although, urban vegetation influences soil physico-chemical properties, it remains unknown whether ecosystem properties depend on plant species portfolios. We tested the influence of three common functional plant groups (evergreen trees, deciduous trees, grass/lawn) for their ability to modify soils in parks of various ages under cold climatic conditions in Finland. We hypothesized that (i) plant functional groups affect soils differently resulting in divergent ecosystem properties, and (ii) that these ecosystem properties also depend on park age. We included 41 urban parks of varying ages (10, 50, and >100 years) and additional control forests. Park soils were sampled for physico-chemical parameters up to 50 cm depth. Our data indicate that plant functional groups modify soils differently, especially between the evergreen and lawn treatments at 50 and >100 year old parks. Soils under evergreen trees had the lowest pH and generally the highest percentage organic matter, percentage total carbon and percentage total nitrogen. Soil pH remained the same, whereas concentrations of organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen declined by depth. Soils in the reference forests had lower pH but higher percentages organic matter, total carbon, and total nitrogen than those in parks. We estimate that old parks with evergreen trees can store 35.5 and 2.3 kg N m(-2)-considerably more than in urban soils in warmer climates. Our data suggest that plant-soil interactions in urban parks, in spite of being constructed environments, are surprisingly similar to those in natural forests.

AB  - Traditional, pre-industrial farming was adapted to the natural environment-topography, geology, hydrology, climate, and biota. Traditional land use systems are still to be traced in Scandinavia as an "infield/outland landscape", and in Japan as a "Satoyama landscape." There are obvious similarities and differences in land use-the main difference being that pasturing of cattle and sheep has been less important in Japan. These land use systems can be traced back to early sedentary settlements 1500-2500 years ago. In both regions, traditional management almost ceased in the mid-twentieth century leading to afforestation and decreased biological diversity. Today, there is in Japan a growing movement for landscape restoration and promotion of a sustainable living countryside based on local agrarian and forestry production, local energy, tourism, etc. With this background, the so-called Satoyama Initiative has been organized and introduced as a global socio-ecological project with ecosystem services for human well-being.

AB  - Forests act as carbon sinks and can make significant contributions to climate change mitigation efforts. In Norway, family forest owners own 80% of productive forestland and play a central role in the management of the country's forests. Yet little is known about whether these landowners would be interested in increasing carbon sequestration on their land and selling carbon credits. Only a handful of studies have examined the factors that motivate family forest owners to participate in carbon offset programs, and all of these studies have been conducted in the United States. This study addresses this information gap using data from a mail survey of 1500 Norwegian family forest owners. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the effect of various carbon program, forestland, and landowner characteristics on participation in a hypothetical carbon offset program. Results suggest that there is a considerable amount of interest among Norwegian family forest owners and that the most important predictors of participation are payment amount offered, perceived barriers posed by management actions, importance placed on non-market forest amenities, and attitudes towards climate change.

AB  - The growing stock more than doubled from 1.6 to 3.4 million m(3) between 1912 and 2005 in forests on an area of 387 km(2) in southern Finland. The stock expansion continued for 93 years noting interim results, which were available for 1959,1982,1994 and 1999. Forested area in the region hardly changed. Carbon sequestration was mainly a result of a long-term recovery from forest degradation, a legacy of land use in the 18th and 19th centuries. Tree demography responded to management change especially of mature stands: Average tree size and stocking density of stands increased. On average the expanding biomass stock sequestered 18 tons C annually per km(2) (18 g C per m(2)). In comparison, the emissions of fossil carbon in the region were estimated at 12 tons C per km 2 (12 g C per m(2)) on average. However, fossil CO2 emissions exceeded biomass sequestration in recent decades. The powerful and persistent expansion of the carbon stock was an unintended co-benefit of forestry, which was motivated by the intention to improve timber yield. On the more negative side the change in management introduced clear-cuts, and a loss of diverse elements of the pre-industrial biota. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) is one of the most economically important European coniferous species. With the expected decline of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), the importance of this tree species may increase in the afforestation of new areas and subsequent CO2 fixation in the context of climate change mitigation if its wood production and quality relative to spruce is high enough. This study aims to assess the suitability of larch for afforestation of former agricultural land compared to spruce, not only in regards to production and stand structure, but also the quality of the wood produced - wood density, shrinkage, and compression strength. The monospecific stands and wood of both species from afforested agricultural land were compared with original forest land in the Orlicke hory Mountains (Czech Republic) based on 24 measured research plots, and 598 trees. The biomass of larch stands aged 66-71 years was significantly higher on agricultural land (506 t ha(-1)) compared to forest land (399 t ha(-1)), similar to spruce (508 vs. 314 t ha(-1)), with no difference between tree species detected. By contrast, larch stands achieved higher structural differentiation and complex diversity when compared to spruce, especially on forest land. For both species, the stands on forest land also showed a lower proportion of stem rot (32%) compared to agricultural land (67%). Primarily, lower (by 10%) incidence of parasitic fungal infestation of larch was observed compared to spruce. Regarding wood quality, a significant effect of land use on wood density was confirmed for both species. Larch is therefore clearly a suitable alternative to spruce for the afforestation of former agricultural land without impact on fungal pathogens and deterioration of wood quality. Moreover, larch and spruce stands on afforested agricultural land have a high production potential and biomass carbon sequestration (by +45% on average) compared to forest land.

AB  - 1. This paper introduces key messages from a number of papers emanating from the Second International Symposium on Riverine Landscapes held in August 2004 in Sweden, focusing on river restoration. Together these papers provide an overview of the science of river restoration, and point out future research needs.
   2. Restoration tests the feasibility of recreating complex ecosystems from more simple and degraded states, thereby presenting a major challenge to ecological science. Therefore, close cooperation between practitioners and scientists would be beneficial, but most river restoration projects are currently performed with little or no scientific involvement.
   3. Key messages emanating from this series of papers are: The scope, i.e. the maximum and minimum spatial extent and temporal duration of habitat use, of species targeted for restoration should be acknowledged, so that all relevant stages in their life cycles are considered. Species that have been lost from a stream cannot be assumed to recolonise spontaneously, calling for strategies to ensure the return of target species to-be integrated into projects. Possible effects of invasive exotic species also need to be incorporated into project plans, either to minimise the impact of exotics, or to modify the expected outcome of restoration in cases where extirpation of exotics is impractical.
   4. Restoration of important ecological processes often implies improving connectivity of the stream. For example, longitudinal and lateral connectivity can be enhanced by restoring fluvial dynamics on flood-suppressed rivers and by increasing water availability in rivers subject to water diversion or withdrawal, thereby increasing habitat and species diversity. Restoring links between surface and ground water flow enhances vertical connectivity and communities associated with the hyporheic zone.
   5. Future restoration schemes should consider where in the catchment to locate projects to make restoration most effective, consider the cumulative effects of many small projects, and evaluate the potential to restore ecosystem processes under highly constrained conditions such as in urban areas. Moreover, restoration projects should be properly monitored to assess whether restoration has been successful, thus enabling adaptive management and learning for the future from both successful and unsuccessful restorations.

AB  - Lack of natural disturbances and the homogenization of boreal forest because of intensive forest management pose a threat to biodiversity and can endanger the provision of ecosystem services. In this study, we assessed how two methods aimed to promote biodiversity, i.e. prescribed fire and retention forestry (RET), affect ecosystem services supported by bilberry and lingonberry in Scots pine-dominated boreal forests. Shrub cover, flowering, berry yield and percent fruit set of both shrubs were measured and bees were sampled by pan-traps on 24 study sites 13 years following a large-scale experiment, where RET (0, 10, 50 m(3)/ha and uncut forests) and fire (yes/no) were manipulated following a replicated factorial design. In general, bilberry performance and reproduction were higher at uncut sites, while lingonberly flowering was positively affected by fire and retention. Bee community composition was mainly determined by percentage of bare ground and number of logs within sites, both nesting resources largely determined by fire and retention. Burnt sites with retention trees serve as pollinator source habitats and contain floral resources, highlighting the importance of natural disturbances and biological legacies in the conservation of pollination services from boreal forests.

AB  - Question: We asked how landscape configuration and present management influence plant species richness and abundance of habitat specialists in grasslands in a 'modern' (much exploited and transformed) agricultural Swedish landscape.
   Location: Selaon, south-eastern Sweden (59 degrees 24' N, 17 degrees 10' E).
   Methods: Present and past ( 150 and 50 years ago) landscape pattern was analysed in a 25 km(2) area. Species richness was investigated in 63 different grassland patches; grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. and razed ex-arable fields. Influence of landscape variables; area, past and present grassland connectivity. present management on total species richness. density and abundance of 25 grassland specialists was analysed.
   Results: Semi-natural grasslands (permanent unfertilised pastures or meadows formed by traditional agricultural methods) had declined from 60% 150 years ago to 5% today. There was a significant decline in species richness and density in abandoned serni-natUral grasslands. Total species richness was influenced by present management. size and connectivity to present and past grassland pattern. Landscape variables did not influence species density in grazed semi-natural grassland Suggesting that maintained grazing management makes grassland patches independent of landscape context. The abundance of 16 grassland specialists was Mainly influenced by management and to some extent also by landscape variables.
   Conclusion: Although species richness pattern reflect management and to some extent landscape variables, the response of individual species may be idiosyncratic. The historical signal from past landscapes is weak on present-day species richness in highly transformed, agricultural landscapes. Generalizations of historical legacies on species diversity in grasslands should consider also highly transformed landscapes and not only landscapes with a high amount of diversity hotspots left.

AB  - Sustainable development of the salmon farming industry requires knowledge of the biogeochemical impacts of fish farm emissions. To investigate the spatial and temporal scales of farm impacts on the water column and benthic biogeochemistry, we coupled the C-N-P-Si-O-S-Mn-Fe transformation model BROM with a 2-dimensional benthic-pelagic transport model (2DBP), considering vertical and horizontal transport in the water and upper 5 cm of sediments along a 10 km transect centered on a fish farm. The 2DBP model was forced by hydrophysical model data for the Hardangerfjord in western Norway. Model simulations showed reasonable agreement with field data from the Hardangerfjord in August 2016 (correlations between the model and observations were significant for most variables, and model biases were mostly <35%). The model predicted significant impacts on seafloor biogeochemistry up to 1 km from the fish farm (e.g., increased organic matter in sediments, oxygen depletion in bottom water and sediments, denitrification, metal and sulfur reduction), as well as detectable decreases in oxygen and increases in ammonium, phosphate and organic matter in the surface water near to the fish farm.

AB  - Forests have two notable economic roles in the future: providing renewable raw material and storing carbon to mitigate climate change. The pricing of forest carbon leads to longer rotation times and consequently larger carbon stocks, but also exposes landowners to a greater risk of forest damage. This paper investigates optimal forest rotation under carbon pricing and forest damage risk. I provide the first-order optimality conditions for this problem and illustrate the setting with numerical calculations representing boreal forests. Under the considered range of parametrization, carbon price has far greater impact on the optimal rotation than the damage probability. Increasing forest carbon stocks through longer rotations is thus economically attractive option for mitigating climate change, despite the forest damage risk. Carbon pricing increases land expectation value and reduces the economic risks posed by disturbances. The production possibility frontier between harvests and carbon storage suggests that significantly larger forests carbon stocks are achievable, but implies lower harvests. However, forests' societally optimal role between these two activities is not yet clear-cut; but rests on the future development of relative prices between timber, carbon and other commodities dependent on land-use.

AB  - Perspectives on the Environmental Implications of Sustainable Hydropower gathers scientific papers from three of the worlds most important hydropower producers to discuss aspects of sustainable hydropower and the means by which it can be studied and achieved. The papers examine the application and use of new technologies and protocols for studying hydropower, adaptive management and the implications and use of long-term data sets for minimizing hydropower impacts on fish populations. The papers include a cross section of biological and hydrological experts. The implicit among country comparisons highlight a number of common hydropower themes, particularly the need to expand from single species studies to include broader consideration of the ecosystem, the importance of maintaining habitat, trait and species diversity and the need for consistently collected long-term data sets.

AB  - Developing nature-based tourism in private lands calls for new mechanisms to consolidate the interests of the tourism industry, visitors, and landowners. This choice experiment study elaborates on the heterogeneity of visitors' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for enhanced forest amenities and ecosystem services. The survey, targeting domestic and foreign tourists visiting the Ruka-Kuusamo area in Finland, considered four attributes: landscape quality, outdoor routes, forest biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. For observed heterogeneity, the visitors were grouped by their attitudes towards forest management. Unobserved heterogeneity in visitors' choice behaviour and WTP was examined with the latent class model. While most visitors had environmentally friendly attitudes and were willing to pay, especially for enhanced landscape quality and biodiversity, considerable heterogeneity was revealed in terms of three segments with distinctive attitudes, choice behaviour and WTP. The variation in WTP has important implications for the design of a scheme of payments for environmental management.

AB  - Forest ecosystems in Europe are expected to experience changes in temperature and water regimes associated with increased risks of extreme environmental events and disasters. Genetic diversity and relatedness has been linked to resilience of forest stands and landscapes. Genetic diversity indicators were compared between a Norway spruce population naturally regenerated after extensive windthrow and Norway spruce progeny populations derived from two seed orchards. In addition, genetic diversity in an undisturbed stand in a long established national park and a spruce genetic resource stand were analyzed. Populations were genotyped at 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Average genetic diversity indicators were similar across populations. However, the total number of alleles, average number of alleles over all loci, effective number of alleles, average gene diversity, and average allelic richness were highest in the naturally regenerated population and lowest in one of the seed orchard progeny populations. The genetic diversity in progeny from seed orchards used for stand renewal is comparable to the genetic diversity in naturally regenerated stands. However, fluctuations in seed production between years can have a large impact on genetic diversity in seed orchard progeny. The use of improved Norway spruce germplasm deployed via clonal seed orchards for forest renewal can maintain similar levels of genetic diversity compared to naturally regenerated stands, while also increasing production and timber quality.

AB  - Following the growth of nature-based tourism, national parks and other protected areas have become important tourist attractions and tools for regional development. Meanwhile, research on the impact of nature on human health and well-being is increasing and taken into account in park management. This study examines health and well-being benefits perceived by visitors to Finland's protected areas. It is based on survey data from five national parks and one strict nature reserve in 2013-2015: an on-site visitor survey (N = 3152) and an Internet-based health and well-being survey (N = 1054). The study indicates that visitors' perceived benefits to their well-being were highly positive. Visits to protected areas promoted psychological, physical, and social benefits. In particular, park visits were found to provide strong and multi-faceted, long-lasting, embodied and sensory well-being experiences as well as escape from everyday life and work. Overnight visitors reported more well-being benefits than day visitors, and different types of park had different well-being benefits. The study suggests that the potential benefits of protected areas for public health are significant, emphasizing the need to integrate health and well-being arguments into the neoliberalist politics assessing the economic benefits of protected areas and their role in regional development.

AB  - Uncultivated field margins are one of the most frequent non-crop habitat types in contemporary, high-intensity agricultural landscapes and may therefore be important for the persistence of many farmland species. Managing field margins in a way that preserves, and preferably enhances, their value for biodiversity is therefore important. In the present study, we evaluate how the flora of uncultivated field margins is affected by the removal of woody vegetation as prescribed by an agri-environment scheme (AES) under the Swedish Rural Development Program 2007-2013. We used generalized linear mixed models and detrended correspondence analysis to compare the flora of open (cleared) and more overgrown field margins, located within agricultural landscapes of different complexity, in Scania, S. Sweden. As expected, there was a negative effect of management on woody species. However, the local (1 m(2)) and transect (100 m) level richness of non-woody species did not differ significantly between management categories, and there were no differences in the within-transect variability of non-woody species (local beta diversity) or the species composition (0.25 m(2) plots) in managed and unmanaged field margins. Our results show that the removal of woody vegetation from uncultivated field margins, as prescribed by the evaluated AES, is unlikely to benefit non-woody plant species. The species composition of the sampled field margins suggests that inclusion of appropriate field layer management alone is unlikely to be sufficient to improve habitat conditions for grassland species unless measures are taken to counteract eutrophication. Landscape type, on the other hand, influenced both the total richness and the richness of each of the species groups that were considered to be of particular conservation value in the present study: field margins in the complex agricultural landscapes were significantly richer than those in the simple ones. Maintaining non-crop habitat at the landscape scale is likely to be a necessary first step in the prevention of a further decline of farmland plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Distinction between active and legacy sources of nutrients is needed for effective reduction of waterborne nutrient loads and associated eutrophication. This study quantifies main typological differences in nutrient load behaviour versus water discharge for active and legacy sources. This quantitative typology is used for source attribution based on monitoring data for water discharge and concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) from 37 catchments draining into the Baltic Sea along the coastline of Sweden over the period 2003-2013. Results indicate dominant legacy source contributions to the monitored loads of TN and TP in most (33 of the total 37) study catchments. Dominant active sources are indicated in 1 catchment for TN, and mixed sources are indicated in 3 catchments for TN, and 4 catchments for TP. The TN and TP concentration contributions are quantified to be overall higher from the legacy than the active sources. Legacy concentrations also correlate well with key indicators of human activity in the catchments, agricultural land share for TN (R-2 = 0.65) and population density for TP (R-2 = 0.56). Legacy-dominated nutrient concentrations also change more slowly than in catchments with dominant active or mixed sources. Various data-based results and indications converge in indicating legacy source contributions as largely dominant, mainly anthropogenic, and with near-zero average change trends in the present study of catchments draining into the Baltic Sea along the coastline of Sweden, as in other parts of the world. These convergent indications emphasize needs to identify and map the different types of sources in each catchment, and differentiate strategies and measures to target each source type for possible achievement of shorter- and longer-term goals of water quality improvement.

AB  - As initiatives are taken in Sweden to evaluate the geological potential for carbon dioxide storage in the adjacent Baltic Sea, experiences from elsewhere may provide lessons about perceptions of and potential opposition toward carbon capture and storage (CCS). A comprehensive analysis of storage feasibility needs to include the issue of social acceptance. The knowledge of CCS is low in Sweden however and there are no Swedish CCS projects to learn from. This paper therefore draws on lessons from other large-scale energy projects that are embedded in similar Baltic Sea contexts to complement lessons on CCS acceptance provided in the literature. The aim of this study is to facilitate an understanding of acceptance of potential future CO2 storage initiatives in the Swedish Baltic Sea region and to analyze what contextual factors are likely to be determinative of the outcome of these and similar projects. The study identifies climate change as one such key contextual factor, which can often be used both to support and oppose a large-scale energy project. Furthermore, the study finds that there are perceptions of uncertainties regarding the regulatory framework that need to be adressed in order to facilitate the planning of CCS projects in the region.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is important in maintaining soil fertility and other ecosystem functions. Yet, land management in intensive agriculture has caused SOM level to decrease, with knock-on effects for soil fertility and quality. Therefore, land management options that ensure that SOM is not depleted and that soil functions are better sustained are of increasing interest. However, there is limited knowledge on how different land managements affect the composition of SOM and associated microbial functional profiles. Twelve long-term field experiments, covering a wide range of climatic zones and soil types, were selected in Sweden. They focused on the role of combining ley in crop rotations with the manure application (livestock farm), as opposed to the management without ley and receiving only inorganic fertilizer (arable farm). In ten out of the 12 study sites, livestock farm management tended to have higher proportions of aliphatic and double bonded C groups, as estimated by mid-infrared spectroscopy. This was further confirmed by C-13 NMR analysis, which found greater proportions of O-alkyl and di-O-alkyl groups and less aromatic C in livestock farm than arable farm management in five of the eight sites analyzed. The changes in SOM composition were reflected in microbial functional profiles across many sites: soils from livestock farm management utilized more carbohydrates and amino acids, while polymer and aromatic compounds were associated with arable farm management. Overall, shifts in both microbial functional profiles and SOM composition showed great consistency across geographical and climatic zones. Livestock farm management maintained higher levels of microbial functional diversity and were associated with higher proportions of "reactive" C functional groups. Our investigation demonstrates that livestock farm management could maintain soil fertility over the long-term via the changes in SOM composition and the regulation of microbial functional profiles.

AB  - In regions with low cover of natural forests and high cover of plantations predominately comprised of non-native species, inclusion of a native tree species with a more productive non-native species has the potential to enhance biodiversity and meet production goals. In this context, we tested the alternative hypotheses that: (i) equitable mixes of a non-native and a native tree species support greater diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods than single species stands; or, (ii) native ash stands support greater diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods than mixed or single species stands that include a non-native conifer species. Active epigaeic spiders (Araneae) and beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Staphylinidae) were sampled using pitfall traps in three forest types in Ireland: single species stands of non-native Norway spruce (Picea abies) or native ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and mixed stands of these species.
   Stands of Norway spruce did not negatively influence spider and staphylinid diversity, suggesting that they maintain a similar range of biodiversity to mixed plantations or stands of native ash. However, carabid beetle richness (but not abundance) was negatively affected by the presence of spruce suggesting caution when drawing conclusions about biodiversity impacts from single taxon studies. We found that equitable mixes of spruce and ash supported many species associated with native ash stands. Thus, we recommend that mixes with an equitable species ratio (e.g. 50:50) and containing a native species will enhance epigaeic arthropod diversity and heterogeneity in plantations. Furthermore, our finding that ash stands supported greater beta diversity than spruce stands supports current guidelines that recommend a range of stand types, including native species, to enhance diversity within and between stands.

AB  - Environmental conventions aim to protect ecosystem structures and functions to provide goods and services for mankind. The degree of aquatic ecosystem naturalness, or ecological status as it is defined in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union, is notionally linked to supplies of ecosystem services. In practice, these links have rarely been documented or even investigated, and to justify conservation and management objectives based on the status indicators, it is essential to demonstrate their relationships to ecosystem functions and services. The WFD requires member states to classify their surface waters aiming to achieve good ecological status of water bodies. However, an implicit assumption of the WFD, that the ecosystem functions and services targeted to be protected and maintained are related to the measured status, remains uncertain. Using a time-series data set covering almost 50years, we examined the development of ecological status of eight sub-basins of a large boreal lake in response to improved wastewater management and decreasing pollution. We particularly evaluated whether the observed descriptors of biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services were associated with the judgements of ecological status, and hence whether the ecological status is a relevant proxy for ecosystem values to be protected. The ecological status of the polluted sub-basins responded consistently to the decreased nutrient and organic loading. Temporal trends in the biological quality elements and water quality were mostly parallel and showed good status roughly simultaneously. Combined ecological status also appeared to predict some features of taxon diversity (profundal macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton richness), ecosystem functions (primary and bacterial production) and ecosystem services (fish catch and reproductive potential of coregonids). Synthesis and applications. We observed that some ecosystem service supplies and taxon diversity increased with increasing ecological status of the lake. Therefore, our results suggest that ecological status estimates based on simple structural characters are relevant to the ultimate management goals of maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services and hence might suffice for extensive assessment and monitoring of lake ecosystems.

AB  - Deliberative valuation of ecosystem services is expected to capture the diversity of values related to ecosystem services and to facilitate learning and reconsideration of previously held preferences and positions. This paper reports on a study of a deliberative non-monetary valuation process that was designed to address the value of peatland ecosystem services in Southern Finland. Three parallel citizen panels were organised in order to consider the relative merits of energy peat extraction and peatland protection and to assign value to peatland ecosystem services. The results suggest that increased understanding of peatlands? role in carbon storage, together with reflection on the underlying value positions, led the panellists to adopt a more critical view of energy peat use. All three panels came independently to the same conclusion that peat extraction should be gradually phased out and replaced with renewable energy production. The results also sustain the hypothesis that deliberative settings evoke citizen preferences as the arguments used in the discussions were predominantly public spirited, referring to the common good instead of individual interests. We discuss the outcomes and factors that influenced the deliberations and make recommendations for effective deliberative designs.

AB  - Forests are important components of the greenhouse gas balance of Europe. There is considerable uncertainty about how predicted changes to climate and nitrogen deposition will perturb the carbon and nitrogen cycles of European forests and thereby alter forest growth, carbon sequestration and N2O emission. The present study aimed to quantify the carbon and nitrogen balance, including the exchange of greenhouse gases, of European forests over the period 2010-2030, with a particular emphasis on the spatial variability of change. The analysis was carried out for two tree species: European beech and Scots pine. For this purpose, four different dynamic models were used: BASFOR, DailyDayCent, INTEGRATOR and Landscape-DNDC. These models span a range from semi-empirical to complex mechanistic. Comparison of these models allowed assessment of the extent to which model predictions depended on differences in model inputs and structure. We found a European average carbon sink of 0.160 +/- 0.020 kgC m(-2) yr(-1) (pine) and 0.138 +/- 0.062 kgC m(-2) yr(-1) (beech) and N2O source of 0.285 +/- 0.125 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) (pine) and 0.575 +/- 0.105 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) (beech). The European average greenhouse gas potential of the carbon sink was 18 (pine) and 8 (beech) times that of the N2O source. Carbon sequestration was larger in the trees than in the soil. Carbon sequestration and forest growth were largest in central Europe and lowest in northern Sweden and Finland, N. Poland and S. Spain. No single driver was found to dominate change across Europe. Forests were found to be most sensitive to change in environmental drivers where the drivers were limiting growth, where changes were particularly large or where changes acted in concert. The models disagreed as to which environmental changes were most significant for the geographical variation in forest growth and as to which tree species showed the largest rate of carbon sequestration. Pine and beech forests were found to have differing sensitivities to environmental change, in particular the response to changes in nitrogen and precipitation, with beech forest more vulnerable to drought. There was considerable uncertainty about the geographical location of N2O emissions. Two of the models BASFOR and LandscapeDNDC had largest emissions in central Europe where nitrogen deposition and soil nitrogen were largest, whereas the two other models identified different regions with large N2O emission. N2O emissions were found to be larger from beech than pine forests and were found to be particularly sensitive to forest growth.

AB  - Large boreal rivers in Sweden are generally impounded by hydropower dams and a large proportion of main stem shallow flowing habitats have been lost. Tributaries often con-tain the last undisturbed habitats and could be important for the conservation of species diversity. In particular, tributary mouth areas could be biodiversity hot-spots, due to their vicinity to the main stem and favorable environmental conditions. In this study, we inves-tigate whether tributary mouth areas in two impounded boreal rivers (Ume River and Lule River) could be regarded as biodiversity hot-spots for fish. Based on standardized elec-trofishing in 20 tributary mouths, we find that overall fish diversity is generally low. The highest species richness and diversity was found in mouth areas dominated by intermedi-ate substrate sizes (gravel - cobble). Few, if any, species were found in areas where fine sediments (smaller than sand) dominated. The tributary mouth areas had similar species richness and diversity as areas in the tributaries located 1-km upstream of the mouth, but the fish community composition often differed between these two types of sites. Manage-ment action favoring fish diversity in the tributary mouth areas could include protection or rehabilitation of areas dominated by medium sized substrate and reduction of erosion and transport of fine sediments in the tributaries. Overall, we find no support for trib-utary mouths being hot-spots for fish biodiversity and while some patterns in diversity gives hints on suitable management action, it is important to further understand impacts in tributaries and their mouths and the temporal dynamics of the fish community.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background and aims Forest management towards increased carbon (C) sequestration has repeatedly been suggested as a "natural climate solution". We evaluated the potential of altered management to increase C sequestration in boreal Pinus sylvestris forest plantations. Methods At 29 forest sites, distributed along a 1300 km latitudinal gradient in Sweden, we studied interactive effects of fertilization and thinning on accumulation of C in standing biomass and the organic horizon over a 40 year period. Results Abstention from thinning increased the total C stock by 50% on average. The increase was significant (14% on average) even when C in the removed timber was included in the total ecosystem C pool. Fertilization of thinned stands increased stocks similarly regardless of including (11%) or excluding (12%) removed biomass, and fertilization combined with abstention from thinning had a synergistic effect on C stocks that generated an increase of 79% (35% when removed timber was included in the C stock). A positive effect of fertilization on C stocks was observed along the entire gradient but was greater in relative terms at high latitudes. Fertilization also reduced soil respiration rates. Conclusion Taken together, our results suggest that changed forest management practices have major potential to increase the C sink of boreal forests. Although promising, these benefits should be evaluated against the undesired effects that such management can have on economic revenue, timber quality, biodiversity and delivery of other ecosystem services.

AB  - There is a rivalry between policies on intensification of forest management to meet the demands of a growing bioeconomy, and policies on green infrastructure functionality. Evaluation of the net effects of different policy instruments on real-world outcomes is crucial. First, we present data on final felling rates in wood production landscapes and stand age distribution dynamic in two case study regions, and changes in dead wood amounts in Sweden. Second, the growth of formally protected areas was compiled and changes in functional connectivity analysed in these regions, and the development of dead wood and green tree retention in Sweden was described. The case studies were the counties Dalarna and Jamtland (77,000 km(2)) representing an expanding frontier of boreal forest transformation. In the wood production landscape, official final felling rates averaged 0.84%/year, extending the regional timber frontier. The amount of forest <60 years old increased from 27-34% in 1955 to 60-65% in 2017. The amounts of dead wood, a key forest naturalness indicator, declined from 1994 to 2016 in north Sweden, and increased in the south, albeit both at levels far below evidence-based biodiversity targets. Formal forest protection grew rapidly in the two counties from 1968 to 2020 but reached only 4% of productive forests. From 2000 to 2019, habitat network functionality for old Scots pine declined by 15-41%, and Norway spruce by 15-88%. There were mixed trends for dead wood and tree retention at the stand scale. The net result of the continued transformation of near-natural forest remnants and conservation efforts was negative at the regional and landscape levels, but partly positive at the stand scale. However, at all three scales, habitat amounts were far below critical thresholds for the maintenance of viable populations of species, let alone ecological integrity. Collaboration among stakeholder categories should reject opinionated narratives, and instead rely on evidence-based knowledge about green infrastructure pressures, responses, and states.

AB  - Traditional farming landscapes in the temperate zone that have persisted for millennia can be exceptionally species-rich and are therefore key conservation targets. In contrast to Europe's West, Eastern Europe harbours widespread traditional farming landscapes, but drastic socio-economic and political changes in the twentieth century are likely to have impacted these landscapes profoundly. We reconstructed long-term land-use/cover and biodiversity changes over the last 150 years in a traditional farming landscape of outstanding species diversity in Transylvania. We used the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites model applied to a pollen record from the Transylvanian Plain and a suite of historical and satellite-based maps. We documented widespread changes in the extent and location of grassland and cropland, a loss of wood pastures as well as a gradual increase in forest extent. Land management in the socialist period (1947-1989) led to grassland expansion, but grassland diversity decreased due to intensive production. Land-use intensity has declined since the collapse of socialism in 1989, resulting in widespread cropland abandonment and conversion to grassland. However, these trends may be temporary due to both ongoing woody encroachment as well as grassland management intensification in productive areas. Remarkably, only 8% of all grasslands existed throughout the entire time period (1860-2010), highlighting the importance of land-use history when identifying target areas for conservation, given that old-growth grasslands are most valuable in terms of biodiversity. Combining datasets from different disciplines can yield important additional insights into dynamic landscape and biodiversity changes, informing conservation actions to maintain these species-rich landscapes in the longer term.

AB  - National agri-environment schemes (AESs) aim to promote sustainable farming and protect farmland biodiversity. For efficient maintenance of biodiversity, it is essential to understand the habitat requirements of fauna, and its responses to farming practices. This study examined the importance of different habitat characteristics and habitat heterogeneity for farmland birds in boreal agricultural landscapes, focusing on species in open arable habitats (true field species) and bushy field-edge habitats. Density, species richness, and species composition were studied in a multivariate space, and along environmental gradients. The relevance of the biodiversity-related measures of the Finnish AES regarding the habitat needs of farmland birds was examined. Non-cropped habitat heterogeneity (especially open ditches and habitat patch richness) increased the density and species richness. Crop diversity increased the species richness of true field species. Ordinations revealed a gradient from large open arable to small field areas, and a relation to habitat heterogeneity. The AES places insufficient emphasis on biodiversity issues.

AB  - IntroductionIndustrialization has ushered in massive changes in agriculture. Particularly in low mountain ranges, large-scale afforestation with Norway spruce on traditionally managed, semi-natural grasslands has caused a severe decline in biodiversity. Tree removal, hay transfer and resumption of grazing or mowing are typical measures to re-create species-rich grasslands. The aim of this study was to use vascular plants and three insect taxa (leafhoppers, true bugs, and grasshoppers) as bioindicators to evaluate the success of montane grassland restoration on former spruce forests in Central Europe. In addition, we intended to identify the drivers of species richness within the studied grasslands in order to derive suitable recommendations for habitat management. MethodsWe analyzed two different treatments: (i) grazed restoration sites where trees had been cut and species-rich green hay had been applied (N = 9) and (ii) target sites with a long continuity of low-intensity grazing (N = 9). Results and DiscussionOur study revealed that all studied taxa responded rapidly to the restoration measures. After a development period of 3 to 5 years, we found no differences in species richness and diversity of leafhoppers, true bugs and grasshoppers (all, target and threatened species). In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a large overlap in species composition between restoration and target grasslands. Among target and threatened species, vascular plants displayed the same pattern as insects and reached similar values when comparing the two treatments. However, total species richness and diversity of vascular plants were still higher on the target sites and species composition overlapped only partially. Grazing intensity was the predictor with the highest explanatory power in multivariable (Generalized) Linear Mixed-effects Models, being negatively related to species richness of leafhoppers and true bugs. We conclude that the measures implemented were effective in re-establishing target communities of different taxa. The transfer of seed-containing hay enabled or accelerated the development of the vegetation. Insects, on the other hand, were able to recolonize the restored grasslands on their own, given that these sites were embedded in a network of species-rich grasslands. With regard to insects (e.g., leafhoppers and true bugs), it should be ensured that grazing is applied at low intensity.

AB  - ContextThe current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union includes three greening measures, which are partly intended to benefit farmland biodiversity. However, the relative biodiversity effects of the greening measures, including joint effects of landscape context, are not well understood.ObjectivesWe studied the effects of increasing crop diversity, proportions of production grasslands and fallows, corresponding to CAP greening measures, on open farmland bird diversity, whilst controlling for the effects of distance to forests, field edge density and proportion of built-up areas.MethodsWe surveyed open farmland birds using territory mapping in Southern Finland. We modelled effects of greening measures and landscape structure on farmland birds (7642 territories) using generalised linear mixed models.ResultsIncreasing proportions of grasslands increased farmland bird species richness and diversity in open farmland, whereas increasing proportions of fallows increased bird diversity. Increasing crop diversity benefited individual species, but not species richness or diversity. Increasing field edge densities consistently increased the species richness of all farmland species, in-field nesters and non-crop nesters, as well as total farmland bird diversity. The relative effect of edge density was much stronger compared to the three greening measures.ConclusionsOur results show that promoting fallows and grasslands, in particular grazed grasslands and various types of semi-natural grasslands, has the highest potential to benefit farmland bird diversity. Maintaining or increasing field edge densities, currently not supported, seems to be of even more benefit. In open farmland, with little or no field edges, fallows and grasslands are particularly beneficial.

AB  - The role of increased timber harvests in reaching climate mitigation targets for European countries will be limited if the protection of forest ecosystem services and biodiversity is to be achieved, suggests an empirical forest model driven by future scenarios to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C in 2100.
   The European Union (EU) set clear climate change mitigation targets to reach climate neutrality, accounting for forests and their woody biomass resources. We investigated the consequences of increased harvest demands resulting from EU climate targets. We analysed the impacts on national policy objectives for forest ecosystem services and biodiversity through empirical forest simulation and multi-objective optimization methods. We show that key European timber-producing countries - Finland, Sweden, Germany (Bavaria) - cannot fulfil the increased harvest demands linked to the ambitious 1.5 degrees C target. Potentials for harvest increase only exists in the studied region Norway. However, focusing on EU climate targets conflicts with several national policies and causes adverse effects on multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that the role of forests and their timber resources in achieving climate targets and societal decarbonization should not be overstated. Our study provides insight for other European countries challenged by conflicting policies and supports policymakers.

AB  - Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is one of the most important fodder crops worldwide. The knowledge of genetic diversity among red clover populations, however, is under development. This study provides insights into its genetic diversity, using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to define population structure in wild and cultivated red clover. Twenty-nine accessions representing the genetic resources available at NordGen (the Nordic gene bank) and Lantmannen (a Swedish agricultural company with a red clover breeding program) were used for this study. Genotyping was performed via SeqSNP, a targeted genotype by sequencing method that offers the capability to target specific SNP loci and enables de novo discovery of new SNPs. The SNPs were identified through a SNP mining approach based on coding sequences of red clover genes known for their involvement in development and stress responses. After filtering the genotypic data using various criteria, 623 bi-allelic SNPs, including 327 originally targeted and 296 de novo discovered SNPs were used for population genetics analyses. Seventy-one of the SNP loci were under selection considering both Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and pairwise F-ST distributions. The average observed heterozygosity (H-O), within population diversity (H-S) and overall diversity (H-T) were 0.22, 0.21 and 0.22, respectively. The tetraploids had higher average H-O (0.35) than diploids (0.21). The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed low but significant variation among accessions (5.4%; P < 0.001), and among diploids and tetraploids (1.08%; P = 0.02). This study revealed a low mean inbreeding coefficient (F-IS = -0.04) exhibiting the strict outcrossing nature of red clover. As per cluster, principal coordinate and discriminant analyses, most wild populations were grouped together and were clearly differentiated from the cultivated types. The cultivated types of red clover had a similar level of genetic diversity, suggesting that modern red clover breeding programs did not negatively affect genetic diversity or population structure. Hence, the breeding material used by Lantmannen represents the major genetic resources in Scandinavia. This knowledge of how different types of red clover accessions relate to each other and the level of outcrossing and heterozygosity will be useful for future red clover breeding.

AB  - As France works out its plan to tackle climate change issues, questions are arising in the forest sector as to how sectoral mitigation programs such as those designed to enhance fuelwood consumption or to stimulate in-forest carbon sequestration may coincide with an inter-sectoral program such as an economy-wide carbon tax. This paper provides insights into this question by exploring the impacts of (1) a combination of a carbon tax and a fuelwood policy, and (2) a combination of a carbon tax and a sequestration policy on (i) the economy of the forest sector, and (ii) the dynamics of the forest resource. To do this, we used a modified version of the French Forest Sector Model (FFSM) and carried out simulations on a 2020 time horizon. Basing our analysis on the fuelwood sector, we showed that wood producers always benefit from the combination of a carbon tax with either a fuelwood policy or a sequestration policy at the national level. Conversely, and although it favors wood products instead of non-wood substitutes, a carbon tax always decreases consumer surpluses by increasing wood product prices. As a consequence, the combination of a carbon tax with sectoral policies is likely to raise questions about the political economy of the mitigation program. This is particularly true in the case of a combination of a carbon tax with a sequestration policy, which already decreases consumer surpluses. We eventually showed that by increasing transport costs between domestic regions, the carbon tax reallocates production patterns over French territory which could lead to the necessity of a regional breakdown of policy-mixes in the forest sector.

AB  - The interaction between policy making and industry is a key to understanding he conditions for 'reening' contemporary energy systems. This article uses efforts toward greening the Mongstad oil refinery in Norway as a case to analyse the challenges involved in politically stimulated shifts towards increased sustainability in the energy sector. A technology test centre and a full-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at Mongstad were the centrepiece of the Stoltenberg government's (2005-2013) climate strategy. However, the project suffered delays and cost overruns until the full-scale carbon capture and storage project was eventually stopped. It is argued that interactions between the policy-making and industrial innovation arenas involved in this case are challenging because they operate according to different internal logics. We conceptualize this divergence as 'policy/industry dissonance' and suggest that this concept is a useful complement to literatures on regional innovation systems (RIS) and the multilevel perspective on sustainability transitions (MLP).

AB  - We studied the genetic diversity, gene flow and population structure among 18 populations of the clonal bryophyte Trichocolea tomentella located in Finland, Lithuania, the UK and Canada using DNA fingerprinting methods. T. tomentella is a habitat-limited, unisexual hepatic, which occupies spring and mesic habitats in woodland. The relatively small populations are increasingly fragmented with a high risk for extinction for extrinsic reasons. The presence of relatively high levels of genetic diversity regardless of population size highlights the role of even small remnant populations as important sources of genetic diversity in T tomentella. The long-term accumulation of genotypes and somatic mutations may explain the observed levels of diversity. Gene flow among populations seems to be infrequent indicating dispersal limitation also on the relatively small spatial scale. Colonization within populations is not affected by isolation by distance suggesting the occurrence of random short-range dispersal of detached vegetative fragments. The population structure study confirmed the low mortality rates of shoots indicating a long life span of the clones in favourable conditions. Efficient ramet production by branching is likely to operate against interspecific competition. To conclude, T tomentella appears to persist well in undisturbed habitats due to clonal regeneration, although restricted dispersal capacity is likely to prevent successful (re-)colonization in the potential habitat patches of recovering forest landscapes. The implications of the results for conservation are introduced. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: This research investigates moth biodiversity in two southern Swedish provinces, Vastergotland and Smaland, spanning from 1974 to 2019. The moth diversity over these years was evaluated using data collected from literary sources. To augment this dataset, a light trap was installed in each province in 2020. The data demonstrate enhanced diversity in Kalmar, Smaland, and a more rapid colonisation rate throughout the study period in Smaland compared to Vastergotland. Noteworthily, our traps in Vastergotland and Smaland captured 44% and 28% of the known moth species in these provinces, respectively. We reveal significant associations between the probability of species presence in the traps and specific traits when contrasted with a provincial species pool. Traits disproportionately represented in the traps encompass species with considerable variation in colour patterns, generalist habitat and host plant preferences, extended flight periods, and species that primarily overwinter as eggs. This research underscores the influences of climate change and human activities on the shaping of moth biodiversity.
   As moths are vital components of ecosystems and serve as important bioindicators, understanding the dynamics of their communities and the factors influencing these dynamics, such as anthropogenic impacts, is crucial to understand the ecological processes. Our study focuses on two provinces in southern Sweden, Vastergotland and Smaland, where we used province records from 1974 to 2019 in combination with light traps (in 2020) to record the presence and abundance of moth species, subsequently assessing species traits to determine potential associations with their presence in anthropogenically modified landscapes. This study design provides a unique opportunity to assess temporal changes in moth communities and their responses to shifts in environmental conditions, including anthropogenic impacts. Across the Vastergotland and Smaland provinces in Sweden, we recorded 776 moth taxa belonging to fourteen different taxonomic families of mainly Macroheterocera. We captured 44% and 28% of the total moth species known from these provinces in our traps in Boras (Vastergotland) and Kalmar (Smaland), respectively. In 2020, the species richness and abundance were higher in Boras than in Kalmar, while the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices revealed a higher species diversity in Kalmar. Between 1974 and 2019, the colonisation rates of the provinces increased faster in Smaland. Ninety-three species were found to have colonised these provinces since 1974, showing that species richness increased over the study period. We reveal significant associations between the probability of a species being present in the traps and distinct traits compared to a provincial species pool. Traits over-represented in the traps included species with a high variation in colour patterns, generalist habitat preferences, extended flight periods, lower host plant specificity, and overwintering primarily as eggs. Our findings underscore the ongoing ecological filtering that favours certain species-specific traits. This study sheds light on the roles of climate change and anthropogenic impacts in shaping moth biodiversity, offers key insights into the ecological processes involved, and can guide future conservation efforts.

AB  - Correct species identification is fundamental for assessment and understanding of biodiversity. Erroneous species identification may impede conservation management and may delay detection of invasive species. The ubiqui-tous green algal genus Ulva is known for its wide environmental tolerance, plastic morphology, occurrence of cryptic species and ambiguous species concepts that hinder clear identification. We used molecular monitoring to assess species diversity and distribution of Ulva along the full Atlantic-Baltic Sea salinity gradient (> 10,000 km). Ulva specimens were collected from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. DNA barcoding analysis of the tufA gene revealed 20 genetic entities in total, of which 11 could be identified to species level (U. californica, U. flexuosa, U. torta, U. linza, U. prolifera, U. fenestrata, U. australis, U. intestinalis, U. compressa, U. gigantea, U. lacinulata). Nine entities (Ulva sp. 1-9; [Ulva capillata]) yielded novel sequence reads that belonged to either unidentified species, species complexes, or singletons. At least 3 of the discovered species (U. australis, U. californica, U. gigantea) are considered non-native and potentially invasive. Furthermore, considerable differences between the observed and the historically estimated species distributions were found. The highest diversity was recorded in the Atlantic and Skagerrak region whereas only two entities of taxo-nomically accepted species where found north-east the Blekinge coast. Our study shows that the species diversity of Ulva in the study area is diverging from previous reports, and that molecular methods are imperative for species identification in this morphologically plastic genus. Furthermore, the presence of non-native species indicates a necessity for further fine-scale monitoring in specific areas to e.g. mitigate formation of green tides.

AB  - To develop viable strategies for intensifying the use of forest biomass and for increasing forest protection, impacts on ecosystem services need to be assessed. We investigated the biophysical and economic impacts of increased forest biomass production and biodiversity protection on forest ecosystem services.
   The European Forest Information SCENario (EFISCEN) model was applied for 26 European countries. Three different scenarios were considered: a reference scenario (no policy changes, a moderate increase in roundwoocl, residue and stump biomass production), a wood energy scenario (enhanced roundwood, residue and stump biomass production to achieve national renewable energy targets), and a biodiversity scenario (setting aside 5% of the forest area with restrictions on wood production combined with biodiversity-friendly management on the remaining area). The impacts were assessed by analyzing impacts on provisioning (roundwood production and residue and stump biomass production) and other services (carbon storage, deadwood and recreation) for the period 2010-2030.
   We found that roundwood, residue and stump biomass production could be intensified, but there are trade-offs with non marketed ecosystem services. Increasing biomass production could lead to a net societal benefit in 2030. However, larger benefits would be obtained within Europe if forest biodiversity protection is enhanced.

AB  - Mixed uneven-aged forests are considered favorable to the provision of multiple ecosystem services and to the conciliation of timber production and biodiversity conservation. However, some forest managers now plan to increase the intensity of thinning and harvesting operations in these forests. Retention measures or gap creation are considered to compensate potential negative impacts on biodiversity. Our objectives were to assess the effect of these management practices on timber production and biodiversity conservation and identify potential compensating effects between these practices, using the concept of ecological intensification as a framework. We performed a simulation study coupling Samsara2, a simulation model designed for spruce-fir uneven-aged mountain forests, an uneven-aged silviculture algorithm, and biodiversity models. We analyzed the effect of parameters related to uneven-aged management practices on timber production, biodiversity, and sustainability indicators. Our study confirmed that the indicators responded differently to management practices, leading to trade-offs situations. Increasing management intensity had negative impacts on several biodiversity indicators, which could be partly compensated by the positive effect of retention measures targeting large trees, non-dominant species, and deadwood. The impact of gap creation was more mitigated, with a positive effect on the diversity of tree sizes and deadwood but a negative impact on the spruce-fir mixing balance and on the diversity of the understory layer. Through the analysis of compensating effects, we finally revealed the existence of possible ecological intensification pathways, i.e., the possibility to increase management intensity while maintaining biodiversity through the promotion of nature-based management principles (gap creation and retention measures).

AB  - Global change has fueled debates on forest use and management, including the need to adapt management to mitigate future risks in forestry. Additionally, forests are important for biodiversity conservation and could be used in climate change mitigation. The opinions of stakeholders towards acceptable forest use deserve consideration. This study examined relations between environmental problem awareness, forest beliefs and environmental management attitudes (biodiversity conservation and carbon substitution) among stakeholders in Sweden, and explored the effect of a local biodiversity versus global climate change frame on attitudes. Stakeholders were recruited from ownership and environmental/recreational interest groups (owner and nature group, respectively) (membership sample) and among students (student sample). Whereas the owner group was more positive towards carbon substitution in forestry, the nature group was more positive towards biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. In the membership sample, awareness of biodiversity loss and eco-social forest beliefs influenced attitudes towards biodiversity conservation. In contrast, positive attitudes towards carbon substitution stemmed from lower awareness of biodiversity loss, less emphasis on openness towards new methods in forestry and greater emphasis on production in forestry. While framing did not influence attitudes, the cognitive hierarchy was useful in providing a nuanced understanding of stakeholders, valuable for policy and practice.

AB  - The spatial structure and underlying assembly mechanisms of bacterial communities have been studied widely across aquatic systems, focusing primarily on isolated sites, such as different lakes, ponds and streams. Here, our main aim was to determine the underlying mechanisms for bacterial biofilm assembly within a large, highly connected lake system in Northern Finland using associative methods based on taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-and beta-diversity and a large number of abiotic and biotic variables. Furthermore, null model approaches were used to quantify the relative importance of different community assembly processes. We found that spatial variation in bacterial communities within the lake was structured by different assembly processes, including stochasticity, species sorting and potentially even dispersal limitation. Species sorting by abiotic environmental conditions explained more of the taxonomic and particularly phylogenetic turnover in community composition compared with that by biotic variables. Finally, we observed clear differences in alpha diversity (species richness and phylogenetic diversity), which were to a stronger extent determined by abiotic compared with biotic factors, but also by dispersal effects. In summary, our study shows that the biodiversity of bacterial biofilm communities within a lake ecosystem is driven by within-habitat gradients in abiotic conditions and by stochastic and deterministic dispersal processes.

AB  - Small arable fields are beneficial with regard to ecosystem services, e.g., concerning biodiversity. By selecting appropriate crops and cultivation practices, arable fields can also be used as carbon sinks. The objectives of this study were to investigate what impact field conditions (e.g., field size and shape) and payments (subsidies) for environmental benefits have on profitability. A dynamic simulation model was used to simulate machine operations in fields of two different shapes and five different sizes (from 0.75 to 12.00 ha). A wide range of crops cultivated in Sweden were investigated (fallow land and plantation of Norway spruce were also included). A perimeter-based subsidy was suggested in order to conserve and promote biodiversity, and an area- and crop-based subsidy was suggested in order to promote sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC). The results showed that, without financial support and from a purely economic point of view, most field types investigated should be planted with Norway spruce. With currently available subsidies, e.g., EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payments, hybrid aspen, poplar, fallow, and extensive ley cultivation are the most profitable crops. Perimeter-based subsidies favoured the net gain for small fields. As expected, a subsidy for sequestration of SOC favoured cultivation of specific SOC-sequestering crops such as ley, willow, and poplar. Our recommendation for future studies is to investigate a well-balanced combination of perimeter-based support and SOC sequestration support that benefits biodiversity and climate under different cultivation conditions.

AB  - Patterns of species diversity and community structure depend on scales larger than just a single habitat and might be influenced by the surrounding landscape. We studied the response of two insect families, mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and dytiscids (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), to landscape variables at five spatial scales. We studied adult mosquito and dytiscid abundance, diversity, and species assemblages in relation to water permanence (area of permanent water bodies versus temporary wetlands) and forest cover (area covered by forest versus open land) within nested circles of 100 to 3000 m around trap sites in four wetlands in southern Sweden and in five wetlands in central Sweden. We found that mosquito abundance was greatest in areas with plentiful forest cover and a high proportion of temporary water, while most dytiscids favored open areas with a high proportion of permanent wetlands. However, diversity of both mosquitoes and dytiscids was positively correlated with high permanence and little forest cover. Mosquito species assemblages were mainly influenced by forest cover at a large spatial scale, whereas permanence was more important at local scales. Dytiscid species assemblages were mainly influenced by water permanence, especially at intermediate spatial scales. These results can be explained by the flight capability and dispersal behavior of mosquito and dytiscid species. The observed landscape associations of mosquitoes and dytiscids could be useful when creating new wetlands. Mosquito colonization could be reduced by creating permanent wetlands in an open landscape, which would favor colonization by dytiscids, a potential predator of mosquito larvae, while also supporting the diversity of both taxa.

AB  - The necessity to move from a traditional fishery management to an ecosystem approach is now acknowledged. Indicators are required to support the development of this approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed to assess the impact of fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates-typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs-of "Grande Vasiere", a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort. Species diversity was lower in the most exploited area. The highly trawled area was dominated by opportunistic organisms, mainly one species of swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator, one species of squat lobster Munida rugosa and Norway lobsters Nephrops norvegicus, which are large-bodied species. Consequently, the results of the ABC method were inconsistent with the theoretical expectation for these particular macrofaunal communities and the measured levels of fishing intensity.

While disease prevention and control measures are becoming increasingly critical, there is a dearth of studies on the epidemiological aspects of disease transmission in aquatic ecosystems. This study aims to forecast the spread of a bacterial disease between fish farms in two regions, Romsdalsfjord in Norway and Gujwa in South Korea by applying a DTU-DADS-Aqua spatiotemporal hybrid simulation model. The simulation model assessed the pattern of disease transmission between fish farms under different degrees of transmission power based on the distance between farms (ScalingInf), host susceptibility (RelSusceptibility), the origin site of disease, and the capacity of culling fish. The distance between fish farms was found to have significant associations with disease transmission. In most simulation conditions, the disease transmission between different bay management areas (BMAs) was not evident in Romsdalsfjord. In the Guwja region, where there are relatively narrow distances between fish farms, the spread of infectious disease was greatly affected by ScalingInf. The impact of RelSusceptibility on disease transmission patterns is a critical factor to consider in simulation modeling. When RelSusceptibility ranges from 0.5-1, there is little impact on the likelihood of disease transmission. Conversely, lower ranges (0.2 and 0.05) of RelSusceptibility result in a significant decrease in the area affected by the spread of disease. Eradication measures could control the patterns of infectious disease transmission, but the effectiveness of the depopulation strategy can be dramatically changed depending on the geographical environment. In conclusion, through a comparative analysis of the disease transmission and management scenarios, this study demonstrates the potential use of existing simulation models in predicting the spread of infectious diseases under different epidemiological circumstances and quarantine actions.

AB  - Landrace accessions have long been recognized as an important source of genetic diversity for crop species, and landraces are stored in genebanks across the world as genetic resources for future crop development. Landraces are also an important part of the human cultural heritage and as such they have been used for genetic studies to make inferences about historical agriculture. However, surprisingly little is known about the within-accession diversity of landrace crops of different species. In order to evaluate the diversity of Swedish landraces we used microsatellite markers to genotype accessions of four species (barley, pea, oats and rye), both extant genebank material and 114-year-old seed samples of similar geographic origin and type. We found consistently high levels of within-population genetic diversity in the historical material, but varying and often lower diversity levels in the genebank accessions. We also make tentative conclusions about how representative the genebank material is to what was originally cultivated in its reported area of origin and suggest that the true identity of the genebank accessions is unclear and that historical seed collections should be a more appropriate material for the study of historical agriculture.

AB  - Melampyrum sylvaticum is an endangered annual hemiparasitic plant that is found in only 19 small and isolated populations in the United Kingdom (UK). To evaluate the genetic consequences of this patchy distribution we compared levels of diversity, inbreeding and differentiation from ten populations from the UK with eight relatively large populations from Sweden and Norway where the species is more continuously distributed. We demonstrate that in both the UK and Scandinavia, the species is highly inbreeding (global F (IS) = 0.899). Levels of population differentiation were high (F'(ST) = 0.892) and significantly higher amongst UK populations (F'(ST) = 0.949) than Scandinavian populations (F'(ST) = 0.762; P < 0.01). The isolated populations in the UK have, on average, lower genetic diversity (allelic richness, proportion of loci that are polymorphic, gene diversity) than Scandinavian populations, and this diversity difference is associated with the smaller census size and population area of UK populations. From a conservation perspective, the naturally inbreeding nature of the species may buffer the species against immediate effects of inbreeding depression, but the markedly lower levels of genetic diversity in UK populations may represent a genetic constraint to evolutionary change. In addition, the high levels of population differentiation suggest that gene flow among populations will not be effective at replenishing lost variation. We thus recommend supporting in situ conservation management with ex situ populations and human-mediated seed dispersal among selected populations in the UK.

AB  - 1. The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has rapidly entered policy and planning agendas nationally and globally. However, its usefulness is hampered by, for example, insufficient understanding of underlying ecological processes and poorly developed and competing conceptual frameworks. 2. It is suggested that final ecosystem services, such as yield, can be partitioned into components describing contributions from ecosystems (regulating and maintenance ES as natural inputs) and human inputs. This conceptual framework is tested by examining the relative importance of farming system (conventional vs. organic, indicating human inputs, and management), landscape (field shape and landscape heterogeneity), and biological control of aphids by natural enemies (indicating a regulating ES) for barley yield on 10 fields in central Sweden. 3. Although biological control was related to increased yield, its contribution was relatively small (<20%). The farming system explained most of the magnitude and variation in yield (47% of the variation, of which 34% was unique). Landscape and biological control had the largest shared contribution to variation in yield (14%). Conventional farming management seemed to have a larger effect on yield than biological control. This could be interpreted as indicating that agricultural production should be further intensified to increase yields, but a high dependency on external inputs may cause further environmental problems, such as eutrophication, and may not be sustainable. 4. Although preliminary, the results suggest that partitioning of natural and human inputs is useful to analyse the contribution of regulating ES to final ecosystem services, and how ES are co-produced by ecosystems and humans.

Studies in coastal marine benthic habitats are sparse, and predominantly target single higher taxonomic groups. Here we describe macrobenthic marine invertebrate community surveys from 52 localities in Onslow Bay ( Beaufort, North Carolina, U.S.A.), over an extensive geographic area (similar to 200 km(2)). The data consist of 11,467 individuals, 175 species, and 7 phyla. The data include species abundance data for each sample at all localities, and corresponding species lists and locality information. The metadata describe the sampling protocols and localities. The data provided here will facilitate examination of assemblage heterogeneity with regards to spatial and temporal patterns, and depth gradient analyses.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services are crucial for human well-being and the livability of cities. A central challenge for sustaining ecosystem services lies in addressing scale mismatches between ecological processes on one hand, and social processes of governance on the other. This article synthesizes a set of case studies from urban green areas in Stockholm, Sweden-allotment gardens, urban parks, cemeteries and protected areas-and discusses how governmental agencies and civil society groups engaged in urban green area management can be linked through social networks so as to better match spatial scales of ecosystem processes. The article develops a framework that combines ecological scales with social network structure, with the latter being taken as the patterns of interaction between actor groups. Based on this framework, the article (1) assesses current ecosystem governance, and (2) develops a theoretical understanding of how social network structure influences ecosystem governance and how certain actors can work as agents to promote beneficial network structures. The main results show that the mesoscale of what is conceptualized as city scale green networks (i.e., functionally interconnected local green areas) is not addressed by any actor in Stockholm, and that the management practices of civil society groups engaged in local ecosystem management play a crucial but neglected role in upholding ecosystem services. The article proposes an alternative network structure and discusses the role of midscale managers (for improving ecological functioning) and scale-crossing brokers (engaged in practices to connect actors across ecological scales). Dilemmas, strategies, and practices for establishing this governance system are discussed.

AB  - Intensive forest harvesting has increased in Fennoscandia over the last few decades. Similar developments may follow throughout Europe as renewable energy replaces fossil fuels. The international literature suggests that intensive harvesting could increase ecological risks to yield, carbon stores, soil fertility, and biodiversity, but geographically specific knowledge is sparse in many countries, and results do not extend beyond 5-30 years after harvesting. We use Denmark as a case for discussing future directions. Forest history is described, and research on ecological effects and their inclusion in governance is reviewed. Denmark was almost completely deforested by the early 1800s, but centuries of afforestation have resulted in a current forest cover of 14.3%. Research commonly uses stem-only harvesting as a reference against which to compare intensive harvesting impacts, but pristine forests would be a more useful reference for ecological processes and biodiversity. However, pristine forests are almost non-existent in Europe, and non-intervention, self-regulating forests provide an alternative. Governance and positions of non-governmental organizations in Denmark focus more on general forest management impacts and conservation of light-demanding biodiversity associated with historic coppicing and grazing than on intensive harvesting. The energy sector drives the development of new governance to verify forest biomass sustainability, but the national knowledge base for such verification is limited. As part of a larger solution, we suggest establishing a network of non-intervention, self-regulating forests that can serve as a reference for long-term research and monitoring of intensive harvesting impacts. This would support the application of adaptive management strategies, and continuous improvements of best management practice guidelines.

AB  - River corridors play an important role in the carbon cycle as sites of carbon transport, storage, and transformation. Floodplain soil organic carbon (OC) and dead, downed large wood (LW) are two of the largest OC stocks in rivers. Human modifications of river corridors, such as damming and floodplain land-use change, have likely modified floodplain OC storage and retention through removal of LW and potential reduction of OC concentrations in soils. However, the effect of human alterations on floodplain OC storage is poorly understood. We measured floodplain soil OC and downed LW loads on three rivers in northern Sweden that display a gradient in the degree of human alteration. The Muddus River is located in a national park and is unaltered. The Vindel River is free-flowing but has been modified via logging and other land-use changes within the floodplain. The Ume River is dammed along its length and has also experienced floodplain logging and land-use change. We used statistical models to determine which factors are associated with differences in mineral soil OC and LW among rivers with different degrees of human alteration. We find the highest mineral soil OC concentrations on the unaltered Muddus River (mean +/- standard error (SE) = 3.70 +/- 0.59%; median = 3.81%), with lower soil OC along the Vindel (mean +/- SE = 1.44 +/- 0.22%; median = 0.72%) and Ume (mean +/- SE = 2.47 +/- 0.44%; median = 1.12%) Rivers. The Muddus River also has the highest downed LW loads (mean +/- SE = 22.25 +/- 6.99 m(3) ha(-1)) compared to the Vindel (mean +/- SE = 3.10 +/- 1.26 m(3) ha(-1)) and Ume (mean +/- SE = 7.26 +/- 3.53 m(3) ha(-1)) Rivers. Variations in soil OC and downed large wood loads indicate that damming may reduce floodplain OC in these boreal systems through reducing lateral channel-floodplain connectivity and longitudinal connectivity. Logging and other land-use changes likely reduce OC inputs to the floodplain surface through removal of organic matter and LW. Further research is needed to elucidate the impact of human modifications on floodplain OC across diverse regions and to inform river restoration efforts to enhance floodplain OC storage.

AB  - The ecological niche, in terms of habitat and diet, is described for two whitefish stocks in Norway, the monomorphic Mjosa whitefish and the polymorphic Femund whitefish. The Mjosa whitefish exhibited two ontogenetic habitat changes. Fish 7-25 cm in length lived in the shallow epibenthic zone; fish in the 25-35 cm group lived epibenthically down to at least 90 m, as well as in the pelagic zone in late summer and autumn; whereas fish larger than 35 cm lived in deep epibenthic waters. The three whitefish morphs in Femund differed in habitat use and to some degree in diet. However, there was a substantial niche overlap among them, as the most generalised morph, D-whitefish, had a wide niche which largely encompassed the niche of the two other morphs: The occurrence of polymorphism is briefly discussed in view of the apparently low degree of segregation among the sympatric morphs.

AB  - Human disturbance in alpine habitats is expected to increase, and improved knowledge of short-term recovery after disturbance events is necessary to interpret vegetation responses and formulate planning and mitigation efforts. The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state.

AB  - Conflicts between changing landscapes and static nature protection concepts were addressed as an example of the agricultural landscape of SW Norway. We aimed to deduce indicators for spatio-temporal landscape changes to draw scenarios for future protection perspectives of a RAMSAR and nature reserve. To estimate the variability of bird diversity, changes in vegetation patterns were analysed to predict bird occurrence. We obtained a differentiated analysis of present landscape dynamics by measuring landscape structure, vegetation, hydrology and nutrient concentration. Multivariate statistics were used to extract the main driving forces for changes in vegetation patterns out of a complex landscape ecological data set. Subsequently, we compared the measured data with those of past landscape stages to determine landscape changes and their mechanisms at different spatio-temporal scales. Ecological process indicators (EPI) were derived, and three different indicator constellations were used for scenario descriptions. These scenarios were chosen as to the current assumptions of typical contrasting nature protection strategies. Concluding, we used EPIs to evaluate nature protection aims and to assess scenarios of changing landscapes. This approach will be transferable to other examples of nature protection conflicts in the agricultural landscape in general. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural disturbances are increasing around the globe, also impacting protected areas. Although previous studies have indicated that natural disturbances result in mainly positive effects on biodiversity, these analyses mostly focused on a few well established taxonomic groups, and thus uncertainty remains regarding the comprehensive impact of natural disturbances on biodiversity. Using Malaise traps and meta-barcoding, we studied a broad range of arthropod taxa, including dark and cryptic taxa, along a gradient of bark beetle disturbance severities in five European national parks. We identified order-level community thresholds of disturbance severity and classified barcode index numbers (BINs; a cluster system for DNA sequences, where each cluster corresponds to a species) as negative or positive disturbance indicators. Negative indicator BINs decreased above thresholds of low to medium disturbance severity (20%-30% of trees killed), whereas positive indicator BINs benefited from high disturbance severity (76%-98%). BINs allocated to a species name contained nearly as many positive as negative disturbance indicators, but dark and cryptic taxa, particularly Diptera and Hymenoptera in our data, contained higher numbers of negative disturbance indicator BINs. Analyses of changes in the richness of BINs showed variable responses of arthropods to disturbance severity at lower taxonomic levels, whereas no significant signal was detected at the order level due to the compensatory responses of the underlying taxa. We conclude that the analyses of dark taxa can offer new insights into biodiversity responses to disturbances. Our results suggest considerable potential for forest management to foster arthropod diversity, for example by maintaining both closed-canopy forests (>70% cover) and open forests (<30% cover) on the landscape.

AB  - The likely environmental changes throughout the next century have the potential to strongly alter forest disturbance regimes which may heavily affect forest functions as well as forest management. Forest stands already poorly adapted to current environmental conditions, such as secondary Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests outside their natural range, are expected to be particularly prone to such risks. By means of a simulation study, a secondary Norway spruce forest management unit in Austria was studied under conditions of climatic change with regard to effects of bark beetle disturbance on timber production and carbon sequestration over a time period of 100 years. The modified patch model PICUS v1.41. including a submodule of bark beetle-induced tree mortality, was employed to assess four alternative management strategies: (a) Norway spruce age-class forestry, (b) Norway spruce continuous cover forestry, (c) conversion to mixed species stands, and (d) no management. Two sets of simulations were investigated, one without the consideration of biotic disturbances, the other including possible bark beetle damages. Simulations were conducted for a de-trended baseline climate (1961-1990) as well as for two transient climate change scenarios featuring a distinct increase in temperature. The main objectives were to: (i) estimate the effects of bark beetle damage on timber production and carbon (C) sequestration under climate change; (ii) assess the effects of disregarding bark beetle disturbance in the analysis.
   Results indicated a strong increase in bark beetle damage under climate change scenarios (up to +219% in terms of timber volume losses) compared to the baseline climate scenario. Furthermore, distinct differences were revealed between the studied management strategies, pointing at considerably lower amounts of salvage in the conversion strategy. In terms of C storage, increased biotic disturbances under climate change reduced C storage in the actively managed strategies (up to -41.0 tC ha(-1)) over the 100-year simulation period, whereas in the unmanaged control variant some scenarios even resulted in increased C sequestration due to a stand density effect.
   Comparing the simulation series with and without bark beetle disturbances the main findings were: (i) forest C storage was higher in all actively managed strategies under climate change, when biotic disturbances were disregarded (up to +31.6 tC ha(-1) over 100 years); and (ii) in the undisturbed, unmanaged variant C sequestration was lower compared to the simulations with bark beetle disturbance (up to -69.9 tC ha(-1) over 100 years). The study highlights the importance of including the full range of ecosystem-specific disturbances by isolating the effect of one important agent on timber production and C sequestration.

AB  - In this paper, an attempt is made to determine an intangible capitalization premium based on an expected further value increment of forest stands. Such premium cannot be determined through exponential interpolation. Firstly, any discount rate depending on maturity proposes clearcuttings soon after thinning as a computational artifact. Secondly, exponential interpolation with a constant discount rate violates an internal consistency criterion as the rotation age increases. Omitting the intangible capitalization premium, the carbon stock of boreal forest can be increased in a variety of ways (albeit at the expense of a capital return rate deficiency). A small excess volume can be economically gained by increasing sapling density. Greater excess volume is best achieved by restricting thinnings. A large excess volume is best achieved by omitting thinnings. Regardless of the technique used, enhanced carbon storage requires financial compensation in terms of a carbon rent. With the present European emission prices, there is no financial difficulty in establishing such a carbon rent arrangement.

AB  - Knowledge of genetic diversity among wild populations is becoming increasingly important as more species are recognized for their bioeconomic value. Industrialization of natural resources, such as kelp in the marine shallow sublittoral zone through cultivation and wild-harvesting, may lead to extensive translocation and local population decimation. Without adequate resilience in the form of genetic diversity within and across populations and given the potential introduction of deleterious alleles from translocations, such anthropogenically pressured populations may not be able to sufficiently respond to future climate and other stressors. Here we provide an assessment of the genetic heterogeneity of two bioeconomically important kelp species, Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, across the Norwegian coastal region from South (57 degrees N) to North (78 degrees N), by applying microsatellite genotyping. Isolation by distance was found for both kelp species when comparing genetic distance to geographic distance. L. hyperborea clustered into four distinct genetic groups corresponding to distinct geographical ecoregions, whereas S. latissima did not show equally strong geographical structuring but separated into three geographical clusters along the Norwegian coast. No genetic differentiation was found within the Norwegian Skagerrak region, corroborating previous findings. The identified genetic clustering of both kelp species supports the retention of established management regions along the Norwegian coast and argues for the continuation of a regional focused management plan for kelp resources. Further, the results demonstrate that care should be taken to prevent translocation of kelp between ecoregions in the ongoing industrialization of kelp cultivation, to maintain a healthy coastal ecosystem and sound natural population genetic diversity.

AB  - The review of current studies on the importance of two main natural disturbances in montane and boreal forests of Europe, dominated by Norway spruce, namely windstorms and the spruce bark beetle outbreaks, for the accumulation of decaying wood in forest ecosystems, shows the relationship between these processes and the creation of habitat diversity for epixylic lichens, especially in the context of the conservation of rare and endangered species. At the same time, this work reveals insufficiency of knowledge on this subject and points to the potential negative effects of removing this substrate in forests under area protection. it also includes recommendations for modern forestry, in which one of the significant goals would be to protect biodiversity.

Species diversity and abundance data were obtained from seine hauls in aquatic vegetation biotopes of nymphaeids predominantly Nuphar lutea. Acidity levels decreased steadily from May to August in 1995. In 1996, acidity levels increased during May, July and early August. Acidification levels were related to low abundances of 0(+) juveniles, except for 0(+) juvenile (Esox lucius L.) in the estuary, and lower species richness in the 0(+) fish community in the river in 1996. Single species dominance, expressed as rank abundance curves, tvas typical in the river's 0(+) juvenile fish community during the acidification in 1996.

AB  - Birch forests cover large areas of the northern Fennoscandia and the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) often forming the altitudinal and Arctic forest and tree lines. Interpreting the factors leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors. Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation data of biomass in the period 1957-2006, we were able to assess the transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957-2006. Only lichen biomass has been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The results presented in this paper show significant and positive relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer population in the period 1957-2006 in the study area. The hypothesis concerning the removal of the "lichen barrier effect" by heavy reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also, climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks, freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the period 1955-2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to the reduction of total net emission Of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover, reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes a case where an attempt was made to introduce TEK/IK into a conflict between Sami reindeer owners and environmental institutions. The conflict was brought on by the establishment of a national park in Southern Sami areas in Norway. At first, the Sami were in favour of the park, but later on their attitudes changed as the content of planned national park developed. The reindeer owners discovered that the size of the park would be reduced, leaving out what they thought were significant areas in need of protection. They saw the encouragement of increased tourism activities as a threat to reindeer herding and felt alienated by the number of representatives they received in the park management structures. On the basis of these observations reindeer owners protested, but were ignored. As researchers well-established in the Southern Sami area, we were brought into conversations regarding the park as the local reindeer owners searched for ways of bringing new arguments into the process. At this point we thought TEK/IK represented an opportunity to add weight to Sami perspectives. As the title of this article indicates, as push came to shove we did not succeed in making room for local participation in our TEK/IK project, despite these existing on-going relations. The article attempts to understand what happened. Our analysis is based upon a perception of TEK/IK as not one, but at least two co-constituted knowledge practices. The premise is that research failures are as important to publish as successes. Our joint ethnographic experience has methodological implications for future TEK/IK research.

AB  - Using wood in multistory apartment construction (WMC) has a climate-positive advantage with buildings acting as long-term carbon storage. Business ecosystem (BE) development around WMC is needed to accelerate the adoption of wooden materials in the conservative construction industry. As the business actors around WMC are essentially different from those using other building materials, new knowledge must be built from the project level. This study uses a qualitative interview approach among actors from three pioneering urban building projects to address their perceptions of building with wood regarding a project-based BE. Based on the thematic analysis, sources of both tangible and intangible value creation were found to arise from building with wood. A higher degree of prefabrication associated with WMC was seen in all projects to influence the reorganization of logistics, enabling faster building processes and lean material use. No strong sustainability-driven culture could be identified in any of the projects. Results further flag the sensitivity and importance of management and coordination skills in targeting improvements of the construction business based on WMC. In the bigger picture, there is still room for further research at regional and global level on business model changes in building with this renewable and recyclable material.

TI  - The land management tool: Developing a climate service in Southwest UK
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
LA  - English
AB  - Seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) have significant potential to support shorter-term agricultural decisions and longer-term climate adaptation plans, but uptake in Europe has to date been low. Under the European Union funded project, European Provision Of Regional Impacts Assessments on Seasonal and Decadal Timescales (EUPORIAS) we have developed the Land Management Tool (LMTool), a prototype seasonal climate service for land managers, working closely in collaboration with two stakeholder organizations, Clinton Devon Estates (CDE) and the National Farmers Union (NFU). LMTool was one of several prototype climate services selected for development within EUPORIAS, including those for the UK transport network, food security in Ethiopia, renewable energy production, hydroelectric energy production in Sweden, and river management in two French basins. The LMTool provides SCFs (1-3 months ahead) to farmers in the Southwest UK, alongside 14-day site specific weather forecasts during the winter months when the skill of seasonal forecasts is greatest.
   We describe the processes through which the LMTool was co-designed and developed with the farmers, its technical development and key features; critically examine the lessons learned and their implications for providing future climate services for land managers; and finally assess the feasibility of delivering an operational winter seasonal climate service for UK land managers.
   A number of key learning points from developing the prototype may benefit future work in climate services for the land management and agriculture sector; many of these points are also valid for climate services in other sectors. Prototype development strongly benefitted from; working with intermediaries to identify representative, engaged land managers; an iterative and flexible process of co-design with the farmer group; and from an interdisciplinary project team. Further work is needed to develop a better understanding of the role of forecast skill in land management decision making, the potential benefits of downscaling and how seasonal forecasts can help support land managers decision-making processes. The prototype would require considerable work to implement a robust operational forecast system, and a longer period to demonstrate the value of the services provided. Finally, the potential for such services to be applied more widely in Europe is not well understood and would require further stakeholder engagement and forecast development.

AB  - Severe natural disturbances are common, in many forest ecosystems, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Attempts to minimize their effects through forest management include salvage logging. In the Bohemian Forest, one of Central Europe's largest continuous forests, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have affected stands of Norway Spruce for centuries. Over the past decades, these natural disturbances and their management in the Bavarian Forest National Park and the adjacent Sumava National Park in the central part of the Bohemian Forest have been scientifically studied. Owing to a benign-neglect strategy, both windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have increased stand structural heterogeneity, the amount of dead wood and light availability, which contribute to increased populations of nearly-extinct forest specialists. However, the response of a particular taxonomic group or species strongly depends on its relationship to specific legacies that persist after disturbances. Stand climate but not dead wood appears to greatly influence the diversity of epigeal bryophytes, whereas both factors determine the diversity of epixylic bryophytes. Both;the amount and heterogeneity of dead wood seems , to be more important than stand climate in determining assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi and. lichens. To reduce the population density of bark beetles in the management zones of both national parks, storm-felled spruces are salvage logged, which alters a variety of these legacies and natural successional pathways. Consequently, the numbers of species of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and epixylic lichens are reduced. Natural levels of biodiversity in salvage-logged areas can be preserved by (1) preserving root plates of storm-felled trees with partly retained trunks; (2) avoiding soil disturbance by using cable yarding instead of harvesters; (3) retaining sun-exposed dry branches of storm-felled trees and snags of beetle-killed spruces; (4) avoiding logging damage of natural regeneration and of large trees that survive disturbances; and (5) bark scratching instead of debarking to avoid bark beetle outbreaks while maintaining biodiversity. Windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks could be utilized to restore intensely managed forests of Central Europe to their natural composition and, structure. Furthermore, experimentally mimicked natural disturbances might help in gaining a mechanistic understanding of how natural disturbances affect biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forestry can help to mitigate climate change by storing carbon in trees, forest soils, and wood products. Forest owners can be subsidized if forestry removes carbon from the atmosphere and taxed if forestry produces emissions. Errors in forest inventory data can lead to losses in net present value (NPV) if management prescriptions are selected based on erroneous data. This study assesses the effect of inventory errors on economic losses in forest management when the objective is to maximize the total NPV of timber production and carbon payments. Errors similar to those in airborne laser scanning based forest inventory were simulated in stand attributes with a vine copula approach and nearest neighbor method. Carbon payments were based on the total carbon balance of forestry (including trees, soil, and wood-based products) and calculations were carried out for 30 years using carbon prices of 0, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 (SIC).t(-1). The results revealed that increasing the carbon price and decreasing the level of errors led to decreased losses in NPV. The inclusion of carbon payments for the maximization of the NPV decreased the effect of errors on the losses, which suggests that the value of collectingmore accurate forest inventory datamay decrease when the carbon price increases.

AB  - Crop and land management practices affect both the quality and quantity of soil organic matter (SOM) and hence are driving forces for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of tillage, fertilizer application and crop rotation on SOC in an agricultural area of southern Norway, where a soil fertility and crop rotation experiment was initiated in 1953 and a second experiment on tillage practices was initiated in 1983. The first experiment comprised 6-yr crop rotations with cereals only and 2-yr cereal and 4-yr grass rotations with recommended (base) and more than the recommended (above base) fertilizer application rates; the second experiment dealt with autumn-ploughed (conventional-till) plots and direct-drilled plots (no-till). Soil samples at 0-10 and 10-30 cm depths were collected in autumn 2009 and analysed for their C and N contents. The quality of SOM in the top layer was determined by C-13 solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The SOC stock did not differ significantly because of rotation or fertilizer application types, even after 56 yr. However, the no-till system showed a significantly higher SOC stock than the conventional-till system at the 0-10 cm depth after the 26 yr of experiment, but it was not significantly different at the 10-30 cm depth. In terms of quality, SOM was found to differ by tillage type, rate of fertilizer application and crop rotation. The no-till system showed an abundance of O-alkyl C, while conventional-till system indicated an apparently indirect enrichment in alkyl C, suggesting a more advanced stage of SOM decomposition. The long-term quantitative and qualitative effects on SOM suggest that adopting a no-tillage system and including grass in crop rotation and farmyard manure in fertilizer application may contribute to preserve soil fertility and mitigate climate change.

AB  - The challenge to harmonize nature-based tourism with species conservation is important both from an economic, cultural and ecological perspective. One approach for understanding this interaction is to compare the spatio-temporal overlap between tourism activities and the focal species' space use, with the purpose to identify areas, periods, and conditions in which tourism exerts the highest negative impact. Here, we combine GPS data from 66 wild reindeer with on-site surveys of tourist (n = 13434 respondents at 66 locations) and trail use counters (n = 99 sites) in three Norwegian national parks. Our findings highlight a large-scale segregation during the summer season, as wild reindeer move to areas less prone to disturbance by humans. Based on these findings, we discuss a management model to segregate tourists from wild reindeer in space and/or time during summer with the goal of long-term sustainable coexistence.

AB  - Conflicts among different ecosystem services have been shown to be common and potentially exacerbated by management interventions. In order to improve the sustainability of natural resource use, the occurrence of these conflicts and the effects that management actions have on them need to be understood. We studied the conflicts between ecosystem services and the potential to solve them by management choices in boreal production forests. Our study area consisted of nearly 30,000 forest stands which were simulated for 50 years into the future under alternative management scenarios. The study included four ecosystem services - timber production, bilberry production, carbon storage, and pest regulation and one biodiversity conservation objective defined as availability of deadwood resources. We 1) measured the conflicts among each pair of objectives, and 2) identified a compromise solution for each pair-wise conflict defined as one which simultaneously minimizes the losses for both objectives. Our results show that conflicts between timber production and other objectives are typical, severe, and difficult to solve, while non-extractive benefits including biodiversity conservation can be more easily reconciled with each other. To mitigate the most severe conflicts in boreal forests, increased diversity in management regimes is required. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development of secondary forest as post-mining land use in the surface coal mining degraded sites is of high research interest due to its potential to sequester atmospheric carbon (C). The objectives of this study were to assess the improvement in mine soil quality and C sequestration potential of the post mining reclaimed land with time. Hence, this study was conducted in reclaimed chronosequence sites (young, intermediate and old) of a large open cast coal project (Central Coal Fields Limited, Jharkhand, India) and results were compared to a reference forest site (Sal forest, Shorea robusta). Mine soil quality was assessed in terms of accretion of soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N) and soil CO2 flux along with the age of revegetation. After 14 years of revegetation, SOC and N concentrations increased three and five-fold, respectively and found equivalent to the reference site. Accretion of SOC stock was estimated to be 1.9 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Total ecosystem C sequestered after 2-14 years of revegetation increased from 8 Mg C ha(-1) to 90 Mg C ha(-1) (30-333 Mg CO2 ha(-1)) with an average rate of 6.4 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Above ground biomass contributes maximum C sequestrate (50%) in revegetated site. CO2 flux increased with age of revegetation and found 11, 33 and 42 Mg CO2 ha(-1)year(-1) in younger, intermediate and older dumps, respectively. Soil respiration in revegetated site is more influenced by the temperature than soil moisture. Results of the study also showed that trees like, Dalbergia sissoo and Heterophragma adenophyllum should be preferred for revegetation of mine degraded sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With climate change, the area affected by and the intensity of forest disturbances such as windthrow, insect outbreaks and fire will be increasing. Post-disturbance forest management will be varied, and it is difficult to predict how much natural succession will be allowed in comparison to reforestation. Both, disturbance and reforestation will affect forest biodiversity globally, but potential shifts in species distribution, abundance and community composition are poorly understood.
   We studied the response of breeding bird communities to windstorm-induced forest loss (windthrow followed by salvage logging) and different reforestation strategies in one of Central Europe's largest contiguous wind-throw areas created by storm Kyrill in 2007. A decade after the disturbance, we compared bird species diversity, population densities and community composition on plots in replanted beech, replanted conifers and secondary succession (all salvage-logged after the storm), with undisturbed mature (ca. 50-80 years old) Norway spruce Picea abies as a control, in the setting of a natural experiment.
   Of the stands blown down, 95% were Norway Spruce. Reforestation strategies varied, with Spruce and non-native conifers planted on twice the area that was replanted with European Beech Fagus sylvestris. Large areas were still dominated by successional tree species a decade after the storm, especially birch Betula spp., mirroring recommendations of sub-national forestry agencies to include secondary succession in future forest development. Birds responded strongly to windstorm-induced forest loss, with a pronounced community turnover. Species associated with high conifer stands reached significantly lower densities on sample plots in disturbed areas. Replanted areas were characterized by mostly ubiquitous bird species. Areas dominated by secondary succession, especially birch, were characterized by high densities of long-distance migrants (often species of conservation concern) and shrubland species, among them several indicator species.
   Our results suggest that an increase of forest disturbance across Central Europe will lead to a pronounced reorganisation of biodiversity. Strategies that allow more secondary succession, and avoid replanting allochthonous tree species are likely to benefit populations of depleted bird species, even at salvage-logged and cleared disturbance sites.

AB  - This study aimed to test whether fungal community on moose (Alces alces) dung is affected by habitat. We used dung of homogenous origin, composition, and age. Dung was placed in three different habitats in north-eastern Sweden, and was checked again after 35-36 d. Of the 26 species of fungi found, 12 were new to the region, 17 had never been observed on moose dung, and two were not previously described. We found a significant difference in species composition between the habitats, with a low number of species in the spruce forest and about a threefold increase in the pine forest and the open mire. Species diversity was negatively associated with degree of insect attack. This suggests that insects feeding either on the dung or the fungi (spores, mycelia) may be an important factor explaining the observed pattern. In order to test this hypothesis we need to run experiments excluding insects.

AB  - The impacts of human-induced disturbance on birds have been studied in growing extent, but there are relatively few studies about the effects of recreation on forest bird communities in protected areas. In this paper, the relative importance of recreation as well as environmental variables on bird communities in Oulanka National Park, in northeastern Finland, was investigated using general additive models (GAM). Bird data collected using the line transect method along hiking trails and in undisturbed control areas were related to number of visits, area of tourism infrastructure, and habitat variables. We further examined the impact of spatial autocorrelation by calculating an autocovariate term for GAMs. Our results indicate that number of visits affects the occurrence and composition of bird communities, but it had no impact on total species richness. Open-cup nesters breeding on the ground showed strongest negative response to visitor pressure, whereas the open-cup nesters nesting in trees and shrubs were more tolerant. For cavity-nesting species, recreation had no significant impact. The contribution of the number of visits was generally low also in models in which it was selected, and the occurrence of birds was mainly determined by habitat characteristics of the area. However, our results show that the recreation-induced disturbance with relatively low visitor pressure can have negative impacts on some bird species and groups of species and should be considered in management of protected areas with recreational activities.

AB  - This study examines the risks and returns associated with payments for ecosystem services (PES) for private forestland using modern portfolio theory. PES schemes for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation were considered. Pricing data for European carbon emissions offsets and the Finnish biodiversity conservation scheme Trading in Natural Values', and Finnish forest inventory data were used to model ex-post empirical results. The forest owner's portfolio could be comprised of either current forest management or a PES scheme with postponed harvesting; considerations for investing harvest income in equities and bonds were included. The correlation between a PES scheme's return series and timber returns was higher for the biodiversity scheme leading to relatively limited financial diversification benefits under current prices. Increasing the biodiversity conservation price level reduced this effect. For the climate scheme, removing the declining linear trend from the pricing data did not reduce the relatively greater diversification benefits. Overall these benefits were also greater on fertile forest site types than lower quality sites. These results indicate that the policy implications of designing socially efficient PES pricing include an important trade-off between increasing price risks for private landowners and decreasing marginal costs for society.

AB  - The extent of protected areas is increasing worldwide. Traditionally a great deal of the protected lands have been situated in ecologically and economically marginal regions, such as mountains, often on state-owned land. In recent years, however, new designations have increasingly been applied to areas with more private land, more people, greater economic activity, and thus have resulted in a higher degree of conflict. Due to several forces, public involvement in natural resource planning is developing rapidly. This development is largely driven by environmental management institutions as a means to improve efficiency and equity in planning processes. Although well intended, these efforts often meet with problems caused by a lack of understanding of the community perspectives on resource conflicts. In this study we discuss our experiences from following the process of expansion of a national park in southern Norway. We argue that it is essential to understand the complex relationships and meanings local people develop with their surroundings in order to facilitate negotiation over contested issues. This has important implications for the way managers apply different types of knowledge, develop strategies, and communicate with local interests.

AB  - This paper initially reviews the occurrence of clones in nature, through geological history to the present day. Studies of the current natural population structure of Picea abies are reviewed as a background to assessing the ecological threats associated with somatic embryogenesis (SE) of the major commercial tree in Scandinavia. These threats are judged as most likely to result from (a) loss of genetic diversity, (b) loss of adaptation of tree populations, and (c) changes in other components of the ecosystem due to genetic changes of the dominant forest tree. Particular attention is given to the potential effects of SE on altered risk of impact from biotic damaging agents and effects on other species. The potential effects of SE on ecosystem services are discussed. The chapter ends with management recommendations.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is altering the management of production forests. These changes are motivated by the need to adapt to the uncertainties and risks of climate change, and by the need to enlist their carbon storage and sequestration capacity as part of global mitigation efforts. These changes do however raise concerns regarding the potential implications for forest biodiversity. Here we evaluate these concerns by assessing the biodiversity implications of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (CCAMS) being implemented in the production forests of Sweden. We do so by identifying biodiversity goals aimed specifically at closing the existing gap between the habitat requirements of forest-dependent species, and the conditions provided by production forests, in terms of tree species composition, forest structures, and spatio-temporal forest patterns. We then use the existing literature to determine whether and by which pathway each CCAMS is likely to bridge or extend this gap. Our results indicate that CCAMS will often come into direct or partial conflict with Swedish biodiversity goals in production forests. Furthermore, some CCAMS which are inconsistent with biodiversity goals, such as logging residue removal, are being implemented more extensively than those which were most consistent with biodiversity goals. We nevertheless challenge the necessity of setting the preservation of forest biodiversity against climate change mitigation and adaptation. We clarify how CCAMS with negative biodiversity implications may still be implemented without adverse outcomes, if coupled with conservation interventions, or combined with other CCAMS deemed complementary in habitat provision.

AB  - The current knowledge of pseudoscorpions in Estonia is summarized, based on specimens preserved in various Estonian collections and new material collected from 1993 to 2015. Altogether 474 studied specimens belonged to 14 species, including nine species recorded from Estonia for the first time. Supplemented by Apocheiridium rossicum, listed by literature data only, the number of known Estonian pseudoscorpions is now set at 15. The findings of Mesochelifer ressli are the northernmost known for the species. Some ecological and phenological observations were made on the most common species, along with notes on the habitat preferences of other species and the use of different trapping methods. The composition of the known Estonian fauna is compared with the published records from the neighbouring countries, revealing a highest similarity to the Finnish fauna.

AB  - Understanding to what extent species mixtures modify the growth of trees and their responses to climate, in comparison with pure stands, is important to support forest adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this sense, information stored in tree rings can be useful to evaluate whether the positive relationship between species diversity and tree productivity holds true under disturbance (e.g., drought). This paper aimed at assessing (i) how radial growth of trees responded to local variation in climate patterns (Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPED, and (ii) whether there was a relationship with intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) and tree-ring 8180 in two important tree species, occurring in pure and mixed forest stands. Three sites with similar topographic and pedo-climatic conditions were identified in a single location in the Italian Alps. The first two are characterized by pure stands, respectively dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Scots pine (Pines sylvestris L.). The third site refers to a mixed stand of both previous species. In particular, in order to assess the annual changes in WUEi, we analysed delta C-18 in tree rings. The influence of the stomatal conductance was also investigated through delta O-18. Our results indicated that: (i) Basal Area Increments (BAI) consistently increased in all stands except for the pure Scots pine stand, in the 1994-2003 period; (ii) SPEI highlighted a drought period between 1991 and 2007 (62.2% of the average precipitation); and (iii) the WUEi values were generally higher in pure than in mixed stands, especially for European beech. The divergence between BAI and SPEI values in the 1990s and early 2000s could be a consequence of moderate thinning. We conclude that past forest management (namely thinning) can be more influential on tree growth than current climatic oscillations.

AB  - The study used an existing forest planning system to analyze the influence of fuel feedstock harvesting and type of forest management on the carbon balance of forestry. The carbon balance module simulated changes in the carbon storage in living biomass, dead organic matter and products. Carbon releases from timber harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the carbon balance, as well as the substitution, recycling and reuse effects of different types of wood products (avoided releases from fossil fuels due to the use of wood). Prediction models were developed for the initial pools of wood products and dead organic matter. The results show that collecting branches, stumps and coarse roots for bioenergy improves the carbon balance very little during the first 30 years of biofuel harvesting. This is because decreased carbon balance of forest soil partially cancels the positive substitution effects of fuel feedstock harvesting. Using high thinnings and continuous cover management instead of low thinnings, clear felling and artificial regeneration have an immediate positive effect on the carbon balance. This is because the sizes of the wood product and living biomass pools increase, and manufacturing releases decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human-induced disturbances to ecosystems cause a direct loss of biodiversity, and also alter the inherent processes that shape ecosystems even after the main disturbance has ceased. Therefore, is it important to understand the ongoing consequences of past and present land use practices on both above- and belowground components of agroecosystems. Our study takes a detailed investigation of what shapes communities in semi-natural grasslands under long-term management as either pastures or meadows. We investigated the relative importance of land use (land management (LM) and land use intensity (LUI)) and abiotic conditions (soil, topographic, climatic) across five grassland sites in central Germany in explaining species occurrence patterns of vascular plants and soil fungi. Analyses included a hierarchical joint-species distribution modeling approach to uncover the role of possible drivers shaping the local communities.
   Our results show that abiotic factors are of particularly high importance compared to LM and LUI for both vascular plant and soil fungal communities. In general, the relative importance of explanatory variables was similar across both taxon groups, however, for plant communities, local climate conditions were more important, while for fungal communities the soil variables (e.g., soil acidity and fertility including soil carbon and potassium concentrations) played a more prominent role. Species-specific responses to the respective variables showed some similarity across the taxon groups, however less so than expected given the long legacy of past LM. Here we found that approximately 50% of the plant and fungi species had clear LM preferences and responses to LUI. More plant species were positively related to pasture than meadow management, while the opposite was found for fungal species. Our findings advance the understanding of how abiotic conditions and human land use impact local species communities in managed semi-natural grasslands, aiding further research and policy development for conserving multitrophic diversity within these biodiversity rich habitats. Our results highlight the importance of controlling for soil and climate in studying the impact of land use, and of considering the environmental context at both small and larger spatial grains when making land management and biodiversity conservation decisions. In so doing, the complexity of ecological processes within managed systems are accounted for and prioritized, promoting both conservation and ecological functioning of the agroecosystem.

AB  - The choice between even- and uneven-aged forest management is a topical issue as the negative impacts of clear-felling are being increasingly criticized and the profitability of even-aged management has been questioned. This study compared these management systems in spruce and pine stands in terms of timber, carbon, and bilberry benefits, all of which can be predicted with reasonable accuracy and quantified in terms of money. Management was optimized by maximizing the total net present value (NPV) of the three benefits in a steady-state situation. The currently recommended type of even-aged management was also included in the comparisons. Uneven-aged management was the best in terms of the total NPV and with respect to bilberry benefits (NPV of bilberry harvesting). It was also better than even-aged management in terms of timber benefits when the discount rate was more than 1%. The ranking was less clear in terms of carbon sequestration and discounted carbon benefits.

AB  - Global climate change and related land use changes are expected to impose unprecedented pressures on coastal biodiversity and ecosystem processes. To sustainably manage coastal ecosystems, it is crucial to predict the consequences of human activities for coastal ecosystems and identify areas for directed abatement measures. Empirical data together with expert knowledge and evidence from the literature were integrated into a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) for a marine protected area, the Kosterhavet National Park off the Swedish west coast. The variability and interactions of anthropogenic pressures and two key ecosystem components, eelgrass meadows and northern shrimp stock, were tested under four storylines of environmental change. The results show that of the influential drivers of environmental change, only three variables (bottom trawling, leisure boating and aquaculture) are manageable within the national park itself. Scenario analysis suggested that notable gains of both ecosystem components were most likely under a storyline of sustainable development, assuming a radiative forcing of 4.5 W/m2 by 2100 in concert with a preventive cooperation among neighboring countries and a tighter restriction of commercial and recreational uses in the park area. The findings suggest that the sustainable management of eelgrass meadows and northern shrimp stock in Kosterhavet National Park requires both local measures at the scale of the park's water bodies and, to a greater part, also regional measures, e.g., to reduce nutrient influx from adjacent water bodies. In conclusion, this approach can help practitioners to make more informed management decisions and foresee the effects of routes of socio-economic development.

AB  - Renibacterium salmoninarum is the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease, a major pathogen of salmonid fish species worldwide. Very low levels of intra-species genetic diversity have hampered efforts to understand the transmission dynamics and recent evolutionary history of this Gram-positive bacterium. We exploited recent advances in the next-generation sequencing technology to generate genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 68 diverse R. salmoninarum isolates representing broad geographical and temporal ranges and different host species. Phylogenetic analysis robustly delineated two lineages (lineage 1 and lineage 2); futhermore, dating analysis estimated that the time to the most recent ancestor of all the isolates is 1239 years ago (95% credible interval (CI) 444-2720 years ago). Our data reveal the intercontinental spread of lineage 1 over the last century, concurrent with anthropogenic movement of live fish, feed and ova for aquaculture purposes and stocking of recreational fisheries, whilst lineage 2 appears to have been endemic in wild Eastern Atlantic salmonid stocks before commercial activity. The high resolution of the SNP-based analyses allowed us to separate closely related isolates linked to neighboring fish farms, indicating that they formed part of single outbreaks. We were able to demonstrate that the main lineage 1 subgroup of R. salmoninarum isolated from Norway and the UK likely represent an introduction to these areas similar to 40 years ago. This study demonstrates the promise of this technology for analysis of micro and medium scale evolutionary relationships in veterinary and environmental microorganisms, as well as human pathogens.

AB  - This document examines bio-physical limits of bio-fuels and bio-sequestration of carbon by examining available solar radiation and observed efficiencies with which natural ecosystems and agricultural systems convert that energy to biomass. It compares these energy/carbon exchanges with national levels of energy use and carbon emissions for Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States.
   Globally primary energy consumption (related carbon emissions) is currently equivalent to similar to 0.06% of the incident solar energy, and 43% of the energy (carbon) captured by photosynthesis.
   The nations fall into three categories. Those with primary energy consumption that is: 1-10% (Japan, Korea and Singapore); similar to 0.1% (China, UK and the US) and; 0.1-0.01% (Australia, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Sweden) of incident solar radiation. The percentage of energy captured in biomass follows this pattern, but generally lower by similar to 3 orders of magnitude.
   The energy content of traded wheat, corn and rice represents conversion efficiencies of solar radiation of 0.08-0.17% and for sugar close to 1%, ignoring energy use in production and conversion of biomass to fuels.
   The study implies that bio-fuels or bio-sequestration can only be a small part of an inclusive portfolio of actions towards a low carbon future and minimised net emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change poses certain threats to the World's forests. That is, tree performance declines if species-specific, climatic thresholds are surpassed. Prominent climatic changes negatively affecting tree performance are mainly associated with so-called hotter droughts. In combination with biotic pathogens, hotter droughts cause a higher tree vulnerability and thus mortality. As a consequence, global forests are expected to undergo vast changes in the course of climate change. Changed climatic conditions may on the one hand locally result in more frequent dieback of a particular tree species but on the other hand allow other-locally yet absent species-to establish themselves, thereby potentially changing local tree-species diversity. Although several studies provide valuable insights into potential risks of prominent European tree species, we yet lack a comprehensive assessment on how and to which extent the composition of European forests may change. To overcome this research gap, we here project future tree-species compositions of European forests. We combine the concept of climate analogs with national forest inventory data to project the tree-species composition for the 26 most important European tree species at any given location in Europe for the period 2061-2090 and the two most relevant CMIP5 scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Our results indicate significant changes in European forests species compositions. Species richness generally declined in the Mediterranean and Central European lowlands, while Scandinavian and Central European high-elevation forests were projected an increasing diversity. Moreover, 76% (RCP 4.5) and 80% (RCP 8.5) of the investigated locations indicated a decreasing abundance of the locally yet most abundant tree species while 74 and 68% were projected an increasing tree-species diversity. Altogether, our study confirms the expectation of European forests undergoing remarkable changes until the end of the 21st century (i.e., 2061-2090) and provides a scientific basement for climate change adaptation with important implications for forestry and nature conservation.

AB  - The ecology and diversity of the macrofungal species assemblages associated with woody material in four plots with differing wildfire histories in a Tasmanian tall, wet, native Eucalyptus obliqua forest were investigated. The four woody substrata (CWD, other dead wood ODW, stags and living trees) supported substantially different macrofungal assemblages, although there was some degree of overlap between CWD and ODW. The best separation between assemblages occurring on all kinds of wood, or on individual pieces of CWD, was obtained when the 100 10 x 10 m subplots of the study were grouped into classes based on the most frequently occurring higher vascular plant species within each subplot. Three polypore species were identified as being possible indicators of bio-diverse old E. obliqua forests. The sustainable management of these forests will require retaining dead wood of all sizes, species and decay stages to maintain wood-inhabiting fungal diversity.

AB  - Nordic catchments provide a variety of ecosystem services, from harvestable goods to mitigation of climate change and recreational possibilities. Flows of supplied ecosystem services depend on a broad range of factors, including climate, hydrology, land management and human population density. The aims of this study were: 1) to quantify the total economic value (TEV) of consumed ecosystem services across Nordic catchments, 2) to explain variation in ecosystem service value using socio-geographic and natural factors as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression, and 3) to determine which societal groups benefit from these ecosystem services. Furthermore, we tested the scientific rigour of our framework based on the concept of final ecosystem services (FES). We used a spatially explicit, integrative framework for ecosystem services quantification to compile data on final ecosystem services provision from six catchments across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Our estimates showed a broad variation in TEV and in the proportion contributed by separate services, with the highest TEV of euro7,199 +/- 4,561 ha(-1) y(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation) in the Norwegian Orrevassdraget catchment, and the lowest TEV of euro183 +/- 517 ha(-1) y(-1) in the Finnish Simojoki catchment. The value of material services was dependent on both geographic factors and land management practices, while the value of immaterial services was strongly dependent on population density and the availability of water. Using spatial data on land use, forest productivity and population density in a GIS analysis showed where hotspots of ecosystem services supply are located, and where specific stakeholder groups benefit most. We show that our framework is applicable to a broad variety of data sources and across countries, making international comparative analyses possible.

AB  - The soil seed banks of three roadsides, one horsetrack, one stream verge and two agricultural fields were sampled in an agricultural landscape in southern Norway. Altogether 61 different vascular plant species germinated from soil samples from the five linear habitats, while only 16 species germinated from the agricultural fields. The low species number and low seed densities in the fields probably reflect modern weed management. Each linear habitat contained more or less specific subsets of plant species. The relative abundance of the different species exhibited an approximately log-normal distribution. Species composition in the seed banks of the linear habitats was compared with the aboveground vegetation. The seed bank had a higher frequency of annual species than the vegetation. Surveys restricted to the aboveground vegetation will tend to underestimate the number of species present by 15-30%.

AB  - Using aerial photographs, we examined the changes in the forest matrix from 1953 to 2003 in the Oulanka National Park and commercial forests in the northern part of the municipality of Kuusamo. The changes concerned the potential winter grazing grounds available to the existing reindeer population. The main changes in the commercial forests took place between 1953 and 1977, during which time the mean forest-patch size shrank by 65%, and the number of patches increased by 78%. From 1953 to 2003, the total area of epiphytic lichens and ground-lichen pastures decreased by 48.6%. The area of ground-lichen pastures decreased by 20%, and the area of common hair grass pastures doubled. The forest matrix transition in the commercial forests changed not only the spatial configuration and areas of different pasture patches, but also the grazing pressure at the remaining pasture sites. In the national park, the changes in grazing pressure were related only to the changes in numbers of reindeer. In general, the conditions of reindeer pastures are a result of interaction between different land-use components.

AB  - Blanket peat and other moorland soils store the largest proportion of the soil organic carbon resource (SOC) in the United Kingdom. However, current understanding of the quantity and distribution of upland SOC is limited and approaches are needed to quantify carbon storage over large areas, whilst adequately representing spatial variability at a smaller scale. This article presents a methodology for quantifying and mapping SOC distribution at a landscape scale in blanket peatlands on Dartmoor, South West England. Using stratified sampling, twenty-nine cores were taken from a range of depths within each of the soil types found in the study area. Depth was strongly correlated with bulk density (r(2) = 0.70, P < 0.001) and loss on ignition (r(2) = 0.51, P < 0.001) for blanket peat, with weaker or non-existent relationships in other soil types. These regression relationships were used with peat depth mapping, to model carbon distribution and quantity. The results estimate 9.7 +/- 2.97 Mt of carbon is stored in Dartmoor's organic soils, and that blanket peat has a much higher carbon content per unit area than other organic soils. Sensitivity analysis revealed that bulk density and peat depth were equally influential in calculating carbon stocks, whilst variability in organic matter content was relatively unimportant. A comparison between the Dartmoor inventory and the national SOC inventory showed reasonable agreement for total C storage, but on an individual cell-by-cell basis disagreement between the inventories was often large. We conclude that when higher resolution SOC distribution is required (<100 km(2)), such as for individual land holdings and management, the approach presented within this article provides a suitable carbon inventory.

AB  - The severity and spatial extent of bark-beetle outbreaks substantially increased in recent decades worldwide. The ongoing controversy about natural forest recovery after these outbreaks highlights the need for individual-based long-term studies, which disentangle processes driving forest regeneration. However, such studies have been lacking. To fill this gap, we followed the fates of 2,552 individual seedlings for 12 years after a large-scale bark-beetle outbreak that caused complete canopy dieback in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southeast Germany. We explore the contribution of advance, disturbance-related, and post-disturbance regeneration to forest recovery. Most seedlings originated directly within the three-year dieback of canopy trees induced by bark-beetle outbreak. After complete canopy dieback, the establishment of new seedlings was minimal. Surprisingly, advance regeneration formed only a minor part of all regeneration. However, because it had the highest survival rate, its importance increased over time. The most important factor influencing the survival of seedlings after disturbance was their height. Survival was further modified by microsite: seedlings established on dead wood survived best, whereas almost all seedlings surrounded by graminoids died. For 5 cm tall seedlings, annual mortality ranged from 20 to 50% according to the rooting microsite. However, for seedlings taller than 50 cm, annual mortality was below 5% at all microsites. While microsite modified seedling mortality, it did not affect seedling height growth. A model of regeneration dynamics based on short-term observations accurately predicts regeneration height growth, but substantially underestimates mortality rate, thus predicting more surviving seedlings than were observed. We found that P. abies forests were able to regenerate naturally even after severe bark-beetle outbreaks owing to advance and particularly disturbance-related regeneration. This, together with microsite-specific mortality, yields structurally and spatially diverse forests. Our study thus highlights the so far unrecognized importance of disturbance-related regeneration for stand recovery after bark-beetle outbreaks.

AB  - Biomass fuels currently (1994) supply around 14% of the world's energy, but most of this is in the form of traditional fuelwood, residues and dung, which is often inefficient and can be environmentally detrimental. Biomass can supply heat and electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels. A number of developed countries derive a significant amount of their primary energy from biomass: USA 4%, Finland 18%, Sweden 16% and Austria 13%. Presently biomass energy supplies at least 2 ET year(-1) in Western Europe which is about 4% of primary energy (54 EJ). Estimates show a likely potential in Europe in 2050 of 9.0-13.5 EJ depending on land areas (10% of useable land, 33 Mha), yields (10-15 oven-dry tonnes (ODt) ha(-1)), and recoverable residues (25% of harvestable). This biomass contribution represents 17-30% of projected total energy requirements up to 2050. The relative contribution of biofuels in the future will depend on markets and incentives, on continuous research and development progress, and on environmental requirements. Land constraints are not considered significant because of the predicted surpluses in land and food, and the near balance in wood and wood products in Europe.
   There is considerable potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy carriers such as electricity, gases and transportation fuels, whilst continuing to provide for traditional uses of biomass; this modernisation of biomass and the industrial investment is already happening in many countries. When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include improved land management, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialised countries, provision of modem energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, a reduction of CO2 levels, waste control, and nutrient recycling. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy cropping than from annual arable crops which are short-term alternative feedstocks for fuels. Agroforestry systems can play an important role in providing multiple benefits to growers and the community, besides energy. In order to ameliorate CO2 emissions, using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels (complete replacement, co-firing, etc.) is more beneficial from social and economic perspectives than sequestering the carbon in forests.
   Case studies are presented for several developed countries and the constraints involved in modernising biomass energy along with the potential for turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed. It is concluded that the long term impacts of biomass programmes and projects depend mainly on ensuring income generation, environmental sustainability, flexibility and replicability, while taking account of local conditions and providing multiple benefits, which is an important attribute of agroforestry-type systems. Biomass for energy must be environmentally acceptable in order to ensure its widespread adoption as a modern energy source. Implementation of biomass projects requires governmental policy initiatives that will internalise the external economic, social and environmental costs of conventional fuel sources so that biomass fuels can become competitive on a 'level playing field'.

AB  - Non-native tree species have been widely planted or have become naturalized in most forested landscapes. It is not clear if native trees species collectively differ in ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) diversity and communities from that of non-native tree species. Alternatively, EMF species community similarity may be more determined by host plant phylogeny than by whether the plant is native or non-native. We examined these unknowns by comparing two genera, native and non-native Quercus robur and Quercus rubra and native and non-native Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra in a 35-year-old common garden in Poland. Using molecular and morphological approaches, we identified EMF species from ectomycorrhizal root tips and sporocarps collected in the monoculture tree plots. A total of 69 EMF species were found, with 38 species collected only as sporocarps, 18 only as ectomycorrhizas, and 13 both as ectomycorrhizas and sporocarps. The EMF species observed were all native and commonly associated with a Holarctic range in distribution. We found that native Q. robur had ca. 120% higher total EMF species richness than the non-native Q. rubra, while native P. sylvestris had ca. 25% lower total EMF species richness than non-native P. nigra. Thus, across genera, there was no evidence that native species have higher EMF species diversity than exotic species. In addition, we found a higher similarity in EMF communities between the two Pinus species than between the two Quercus species. These results support the naturalization of non-native trees by means of mutualistic associations with cosmopolitan and novel fungi.

AB  - Forests and forestry can make substantial contributions to attempts to reduce the amount of CO? in the atmosphere. However, management regimes differ in their effects on CO, dynamics, so this study was undertaken to assess the effects of various thinning strategies on the following variables: the amount of biofuel produced that could replace fossil fuels; mean annual increment of biomass; the standing biomass. In the present study, 50 blocks of Scots pine (Pinussylvestris L.) and 21 of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), established in young stands in Sweden between 1966 and 1984, were examined. Five different thinning regimes were considered: 'low thinning', 'one heavy thinning', 'thinning from above', 'low thinning + fertilization' and 'unthinned'. In the spruce blocks, there was no significant difference in mean annual increment between the thinning regimes, suggesting that fertilization did not have a positive affect on the aboveground biomass. In the pine blocks, 'low thinning + fertilization' was the most suitable thinning regime, since it led to a significantly larger mean annual increment than the other regimes and the quantity of biofuel produced was also large. 'Unthinned' had the largest standing biomass for both species, which resulted in that 'unthinned' is preferred if the objective is to maximize the standing biomass and thereby the carbon pool.

AB  - Colonization history, landscape structure, and environmental conditions may influence patterns of neutral genetic variation because of their effects on gene flow and reproductive mode. We compared variation at microsatellite loci within and among 26 Arabidopsis lyrata populations in two disjunct areas of its distribution in northern Europe (Norway and Sweden). The two areas probably share a common colonization history but differ in size (Norwegian range markedly larger than Swedish range), landscape structure (mountains vs. coast), and habitat conditions likely to affect patterns of gene flow and opportunities for sexual reproduction. Within-population genetic diversity was not related to latitude but was higher in Sweden than in Norway. Population differentiation was stronger among Norwegian than among Swedish populations (F-ST = 0.23 vs. F-ST = 0.18). The frequency of clonal propagation (proportion of identical multilocus genotypes) increased with decreasing population size, was higher in Norwegian than in Swedish populations, but was not related to altitude or substrate. Differences in genetic structure are discussed in relation to population characteristics and range size in the two areas. The results demonstrate that the possibility of clonal propagation should be considered when developing strategies for sampling and analyzing data in ecological and genetic studies of this emerging model species.

AB  - Models for predicting the biomass of forest trees are becoming increasingly important for assessing forest resources and carbon sequestration in forests. We developed functions for predicting the biomass and basic density of above- and below-ground parts of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Denmark. Separate models were developed for branches (including foliage), stem and the below-ground stump and root system as well as for the aggregate components of total above-ground biomass and total tree biomass. Trees were sampled in 14 forest stands, reflecting the range of growth conditions and thinning practises of Norway spruce in Denmark. Because of inclusion of experimental plots, data reflected a wider range of thinning practices than commonly used in forestry practice. The data included measurements of biomass and basic density from 114 trees, two of which were regarded as outliers and consequently excluded in the final model estimation. The final models reflected known properties of tree growth and allocation of biomass among different tree components of even-aged Norway spruce. The models were successful in predicting biomass, basic density and biomass expansion factors across a wide variety of tree sizes, stand treatments and growth conditions. The models are believed to substantially improve national estimates of carbon sequestration and biomass resources.

AB  - Observational evidence suggests that forests in the Northern Alps are changing at an increasing rate as a consequence of climate change. Yet, it remains unclear whether the acceleration of forest change will continue in the future, or whether downregulating feedbacks will eventually decouple forest dynamics from climate change. Here we studied future forest dynamics at Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany by means of a process-based forest landscape model, simulating an ensemble of 22 climate projections until the end of the 21st century. Our objectives were (i) to assess whether the observed acceleration of forest dynamics will continue in the future, (ii) to analyze how uncertainty in future climate translates to variation in future forest disturbance, structure, and composition, and (iii) to determine the main drivers of future forest dynamics. We found that forest dynamics continue to accelerate in the coming decades, with a trend towards denser, structurally more complex and more species rich forests. However, changes in forest structure leveled off in the second half of the 21st century regardless of climate scenario. In contrast, climate scenarios caused trajectories of tree species change to diverge in the second half of the 21st century, with stabilization under RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios and accelerated loss of conifers under RCP 8.5. Disturbance projections were 3 to 20 times more variable than future climate, whereas projected future forest structure and composition varied considerably less than climate. Indirect effects of climate change via alterations of the disturbance regime had a stronger impact on future forest dynamics than direct effects. Our findings suggest that dampening feedbacks within forest dynamics will decelerate forest change in the second half of the 21st century. However, warming beyond the levels projected under RCP 4.5 might profoundly alter future forest disturbance and composition, challenging conservation efforts and ecosystem service supply.

AB  - Although forest disturbances have become more frequent and severe due to ongoing climate change, our understanding of post-disturbance development of vegetation and tree-herb layer interactions remains limited. An extreme windstorm, which occurred on 19 November 2004, destroyed Picea abies (L.) H. Karst dominated forests in the High Tatra Mts. Here, we studied short-term changes in diversity, species composition, and aboveground biomass of trees and herb layer vegetation, including mutual relationships that elucidate tree-herb interactions during post-disturbance succession. Assessment of species composition and tree biomass measurements were performed at 50 sample plots (4 x 4 m) along two transects 12, 14, and 16 years after the forest destruction. Heights and stem base diameters of about 730 trees were measured and subsequently used for the calculation of aboveground tree biomass using species-specific allometric relationships. Aboveground biomass of herb layer was quantified at 300 subplots (20 x 20 cm) by destructive sampling. Species richness and spatial vegetation heterogeneity did not significantly change, and species composition exhibited small changes in accordance with expected successional trajectories. While aboveground tree biomass increased by about 190%, biomass of annual herb shoots decreased by about 68% and biomass of perennial herb shoots was stable during the studied period. The contribution of trees to total aboveground biomass increased from 83% to 97%. After 16 years of forest stands recovery, tree biomass represented approximately 13% of forest biomass before the disturbance. Herb layer biomass, particularly the biomass of annual herb shoots, was more closely related to tree cover than to tree biomass and its decline could be assigned to gradual tree growth. Our study provides clear evidence that short-term successional processes in post-disturbance vegetation are much better detectable by biomass than by diversity or compositional measures and emphasized the importance of light conditions in tree-herb competitive interactions.

AB  - There has been much interest recently in large-scale forest conservation and the development of forest habitat networks, but the available work is mainly couched in general terms, or lies inaccessible in commissioned reports. In this study we developed a method for identifying priority areas for native woodland creation and restoration using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Ecological criteria were employed that integrate the requirements for successful woodland expansion from the nature conservation point of view and specific policy aims. The Snowdonia National Park in Wales, UK, was used as a pilot area for developing and testing the methodology, but it could be used in any analysis requiring the identification of optimal locations for native woodland expansion at a regional or large-district scale.

AB  - Several cities in Sweden are aiming for climate neutrality within a few decades and for negative emissions thereafter. Combined biochar, heat, and power production is an option to achieve carbon sequestration for cities relying on biomass-fuelled district heating, while biochar use could mitigate environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. By using prospective life cycle assessment, the climate impact of the pyrolysis of woodchips in Stockholm is compared with two reference scenarios based on woodchip combustion. The pyrolysis of woodchips produces heat and power for the city of Stockholm, and biochar whose potential use as a feed and manure additive on Swedish dairy farms is explored. The climate change mitigation trade-off between bioenergy production and biochar carbon sequestration in Stockholm's context is dominated by the fate of marginal power. If decarbonisation of power is achieved, building a new pyrolysis plant becomes a better climate option than conventional combustion. Effects of cascading biochar use in animal husbandry are uncertain but could provide 10-20% more mitigation than direct biochar soil incorporation. These results help design regional biochar systems that combine negative carbon dioxide emissions with increased methane and nitrous oxide mitigation efforts and can also guide the development of minimum performance criteria for biochar products.

AB  - We investigated how people's recreational activities, values, and land use preferences are related to the protection level, biodiversity and cultural heritage values of nature-based tourism areas in northern Finland. We assessed peoples' opinions using a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) and analyzed the data together with spatial biodiversity and cultural heritage data from the same area. Associations between the PPGIS place markings with the protection level and biodiversity values were quite low, and for the cultural heritage sites they were altogether missing. Negative preferences were often marked in areas with high numbers of sites rated as pleasant and they overlapped with each other, indicating conflicting preferences. Since most activities are not noticeably related to the protection level or biodiversity values of a site they can be planned so as to protect the biodiversity of the area.

AB  - Populations at species' range margins are expected to show lower genetic diversity than populations at the core of the range. Yet, long-lived, widespread tree species are expected to be resistant to genetic impoverishment, thus showing comparatively high genetic diversity within populations and low differentiation among populations. Here, we study the distribution of genetic variation in the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) at its range margin in Finland at two hierarchical scales using 15 microsatellite loci. At a regional scale, we compared variation within versus among three oak populations. At a landscape scale, we examined genetic structuring within one of these populations, growing on an island of ca 5 km(2). As expected, we found the majority of genetic variation in Q. robur to occur within populations. Nonetheless, differentiation among populations was markedly high (F-ST = 0.12) compared with values reported for populations of Q. robur closer to the core of its range. At the landscape level, some spatial and temporal sub-structuring was observed, likely explained by the history of land-use on the island. Overall, Q. robur fulfils the expectation of the central-marginal hypothesis of high differentiation among marginal populations, but the notable population differentiation has most likely been influenced also by the long, ongoing fragmentation of populations. Finnish oak populations may still be adjusting to the drastic habitat changes of the past centuries. Preservation of genetic variation within the remaining stands is thus an important factor in the conservation of Q. robur at its range margin.

AB  - Decline of dead wood in managed boreal forests has variously affected polypore species that use it as their substrate, some now being listed as threatened while some are still thriving. Management of polypore diversity requires species-specific information about their occurrence probabilities, which partially depend on stand dead wood availability and other properties.
   We implemented an ensemble of polypore habitat models to simulations of stand and dead wood availability estimated with a decomposition model we fitted to data. We asked how management of a boreal Norway spruce stand influences the dead wood availability and polypore occurrence probabilities and their diversity.
   Simulations of multiple polypore species with stand management scenarios provided insight to dead wood dynamics and polypore species management. In a managed stand, diversity thrived after final harvesting, but declined to low level by mid-rotation. Harvest residues and stumps, although low quality substrate for many species, were important for diversity in young managed stand due to their high quantities. High mixtures of naturalness in stand management were required to elevate diversity of managed spruce stands from the mid-rotation lows to levels in natural-like stands.
   Our study suggests that dead-wood supply of managed stands could be optimised to lift lowest species expectations towards levels in natural-like forests, but it seems that reaching these levels requires deadwood quantities much higher than provided by conventional management. Management of stand diversity can presumably be facilitated with wise landscape planning but more research is needed in order to incorporate polypores to spatio-temporal management simulation context.

AB  - By using microsatellite markers, we investigated the population genetic structure of three mainly clonally propagating bryophyte species-the hepatic Plagiochila asplenioides (L.) Dumort and the mosses Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst-that occupy habitats differing in the level of human disturbance. Sampled populations, located in southern Finland, were classified as natural or disturbed. All species possessed a fair amount of genetic variation both within populations (mean diversities per population of 0: 411 +/- 0: 118, 0: 403 +/- 0: 111, and 0: 307 +/- 0: 077, respectively) and across populations (0.599, 0.618, and 0.400, respectively). On average, natural and disturbed populations possessed similar levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation levels (F-ST values of 0.356, 0.298, and 0.302, respectively) were significant but showed that there is some gene flow taking place. The Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided additional information on the population genetic structures. Although R. squarrosus was the species with the lowest level of genetic variation, its populations inhabiting urban, disturbed habitats tended to contain highly differentiated genotypes of different origins, which suggests that human-mediated dispersal is important in urban habitats. In addition, detailed analyses of the spatial genetic structure of R. squarrosus showed that at short distances (1 to <30 m) individuals are more closely related than expected, while at greater distances (30 to 500 m) kinship decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the rarity of sexual reproduction was visible in the spatial genetic structure within R. squarrosus populations, as aggregations of similar genotypes were found at short distances in populations otherwise showing isolation-by-distance effect.

AB  - Evidence on habitat associations of threatened wood-inhabiting species in boreal forests may contribute to a better understanding of their ecology and conservation needs. We examined the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungal communities in an old-growth boreal forest with high substrate availability and continuity based on repeated surveys of fruit bodies. The number of species in morphological and functional groups in relation to coarse woody debris (CWD) attributes was estimated with generalized linear models. Additionally, we calculated species interaction networks of CWD attributes and fungal species. The composition of fungal communities was analysed using a non-metric multidimensional scaling with subsequent environmental fitting. Old conifer (especially spruce) logs and large aspen logs with branches represented the most important substrates for the red-listed species and the indicator species of old-growth boreal forests. Among dynamic CWD attributes such as time since tree death, decay class and stage of epixylic succession, the latter was the most important indicator of diversity of all species and their morphological and functional groups. The interaction network provided evidence of the importance of tree species diversity for fungal diversity. The composition of fungal communities was tree species specific and related to dynamic attributes, bark cover and diameter of logs. Our results suggest the importance of a continuum of dead wood from different tree species with a variety of niches such as branches, exposed wood, fragmented and complete cover of bark and patches of epixylic vegetation to maintain the assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi in an old-growth boreal forest.

AB  - Butterfly communities of field boundaries were studied in nine traditionally managed (grazed, mown) and eight intensively managed (ploughed, fertilised) farmland sites. Transect count data over 3 years (1997-1999) covered a total of 53 species and 5382 individuals. The butterfly fauna was rather similar under both management forms; species richness and relative abundance did not differ significantly between habitats, species diversity being higher in traditionally managed sites. In both habitats, the most abundant species were Aphantopus hyperantus, Thymelicus lineola and Pieris napi. Of 39 species observed in greater than or equal to3 sites, only Aglais urticae showed a significant preference for intensive management. The abundance of larval host plants and adult nectar plants were important factors for the occurrence of several butterfly species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Silver fir Abies alba Mill. represented a historically high proportion of the natural species com- position in Central Europe, but at present, due to forest management, game damage, climate change, and human activities, its share is extremely low. This paper aims to determine the abundance, species diversity, height structure, and especially the effect of competition level (1-4) and vegetation cover (mosses, herbs, ferns, grasses, Vaccinium, Rubus, tree litter) on the natural regeneration in a fenced forest stand with dominant fir in the tree layer. Research was conducted on 27 research plots in a lowland mixed forest (194 m a.s.l.) in the Rogow region of eastern Poland. Stand volume of the studied stand was 301 m3/ha at the age of 60 years, with a fir share of 75%. The abundance of natural regeneration reached 52,667 recruits/ha, 63% of which was fir. Fir represented 74% in the initial (height _0.5 m) regeneration, while it only composed 8% of the advanced regeneration (height 0.5 m). Comparing tree layers, a decrease in the share of fir and European beech Fagus sylvatica L. and an increase of European larch Larix decidua Mill. and Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. was observed in natural regeneration. Fir measured the lowest average height (24 cm) of all 15 occurring tree species (average height 43 cm). The mean height of natural regeneration was significantly positively correlated with vertical diversity. The tallest regeneration individuals were observed in the Rubus cover. The number of regenerations significantly (p<0.05) increased with vegetation cover and species richness. The highest density of fir was observed in the moss cover. The competition level had a significant (p<0.05) positive effect on the vertical and species diversity of natural regeneration, while its effect was negative on the proportion of fir. In terms of vegetation species, grasses had the largest effect on natural regeneration, while mosses had the lowest. Silver fir is very sensitive to silvicultural interven- tions, and it is necessary to support it with effective silviculture approaches during the ongoing climate change.

This study tested the time (0, 30, and 150 y) required for the development of vertical C-13 profiles in topsoil by comparing arable, afforested and continuously forested sites, and showed that three decades following afforestation of former cropland are sufficient to develop distinct C-13 depth profiles.

AB  - When dealing with stormwater runoff from urban areas it is today necessary to consider both quantity and quality aspects of the runoff. A new approach in this connection is to involve ecological processes in the drainage concept. In Malmo, in Sweden, the first facility of this kind was built in 1989, and has been followed by several more. It is very important that the design is adapted to local constraints and able to fulfil the targets for the recipients. To reach a successful result a close cooperation between different technical departments of the city is necessary.

AB  - We report on a structural complexity enhancement (SCE) experiment that was designed to test ecological restoration measures in the Black Forest National Park, Germany. The main goal was to understand as to whether the creation of standing and downed deadwood within previously managed, single-layered Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests accelerates the development of forest structure, richness, and diversity of a range of taxonomic groups. Here we introduce the experimental design and describe the development of stand structure including abundance and richness of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) within 5 years after initiation of the experiment in October 2016. To enhance structural complexity in treatment plots, 10 trees per plot were toppled using a skidder winch, and another 10 trees were ring barked at a height of around 60 cm above ground level with a chainsaw. To monitor stand structure, we collected data on common forest attributes such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and TreMs of all trees in the six experimental and six control plots measuring 0.25 ha in size before the treatments were carried out in 2016 and again in 2020/21. We analyzed the abundance and richness of TreMs using generalized linear mixed models with DBH and treatment vs. control as predictors. The SCE treatment resulted in a significant increase in deadwood volumes (4.2 vs. 439.5 m(3)) as well as in TreM abundance and richness (increase of 0.74 TreMs per tree). This indicates that the SCE treatment was effective to increase biodiversity-relevant structures such as deadwood and TreMs, in previously managed Norway spruce-dominated stands. The ongoing monitoring of a range of taxonomic groups (birds, bats, small mammals, coleoptera, fungi, mosses, and vascular plants) in this experiment will demonstrate to what extent the enhancement in structural complexity will lead to an enrichment in species richness and diversity.

AB  - Spatio-temporal gradients between ecosystems of the central Norwegian high mountains are analyzed. Complex landscape ecological site analyses combined with intensive pitfall trapping are carried out in four investigation areas in two regions. Key questions are addressed for the differences among ecosystems along a broad-scaled oceanic-continental gradient. The answers are based on ecological process analysis and mapping of zoocoenoses in small catchments of two alpine altitudinal belts. A comparison of four ridge sites is presented by analyzing water and temperature balance and activity of arthropods during the driest summer month. The results do not implicate summer drought and heat as limiting factors; summer wetness and cooling are most decisive. Landscape ecological processes, like the accumulation of snow during winter, snow melting, freeze-thaw action, percolation, soil moisture variation, and temperature regimes are exemplified by long-term measurements throughout the year in a small catchment in continental eastern Norway-the driest mountain region in Scandinavia. To team about the organization and diversity of zoocoenoses, epigeic arthropods (Araneae, Carabidae) are investigated along spatial gradients. Interrelations between distribution patterns of animals and spatio-temporal dynamics of the environmental conditions are presented. The results are framed by gradient theory in landscape ecology. Finally, the complexity of spatio-temporal gradient determination between ecosystems is discussed and summarized by a scheme of gradient principles for the Norwegian mountains.

AB  - The boreal biome is one of the largest in the world and its forests have been widely exploited for centuries. Consequently, large areas have suffered ecological simplification and loss of biodiversity. Under the current circumstances passive conservation measures are no longer enough and active restoration techniques need to be developed and assessed to preserve and recover the loss of biodiversity. We evaluated short- and long-term effects of two restoration methods aimed at mimicking natural disturbances on species richness, Shannon Diversity and community composition of vascular plants in the field layer and bryophytes in the ground layer. The experiment consisted of 18 forest stands in northern Sweden; each assigned to a different treatment: prescribed burning, gap cutting and untreated stands left as controls. A before-after control-impact (BACI) study design was applied and data was collected on three occasions: once prior to restoration (2010) and twice post restoration; one year (2012) and eight years after (2019). We analysed the differences in species richness and Shannon Diversity with linear mixed effect models and community composition changes with multivariate methods. Fire treatment caused an initial decline in diversity for both field and ground layer, but in the long-term, field layer surpassed the species richness and Shannon Diversity values found prior to restoration. Ground layer bryophytes species richness and Shannon Diversity remained lower than pre-treatment. Prescribed burning should, therefore, be used with caution in core areas for bryophyte diversity. Community composition in burned stands differed significantly between each time point as well as when compared to other treatments, for both layers. By contrast, we found no significant differences in diversity measures or community composition after gap cutting. The absence of effects from gap cutting suggests that minor changes in canopy cover does not affect the vegetation structure of forest stands. The organism group-specific responses, and temporal variability to restoration, highlight the importance of including more than one organism group, different restoration methodologies, and long-term studies in order to properly assess restoration outcomes at landscape level.

AB  - To explore the relationship between molluscan species diversity and selected environmental variables along a fjord gradient, we took 2 replicate samples with an epibenthic sledge at 10 localities along a transect from the Norwegian Trough to the inner parts of a fjord system. The Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') of 65 species decreased markedly from offshore to the innermost stations; there were fewer but more abundant species in the fjords than offshore. Diversity was positively correlated to sill depth, and negatively correlated to distance to 'species pool' (= recruitment area), C/N, and % carbon in the surface sediment. TWINSPAN, a numerical classification method, divided the mollusc fauna into 3 groups: (I) offshore, (II) outer fjord, and (III) inner fjord fauna. The relation between the faunal pattern and 15 environmental variables was analysed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The environmental variables that explained most of the variance between species in the CCA were sill depth, distance to 'species pool', C/N, % C, % loss on ignition, and median phi-size (phi), and together these variables accounted for 74 % of the variance in the species data. Four hypothetical explanations are offered as to why the diversity of the deep fjord fauna of molluscs and amphipods is low compared to adjacent offshore areas. The 2 most likely explanations are that the sediment habitat (i.e. food resources, measured as C/N, and grain size) may be more diverse offshore than in fjords, and that the higher influx of organic matter in fjords, measured as % carbon in the sediment, may favour the dominance of a few opportunistic species.

AB  - Data on vascular plants of boreal lakes in Finland were used to compare the efficiency of reserve selection methods in representing four aspects of biodiversity over a 63 year period. These aspects included species richness, phylogenetic diversity, restricted range diversity and threatened species. Our results show that the efficiency of reserve selection methods depends on the selection criteria used and on the aspect of biodiversity under consideration. Heuristic methods and optimizing algorithms were nearly equally efficient in selecting lake networks over a small geographical range. In addition, a scoring procedure was observed to be efficient in maintaining different aspects of biodiversity over time. However, the random selection of lakes seems to be the most inefficient option-for a reserve network. In general, reserve selection methods seem to favour lakes that maximize one aspect of diversity at the time of selection, but the network may not be the best option for maintaining the maximum diversity over time. The reserve selection methods do affect the long-term outcome but it is impossible to recommend one method over the others unequivocally.

AB  - Increasing environmental concerns with forestry have led to mounting interest in mixedwood management as a possible strategy to achieve a diversity of ecological and productivity goals within the context of sustainable forest management. This review focuses on the effects of mixedwoods on biodiversity including understory plants, birds, soil fauna, and ectomycorrhizae (ECM). It examines stand-level species diversity and composition but particularly focuses on the regional scale (gamma diversity) by examining evidence for the occurrence of mixedwood-indicator species. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) The existence of different tree species in the canopy is associated with provision of a greater diversity of microhabitats allowing for the addition of understory plant species associated with each canopy species. However, there is little evidence for the existence of understory plant species uniquely associated with mixedwoods. (ii) Some bird species require or prefer the presence of different tree species within a landscape or within a stand. Mixed forest stands and landscapes are thus critical to support populations of these species. (iii) A few studies showed a positive effect of mixed stands or mixed litters on some groups of soil organisms, but high variability makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about any potential benefits of mixedwoods for biodiversity of soil fauna. (iv) Some ECM taxa are associated with multiple hosts, and could thus benefit from availability of multiple possible host species found in mixed forest stands. Several studies confirmed that there was a greater abundance of multiple-host ECM taxa in mixedwoods.

AB  - Mixed mountain forests, primarily made up of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), cover about 10 x 10(6) ha of submontane-subalpine altitudes in Europe. They provide invaluable ecosystem services, e.g. protection against avalanches, landslides or rockfall. However, pure Norway spruce stands have, since mediaeval times, been heavily promoted as productive stand types for salt works at sites naturally supporting mixed mountain forests. Damage to these secondary pure spruce stands has been steadily increasing in recent decades. Furthermore, due to their previous limitation due to low temperatures and a short growing season, forest ecosystems in higher elevations are expected to be strongly affected by climate warming. To address these problems, alternative management concepts are being intensively discussed. A possible option to improve the stability and resilience of the stand is the transformation from pure Norway spruce stands into site-appropriate, sustainable and stable mixed mountain forests. In this study, we have tested seven different transformation scenarios (e.g. slit, shelterwood and gap-coupes, strip clear-cutting, do-nothing) and their impact on five evaluation criteria (forest growth, economics, carbon sequestration, (stand) stability and biodiversity). As there are hardly any practical examples for some of the transformation scenarios available, we have used the forest growth simulator SILVA to assess whether the tested transformation scenarios differ in transformation success and to observe trade-offs between the criteria of evaluation. Of the investigated scenarios, we consider the ones with gap or slit-coupes with the most beneficial overall utility values for the portfolio of the five evaluation criteria. However, we showed with our results that it is possible, by means of several trajectories, to return destabilised forests to sustainable and stable systems. We showed that a transformation is realistic, even if sophisticated silvicultural concepts are not strictly pursued.

AB  - Due to limited nearshore areas and great impact to local ecosystems, the aquaculture industry is moving the fish farms into more exposed sea regions where the environmental conditions are much more severe. Like other offshore installations operating at sea, fish cages are also exposed to the risk of collisions from attendant or visiting vessels. This paper evaluates the structural strength of the world's first offshore fish farm operating in Norway subjected to supply vessel collisions by the use of nonlinear finite element simulations. The fish cage is a semi-submersible floating structure consisting of ring-stiffened columns connected by braces. A standard 7500-ton supply vessel is used as the striking vessel. Both local shell deformation analysis using LS-DYNA and beam deformation analysis using USFOS are carried out. In the local shell analysis, collision scenarios with both decoupled and coupled methods are simulated for several representative impact locations. The decoupled model adopts prescribed paths for ship motions, while in the coupled model, the ship motions are calculated based on hydrodynamic forces from linear potential theory as well as inertia and collision forces. In the global beamcolumn analysis in USFOS, the force-deformation curves of the supply vessel from local shell analysis are used as the input. The resulting damage and energy absorption are compared with those from local shell simulations. The results are discussed with respect to the impact resistance, energy absorption and structural damage.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are important natural carbon sinks but their efficiency varies greatly depending on species composition and environmental conditions. What causes this variation is not fully known and could have important implications for management and protection of the seagrass habitat to continue to act as a natural carbon sink. Here, we assessed sedimentary organic carbon in Zostera marina meadows (and adjacent unvegetated sediment) in four distinct areas of Europe (Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish Skagerrak coast, Asko in the Baltic Sea, Sozopol in the Black Sea and Ria Formosa in southern Portugal) down to similar to 35 cm depth. We also tested how sedimentary organic carbon in Z. marina meadows relates to different sediment characteristics, a range of seagrass-associated variables and water depth. The seagrass carbon storage varied greatly among areas, with an average organic carbon content ranging from 2.79 +/- 0.50% in the Gullmar Fjord to 0.17 +/- 0.02% in the area of Sozopol. We found that a high proportion of fine grain size, high porosity and low density of the sediment is strongly related to high carbon content in Z. marina sediment. We suggest that sediment properties should be included as an important factor when evaluating high priority areas in management of Z. marina generated carbon sinks.

AB  - Knowledge of past. re regimes is crucial for understanding the changes in. re frequency that are likely to occur during the coming decades as a result of global warming and land-use change. This is a key issue for the sustainable management of forest biodiversity because. re regimes may be controlled by vegetation, human activities, and/or climate. The present paper aims to reconstruct the pattern of. re frequency over the Holocene at three sites located in the same region in the northern Swedish boreal forest. The. re regime is reconstructed from sedimentary charcoal analysis of small lakes or ponds. This method allows. re events to be characterized, after detrending the charcoal influx series, and allows estimation of the time elapsed between. res. The long-term. re regime, in terms of fire-free intervals, can thus be elucidated. At the three sites, the mean fire-free intervals through the Holocene were long and of similar magnitude (similar to 320 years). This similarity suggests that the ecological processes controlling. re ignition and spread were the same. At the three sites, the intervals were shorter before 8600 cal yr BP ( calibrated years before present), between 7500 and 4500 cal yr BP, and after 2500 cal yr BP. Geomorphological and vegetation factors cannot explain the observed change, because the three sites are located in the same large ecological region characterized by Pinus sylvestris-Ericaceae mesic forests, established on morainic deposits at the same elevation. Archaeological chronologies also do not match the. re chronologies. A climatic interpretation is therefore the most likely explanation of the long-term regional pattern of. re. Although recent human activities between the 18th and the 20th centuries have clearly affected the. re regime, the dominant factor controlling it for 10 000 years in northern Sweden has probably been climatic.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess how the expansion of Calamagrostis epigejos influences the species composition and diversity of forest, clearing, and meadow communities as well as how habitat factors influence biometric variability and features determining the potential of Calamagrostis epigejos for expansion in the studied communities. The study was conducted in the central part of the Sudetes Mountains (SW Poland). Four types of communities with C. epigejos occurrence were chosen: a beech forest (Luzulo luzuloidis-Fagetum), a Norway spruce monoculture, a clearing community belonging to the Epilobietea angustifolii class, and a mesic mountain meadow of the Arrhenatheretalia order. In each of the studied communities, randomized selection of 10 plots (1 x 1 m) was performed. On these plots releves were sampled, a biometric study was conducted, and soil samples were collected. The research revealed a significant influence of C. epigejos expansion on the species composition, diversity, and productivity in the herb layers of the studied communities. It also indicated a strong positive influence of sunlight availability and studied physicochemical properties of soil on the expansion ability of C. epigejos.

AB  - To increase the overall faunistic knowledge of Swedish Clitellata, a survey was performed in Nationalstadsparken, a mosaic of fresh and brackish waters, parklands alternating with remnants of natural biota, and areas of urban development, within the cities of Stockholm and Solna on the Baltic coast of Sweden (59 degrees N, 18 degrees E). One hundred and twenty-one species (113 Oligochaeta, 8 Hirudinea) were collected at 31 aquatic and 27 terrestrial or littoral localities; 49 species of Oligochaeta were found at the aquatic localities, 70 species at the terrestrial/littoral sites. Twenty-four species are new records for Sweden, and this urban national park thus features 64% of all non-marine clitellates known from the country. The result is consistent with a view that diversity is enhanced when human activities increase habitat complexity, even in areas in direct contact with a large city.

AB  - Forests and forest industries can contribute to climate change mitigation by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, by storing it in biomass, and by fabricating products that substitute more greenhouse gas emission intensive materials and energy. The objectives of the study are to specify alternative scenarios for the diversification of wood product markets and to determine how an increasingly diversified market structure could impact the net carbon emissions (NCEs) of forestry in Finland. The NCEs of the Finnish forest sector were modelled for the period 2016-2056 by using a forest management simulation and optimization model for the standing forests and soil and separate models for product carbon storage and substitution impacts. The annual harvest was fixed at approximately 70 Mm(3), which was close to the level of roundwood removals for industry and energy in 2016. The results show that the substitution benefits for a reference scenario with the 2016 market structure account for 9.6 Mt C (35.2 Mt CO2 equivalent [CO2 eq]) in 2056, which could be further increased by 7.1 Mt C (26 Mt CO2 eq) by altering the market structure. As a key outcome, increasing the use of by-products for textiles and wood-plastic composites in place of kraft pulp and biofuel implies greater overall substitution credits compared to increasing the level of log harvest for construction.

AB  - In Sweden, the majority of forest area has been altered by industrial forestry over the decades. Almost 30 years ago, a shift towards biodiversity-oriented forest management practices occurred. Here we took advantage of long-term data collected by the Swedish National Forest Inventory to track developmental changes in forest structural components over this time. We assessed changes in structural components that play an important role in biodiversity (dead wood, large living trees, tree species composition, and understory vegetation) in four forest types with descending tiers of biodiversity protection: protected areas, woodland key habitats, low-productivity forests and production forests. Overall, we found a positive trend in the volumes of dead wood and large living trees, as well as in tree species diversity, while there was a general decline in understory vegetation coverage. Most observed changes were consistent with the intended outcomes of the current forest policy, adapted in the early 1990s. The implementation of retention forestry is likely driving some of the observed changes in forest structural components in the south. In contrast, we observed no changes in any of the focal structural components in the north, which could be attributed to the ongoing clear-cutting of forests previously managed less intensively. Dead wood and large living trees increased not only in managed, but also in unmanaged forests, likely reflecting historical management. The increased tree species diversity can be explained through current forest management practices that encourages maintenance of additional tree species. Decreasing understory vegetation coverage in both dense managed and unmanaged forests suggests that factors other than forestry contribute to the ongoing changes in understory vegetation in Swedish forests. Overall, the observed increase in structural components has not yet been reflected in documented improvements for red-listed forest species, which may be due to delays in species responses to small improvements, as well as a lack of detailed monitoring. Similarly, the increased availability of forest structural components might still be insufficient to meet the specific habitat requirements of red-listed species.

AB  - Forest scenario analysis can help tackle sustainability issues by generating insight into the potential long-term effects of present-day management. In northern Sweden, forests provide important benefits including climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, reindeer husbandry, local livelihoods, and recreation. Informed by local stakeholders' views on how forests can be enabled to deliver these benefits, we created four forest management scenarios: the close-to-nature scenario (CTN) which emphasises biodiversity conservation, the classic management scenario (CLA) optimising the forests' net present value, the intensified scenario (INT) maximising harvested wood from the forest, and the combined scenario (COM) applying a combination of measures from the CTN and INT. The scenarios were applied to the local forest landscape and modelled over a 100-year simulation period, and the results of the modelling were then evaluated by a diverse group of stakeholders. For most ecosystem services, there was a time lag of 10-50 years before noticeable effects and differences between the scenarios became evident, highlighting the need to consider both the short- and long-term effects of forest management. Evaluation by the stakeholders put the modelled results into a local context. They raised considerations relating to wildlife and hunting, climate change risks, social acceptability, and conflict, highlighting the value of evaluating the scenarios qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Overall, stakeholders thought that the CTN and CLA scenarios promoted more ecosystem services and posed fewer climate risks, while also creating less conflict among stakeholders. Our results emphasise the value of combining scientific and local knowledge when developing and evaluating future forest scenarios.

AB  - The quantity and distribution of carbon (C) storage in old-growth forests is a fundamental parameter needed to more accurately predict management effects on landscape C. C accounting on a regional or national level is generally based on zonal ecosystems, but total ecosystem C can vary widely with soil productive capacity within landscapes. To illustrate this, I compared old-growth forests of contrasting plant associations reflecting typical soil productivity gradients of the southern boreal forest in British Columbia, Canada. Total ecosystem C of zonal sites (medium-Huckleberry plant association) averaged 309 Mg C.ha(-1), while less and more productive forest types ranged from 120 to 725 Mg C.ha(-1), respectively. On average, 62% of ecosystem C was in live trees, 20% in mineral soils (0-50 cm), 9% in forest floors, and 9% in coarse woody debris and snags. Positive linear correlations between total ecosystem C and soil nitrogen availability or asymptotic stand height confirmed the strong influence of site productive capacity on C storage. The results demonstrate how ecological site classification or direct measures of stand productivity could refine estimates of the upper limits in potential C storage.

AB  - Degradation of ecosystems is a great concern on the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecological restoration fights degradation aiming at the recovery of ecosystem functions such as carbon (C) sequestration and ecosystem structures like plant communities responsible for the C sequestration function. We selected 38 pristine, drained and restored boreal peatland sites in Finland and asked i) what is the long-term effect of drainage on the peatland surface layer C storage, ii) can restoration recover ecosystem functioning (surface layer growth) and structure (plant community composition) and iii) is the recovery of the original structure needed for the recovery of ecosystem functions? We found that drainage had resulted in a substantial net loss of C from surface layer of drained sites. Restoration was successful in regaining natural growth rate in the peatland surface layer already within 5 years after restoration. However, the regenerated surface layer sequestered C at a mean rate of 116.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 12.7), when a comparable short-term rate was 178.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 13.3) at the pristine sites. The plant community compositions of the restored sites were considerably dissimilar to those of pristine sites still 10 years after restoration. We conclude that ecological restoration can be used to jump-start some key peatland ecosystem functions even without the recovery of original ecosystem structure (plant community composition). However, the re-establishment of other functions like C sequestration may require more profound recovery of conditions and ecosystem structure. We discuss the potential economic value of restored peatland ecosystems from the perspective of their C sequestration function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat specificity analysis provides a tool for partitioning landscape species diversity on landscape elements by separating patches with many rare specialist species from patches with the same number of species, all of which are common generalists and thus provide information of relevance to conservation goals at regional and national levels. Our analyses were based upon species data from 2201 patch elements in SE Norwegian modern agricultural landscapes. The context used for measuring habitat specificity strongly influences the results. In general the gamma diversity contribution and core habitat specificity calculated from the patch data set were correlated. High values for both measures were observed for woodland, pastures and road verges whereas midfield islets and boundary transitional types were ranked low, as opposed to findings in traditional, extensively managed agricultural landscapes. This is due to our study area representing intensively used agricultural landscape elements holding a more trivial species composition, in addition to ruderals being favoured by fertility and disturbance, a finding also being supported by the semi-natural affiliation index. Results obtained by use of checklist data from the same study area diverged from patch data. Caution is needed in interpretation of habitat specificity results obtained from checklist data, because modern agricultural landscapes contain several land types which are seldom surveyed by botanists, thus being under-represented in the data set. We propose the use of core habitat specificity and gamma diversity contribution in parallel to obtain a value neutral diversity assessment that addresses patch uniqueness and other properties of conservation interests.

AB  - A growing trend of interest for the cultivation of kelp is driven by predictions for high global demands of important commodities, which require the development of alternative supplies of natural resources. In this study the dynamics of loss of biomass from cultivated Saccharina latissima were studied from February to August 2018 at two kelp farms in Northern (69 degrees 45.26 ' N/019 degrees 02.18 ' E) and in Mid-Norway (63 degrees 42.28 ' N/08 degrees 52.23 ' E). Kelp fronds at each farm were individually followed throughout the growing season. Sectional regression was applied for conversion of measured frond lengths to estimated dry weights. The study shows that between 40 and 100% of all individuals in the studied kelp population constantly eroded slightly from their distal ends. However, until June the accumulated loss was only 8% of produced dry weight. Due to dislodgement of whole sporophytes this picture changed in July and August to heavy losses in Mid-Norway. Thus, the overall losses of kelp in terms of accumulated dry weight were only 8-13% of the gross growth until harvest in June in Mid-Norway and August in Northern Norway. Losses increased significantly in Mid-Norway during July and reached 49.4% of the annual production in August. The rates of losses were separated into specific erosion and dislodgement rates. Erosion rates over the whole experimental period for the two sites were not significantly different, while differences in dislodgement rates between farm sites proved to be highly significant. The exported annual amount of carbon was estimated on the basis of lost and measured carbon content in the tissue. From these data a scenario was built for a commercial Norwegian kelp farm growing S. latissima showing a carbon export of 63-88 g C m(-2)y(-1). This is eight times less than has been reported from scenarios for kelp farms in China. This study confirms that optimal timing of harvest is the most important management tool for avoidance of heavy losses from kelp farms. In conclusion, an industry with early harvest will likely have a low carbon export, while a late-harvested bulk production could export four to six times as much carbon with an increased potential for carbon sequestration.

AB  - The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.,(SKB.), pursues site investigations for the final repository for spent nuclear fuel at two sites in the south eastern part of Sweden, the Forsmark- and the Laxemar site (figure 1). Data from the two site investigations are used to build site descriptive models of the areas. These models describe the bedrock and surface system properties important for designing the repository, the environmental impact assessment, and the long-term safety, i.e. up to 100,000 years, in a safety assessment. In this paper we discuss the methodology, and the interim results for, the landscape model, used in the safety assessment to populate the Forsmark site in the numerical dose models. The landscape model is built upon ecosystem types, e.g. a lake or a mire, (Biosphere Objects) that are connected in the landscape via surface hydrology. Each of the objects have a unique set of properties derived from the site description. The objects are identified by flow transport modeling, giving discharge points at the surface for all possible flow paths from the hypothetical repository in the bedrock. The landscape development is followed through time by using long-term processes e.g. shoreline displacement and sedimentation. The final landscape model consists of a number of maps for each chosen time period and a table of properties that describe the individual objects which constitutes the landscape. The results show a landscape that change over time during 20,000 years. The time period used in the model equals the present interglacial and can be used as an analogue for a future interglacial. Historically, the model area was covered by sea, and then gradually changes into a coastal area and, in the future, into a terrestrial inland landscape. Different ecosystem types are present during the landscape development, e.g. sea, lakes, agricultural areas, forest and wetlands (mire). The biosphere objects may switch from one ecosystem type to another during the modeled time period, from sea to lake, and from lake to mire and finally, some objects are transformed into agricultural area due to favorable farming characteristics.

AB  - Background Species-specific genotypic features, local neighbourhood interactions and resource supply strongly influence the tree stature and growth rate. In mixed-species forests, diversity-mediated biomass allocation has been suggested to be a fundamental mechanism underlying the positive biodiversity-productivity relationships. Empirical evidence, however, is rare about the impact of local neighbourhood diversity on tree characteristics analysed at a very high level of detail. To address this issue we analysed these effects on the individual-tree crown architecture and tree productivity in a mature mixed forest in northern Germany. Methods Our analysis considers multiple target tree species across a local neighbourhood species richness gradient ranging from 1 to 4. We applied terrestrial laser scanning to quantify a large number of individual mature trees (N = 920) at very high accuracy. We evaluated two different neighbour inclusion approaches by analysing both a fixed radius selection procedure and a selection based on overlapping crowns. Results and conclusions We show that local neighbourhood species diversity significantly increases crown dimension and wood volume of target trees. Moreover, we found a size-dependency of diversity effects on tree productivity (basal area and wood volume increment) with positive effects for large-sized trees (diameter at breast height (DBH) > 40 cm) and negative effects for small-sized (DBH < 40 cm) trees. In our analysis, the neighbour inclusion approach has a significant impact on the outcome. For scientific studies and the validation of growth models we recommend a neighbour selection by overlapping crowns, because this seems to be the relevant scale at which local neighbourhood interactions occur. Because local neighbourhood diversity promotes individual-tree productivity in mature European mixed-species forests, we conclude that a small-scale species mixture should be considered in management plans.

AB  - Despite the widespread recognition of the risks of disease transmission associated with international trade in domestic animals and movement of exotic animals, less is known about the role of rats in carrying pathogens between continents. The genus Bartonella, a highly prevalent and extremely diverse group of bacteria, includes species that are excellent sentinel organisms for evaluating the transoceanic and intra-continental movement of the pathogens carried by rats of the genus Rattus. The patterns of spatial distribution, occurrence, and genetic diversity of Bartonella species infecting rats and their arthropod ectoparasites depend on the geographic locations within metropolitan areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. One of the points addressed in this review is a comparison of the diversity of Bartonella species carried by rats in their original habitats in Southeast Asia and in the cities occupied by rats recently. The invasion of Rattus rats into new urban territories create significant risk for human health.

AB  - Turkey has a diverse apple germplasm and Northeastern Anatolia had great contributions to domestication of the Malus genus. Despite quite high rainfall (900-2300 mm) and humidity (70-85%) levels, several local apple cultivars have been successfully grown for centuries at the coastal zone of Eastern Black Sea region of Northeastern Anatolia without any pesticide applications. In this study, a set of 206 local genotypes, including 6 international cultivars as references was analyzed using 13 SSR primers with the aim of assessing the genetic diversity and population structure among the genotypes. Bayesian genetic structure analysis was used to reveal differentiation of the groups and the results were confirmed by factorial correspondence analysis (FCA). A total of 234 alleles (average 18) were generated by 13 SSR markers. CH02c06 was the most informative (PI: 0.017) and CH03g07 was the least informative (PI: 0.07) locus. The average He was 0.859 with a range of 0.775-0.929 and the average Ho was 0.760 with a range of 0.556-0.872. Considerable genetic variation was detected among the genotypes and genetic similarity varied between 11 and 96%. A Bayesian genetic structure analysis indicated three subpopulations (K) and admixture among the accessions. Several loci yielded three alleles in 39 accessions. No synonyms or identical cultivars were detected but several genotypes known by the same names formed 22 homonym groups. The present SSR data will have great contributions to future germplasm management efforts as well as to further comparative studies that investigate genetic relationships among the local apples of Northeastern Anatolia.

AB  - Introduction of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) as one of the historically important coniferous tree species in Central Europe into allochthonous cultivated forests is an important task for contemporary and future generations of foresters. The aim of our work was to optimize the management of fir in allochthonous cultivated stands of National Park Ceske Svycarsko formed mainly by Norway spruce (Picea abies /L./Karst.). The effects of light and soil conditions and game on the survival and growth of fir plantations were investigated. Browsing was determined as the limiting factor for fir reintroduction. Assessing the significance of edaphic conditions for the height increment of fir, favourable effect of luvisol could be demonstrated as compared to acidic soil. Canopy openness maximum of 30% and stand basal area of 30 to 43(m2)/ha with relative direct radiation of up to 45% and relative indirect radiation of up to 55% with prevalence of the diffuse component create optimal environmental conditions for the survival and sustainable growth of fir plantations in the spruce stand in regeneration.

AB  - Understanding the distribution of specific diversity is currently an important focus in marine research, and the role of marine biodiversity has been fully recognised as essential for the proper functioning of the biosphere. The objective of this study was to explain the distribution of macrobenthic taxonomic richness (vagile epifauna, endofauna and sessile epifauna) in the eastern part of the English Channel using both classical methods and applying the mid-domain effect (MDE) model. High diversity was encountered in the eastern English Channel (875 taxa), with high-diversity areas often comprising gravelly or pebbly sediments. Sessile epifauna represented 25% of this inventory, revealing the importance of this group. Our results underline the existence of randomness in the observed species richness distribution due to large number of species with restricted ranges.

AB  - Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) is increasingly argued as an alternative to clear-cut harvesting in managed boreal forests to improve water quality and quantity, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. We review the empirical evidence for the potential benefits of CCF on drained forested peatlands in boreal ecosystems as an alternative to conventional clear-cut harvesting. We also discuss possible risks and uncertainties that need further consideration and highlight unanswered questions that need to be resolved before large-scale implementation. In general, we found that the ability to maintain forest production on drained forested peatlands pri-marily depends on water regulation of the groundwater (GW) table. Currently, the problem with high GW is typically solved using ditch cleaning, but if CCF is adopted, it could be an alternative approach to manage GW without the need of disturbing this already extensive artificial channel network. Implementation of CCF could lower the risk of extreme flooding and droughts, in addition to maintaining water quality and potentially enhancing the carbon sequestration conditions. Furthermore, it could provide a compromise between industrialized forestry and peatland restoration to better meet these targets. However, several important uncertainties remain regarding the potential for natural regeneration in northern latitudes, the net effect of different types of soil damage due to repeated use of heavy machinery, and consequences of climate change that could result in enhanced storm felling. We primarily focus on Swedish conditions, but also evaluate implications in an international context and propose ways to close remaining knowledge gaps.

AB  - Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than elsewhere, and is predicted to have a large impact on biodiversity, since entire cold-adapted ecosystems are likely to disappear. Here, we highlight changes in the insect species richness and community composition of wild bees, butterflies and moths over 60 years in an area situated above the tree limit (Padjelanta National Park) in northern Sweden. Although there were changes in habitat availability, indicated by a significant decrease in the area of a glacier (from 22 km(2) in 1898 to 7.5 km(2) in 2009), and an increase in the area of birch forest in the National Park, we nevertheless found relatively moderate changes in the insect communities. Indeed, the observed number of species increased from 52 in 1944 to 64 in 2008. Remarkably, the mean number of butterflies and moths per site, but not wild bee species, increased significantly. Among the species that were recorded in both periods, the average altitude of 17 species had shifted downhill, 12 shifted uphill, and the altitude of the remaining 17 had not changed. While alterations in community composition were greater at the highest altitudes, changes in the insect community were smaller than expected, indeed much smaller than those reported from agricultural landscapes in North-West Europe. Interestingly, our results suggest that lower alpine altitudes (600-800 m a.s.l.) have become colonized by southern species, but also that high alpine areas (above 1,000 m a.s.l.) have recently become colonized by high alpine species previously absent from these sites, likely as a result of increasing habitat availability. We conclude that wild bee, butterfly, and moth communities in Arctic areas in northern Sweden are in flux, as a result of climate change and suggest that increased attention must be given to conservation planning in cold areas. In addition, we propose that monitoring programs should be established, because more pronounced climate-driven changes can be expected in the future.

AB  - Understanding interactions between complex human and natural systems involved in urban carbon cycling is important when balancing the dual goals of urban development to accommodate a growing population, while also achieving urban carbon neutrality. This study develops a systems breakdown accounting method to assess the urban carbon cycle. The method facilitates greater understanding of the complex interactions within and between systems involved in this cycle, in order to identify ways in which humans can adapt their interactions to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from urban regions. Testing the systems breakdown accounting method in Stockholm County, Sweden, we find that it provides new insights into the carbon interactions with urban green-blue areas in the region. Results show how Stockholm County can reduce its emissions and achieve its goal of local carbon net-neutrality, if the green areas protect its carbon sequestration potential and maintain it to offset projected remaining active emissions. Results also show that the inland surface waters and inner archipelago waters within Stockholm County are a considerable source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. A better understanding of these water emissions is necessary to formulate effective planning and policy measures that can reduce urban emissions. The insights gained from this study can also be applied in other regions. In particular, water bodies could play a significant role in the urban carbon cycle and using this knowledge for more complete carbon accounting, and a better understanding of green-blue interactions could help to reduce net urban emissions in many places.

AB  - Conservation contracting has attained growing interest worldwide as a tool for protecting biodiversity in privately owned lands. In this policy, landowners receive payments from an environmental agency in exchange for land use practices that contribute to the supply of biodiversity. This approach may result in a conservation network which does not cover all focal ecological characteristics, because landowners determine the supply of potential targets. In addition, the contracts are typically allocated by using a scoring method that is not giving information on the representativeness of the species composition of the sites. In this study, we investigated what is the performance of a voluntary conservation program in selecting sites that would maximize the number of specific target species in the selected conservation network subject to a given budget constraint. We focused on the Finnish pilot program named Trading in Natural Values (TNV). Our data consisted of 56 mature stands covering both stands that were offered to the TNV program and stands that were not offered. All the stands were surveyed for specific groups of wood-inhabiting fungi and epiphytic lichens that can be considered as good surrogates for forest species diversity.
   Our results showed that the participation in the TNV program was large enough to meet the ecological goals, because the offered targets uncovered only two of the 73 surveyed species. and the cost-effective conservation network included only a few targets that were not offered in the pilot program. However, the contract allocation method used in the TNV could be improved, because many ecologically valuable targets that were offered to the program were not accepted. In general, it could be justified to survey some indicator species, which would be relatively easy to identify, to maximize species coverage in contract allocation. Surveying indicator species causes some extra costs, but these are likely to be minor compared with the costs savings in opportunity costs, due to the improved targeting of protected areas.

AB  - Conflicts over conservation are often regarded as dichotomies of diametrical opposites. When national parks are established in Norway, two stereotypes can be sketched: (1) the ecocentric position valuing 'pure, authentic nature', relying on the national government as the only acceptable decision and management level; and (2) a more anthropocentric position valuing cultural landscape elements and certain traditional and future uses of the area, favouring local management. A conflict over restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised comprehensive local debate. It is asked whether the relevant actors should be seen as situated in the stereotypes, or whether a more complex three-dimensional picture would provide a better interpretation.

AB  - Roads severely affect the health of ecosystems across the globe by fragmenting and diminishing habitats, reducing population connectivity, and increasing animal mortality. Wildlife underpasses allow for increased road permeability-the ability for animals to safely cross the road. Despite growing success in other regions, little is known about underpass usage in Central America. In this study, I monitored two dry circular culverts and two unfenced tunnels with barbed wire partially blocking their entrances on Route 606 in Guacimal, Costa Rica, from 14 November to 6 December 2021 using 15 camera traps to assess which species used them to cross. Twelve species used the culverts and tunnels for a total of 108 individual crossings. The tunnels were used, in descending order, by agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), dog (Canis familiaris), nine-banded armadillo (Dasyous novemcinctus), cat (Felis catus), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), squirrel (Sciurus variegatoides), northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana), and coati (Nasua narica). The circular tunnel, Tunnel 1, was used more frequently and by a greater diversity of species than observed in the square tunnel, Tunnel 2. The two smaller culverts were used by common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), cat (Felis catus), rat opossum (Micoureus alstoni), and Watson's climbing rat (Tylomus watsoni). Culvert 2 was used more frequently; however, Culvert 1 was used by a greater diversity of species. This study highlights wildlife underpasses as a critical strategy for biological conservation in Costa Rica through improved road safety and habitat connectivity.

AB  - 1. This paper examines long-term changes in the structure and composition of the groundfish species assemblage in three regions of the north-western North Sea. Scottish fisheries research vessel data collected during the months July-September over the period 1929-53 are compared with more recent August groundfish survey data covering the period 1980-93. Trends in the whole groundfish assemblage, and in a subset of the assemblage that is not targeted by commercial fisheries, are described.
   2. Long-term differences in species assemblage were subtle, and were most apparent in the dominance structure. Species diversity in the whole groundfish assemblage was marginally greater in the period 1929-53, but no difference was apparent within the non-target species assemblage. For the whole groundfish assemblage, diversity was greatest in the inshore region and least in the offshore area, but there was no obvious spatial gradient for the non-target species assemblage.
   3. Multivariate analyses indicated long-term changes and between-area differences in the species composition for both the whole groundfish assemblage and the non-target species subset. More detailed examination of the data revealed that the long-term changes resulted from relatively small and subtle differences in the relative abundance of rarer species, such as grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) and spur-dog Squalus acanthius L.. In contrast, changes in the relative abundance of the more common species, such as Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson) and whiting Merlangius merlangus (L.), explained much of the between-area variation.
   4. Examination of species aggregated length-frequency distributions suggested that by the 1980s there had been a shift towards assemblages in which smaller fish were more highly represented. This was only apparent, however, in the whole groundfish species assemblage; the length-frequency distributions of non-targeted species were almost identical in the two time periods.
   5. Overall, the results suggest that, although differences in the structure of the whole fish assemblage can be detected, the non-target groundfish assemblage appears to have remained relatively unchanged, despite a century of intensive fishing activity.

AB  - To effectively integrate nature conservation into sustainable landscape management, it is essential to deepen the understanding of why, what, where and for whom nature is protected. This is especially important for nature conservation in human dominated landscapes such as cities, where built up and protected areas are moving closer to each other due to worldwide urbanization. In this study we analyzed historical and current data in Sweden to examine how decision makers have used the nature conservation objectives stated by law to establish urban and rural nature protected areas respectively. The focal conservation objectives are the preservation of biodiversity (species and habitats), outdoor recreation and restoration of environments. How these objectives were used was analyzed for all 1869 nature reserves in southern Sweden in relation to degree of urbanization in the landscape. We found that nature reserves in more urbanized landscapes were based on a higher number of objectives and had a different composition of objectives compared to rural reserves. The objectives "outdoor recreation" and "species biodiversity preservation" were more common in urban reserves, while preservation of habitats were more common in rural. From the last decades we found indications of a shift in use of objectives in urban areas, going from outdoor recreation to a stronger focus on species diversity conservation. National and global trends in the nature conservation debate were also reflected in the use of objectives over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The species richness of the scuttle fly (Diptera: Phoridae) genus Megaselia was estimated by various non-parametric estimators from EstimateS, Species Prediction And Diversity Estimation (SPADE) and Ws2m, based on material from a Swedish hemiboreal forest area recently affected by major wildfires, Tyresta National Park and Nature Reserve (TNPNR), south of Stockholm. A total of 21 249 individuals were collected in Malaise traps, of which males constituted 16 976 and females 4 273. The analysed dataset represents 37 samples containing 18 549 specimens sorted into 330 species (184 described, 146 are either undescribed or of unsettled taxonomic status). It was not possible to estimate the total species richness using all samples due to heterogeneity caused by inclusion of different communities and temporal incoherencies between samples within and between years. Even with material obtained from a sampling program that was not designed for species richness estimates, it was possible to obtain reliable results when sample heterogeneity was minimized. By dividing the data into community-specific datasets - for bog, forest and wildfire - it was possible to obtain asymptotic curves for the smaller of the two wildfire datasets. A total estimate of 357-439 (95% CI) was attained by using the smaller wildfire dataset and adding the 85 unique species from the samples not included in the estimation analysis. TNPNR has one of the richest known scuttle fly communities in Europe, consisting of almost 50% of the currently named Megaselia species; 48 of these species are reported as new records for Sweden in this study.

AB  - The conservation of habitats and ecosystems is widely regarded as the most efficient way to maintain biodiversity. Protected areas are, however, under the continuous influence of natural dynamics that may affect their structure and functioning. In boreal forests, succession in protected forests may change their ecological properties, including tree species composition. European aspen (Populus tremula) hosts high species richness but appears to recruit slowly in old-growth forests. We explored the long-term dynamics of aspen in a network of forest reserves through two full-coverage inventories in 15 forest reserves in Finland, 18 years apart. We found a decline of 37% in the number of living aspen (diameter at breast height >= 5 cm) between the two inventories, from an average of 8 trees/ha to 5 trees/ha. The size distribution of living aspen shifted towards a greater proportion of large trees >= 35 cm in diameter. In addition, the rate of recruitment was low, despite a large number of saplings. Most of the observed recruitment took place along the old-growth forest edges, whereas saplings were abundantly present in all parts of the forest in conjunction with living aspen, which function as parent trees for vegetative reproduction. We also observed that browsing on aspen saplings by herbivores was greater at the forest edges and was reduced towards the forest interior. The observed decline in aspen, together with a low recruitment rate, seems to reduce the capability of these protected areas to maintain their biodiversity levels. However, and contrary to several previous suggestions, ecological processes near forest edges may mimic the natural disturbances needed to facilitate aspen recruitment.

AB  - In the 1950s, a long-term experiment was initiated at three locations in Northern Sweden. The treatments included four cropping systems, which differed in the number of years with leys or annual crops in the crop rotation. To create awareness of the experiment as a research resource for further scientific studies, we summarise the history (experimental design, materials and methods, main measurements) and scientific findings of the experiment, as well as reflect on its usefulness and opportunities for further studies. So far, scientific focus has been on the effects of cropping systems on soil characteristics. The main findings indicate that soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity were greater in cropping systems with a large proportion of ley, soil bulk density showed the opposite trend. In terms of chemical properties, cropping systems incorporating more ley also have greater soil organic carbon content than annual crops systems, and both soil carbon and N storage decrease over time in cropping systems with only annual crops. The effects of cropping system on crop yields and quality are areas for further investigation.

AB  - Background Fires have been an important natural disturbance and pervasive evolutionary force in the boreal biome. Yet, fire suppression has made forest fires rare in the managed landscapes in Fennoscandia, causing significant habitat loss for saproxylic species such as polypores and insects. To better understand how the beetle community changes (species turnover) after a wildfire in a landscape with intense fire suppression, we monitored beetles with flight intercept traps the first 3 years as well as 12 years after a large wildfire in a national park in northern Sweden (a control/unburnt area was set up for the last year of sampling). Results Species composition changed significantly among all studied years with a continuous turnover of species following the wildfire. The indicator species analysis showed that year 1 post-fire was mostly associated with cambium consumers and also the pyrophilous speciesBatrisodes hubenthali. Year 2 was the most abundant and species-rich year, withTomicus piniperdaas the most important indicator species. The indicator species year 3 were mostly secondary successional species, fungivores, and predators and were characterized by lower species diversity. Year 12 had higher diversity compared with year 3 but lower species richness and abundance. A control area was established during year 12 post-fire, and our analyses showed that the control area and burned area differed in species composition suggesting that the beetle community needs longer than 12 years to recover even after a low-intensive ground fire. Conclusion The wildfire area hosted several red-listed and fire-dependent species suggesting that after a century of landscape-level fire suppression in a semi-natural area, the reintroduction of fire benefits rare and pyrophilous species and still impacts species composition after 12 years. This study implies that fire has long-lasting effects on high latitudes and that prescribed burning has the potential to benefit biodiversity over decades in these landscapes while also highlighting the value of considering the whole species community and not only monitoring abundance and richness to assess biodiversity after management actions.

AB  - Socially inefficient payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes result when adverse shifts in the provisioning of other ecosystem services (ES) or overpayment to service providers occur. To address these inefficiencies, a holistic evaluation of trade-offs between services should be conducted in parallel with determining land owners' service provisioning preferences. Recent evidence also suggests that nudging stakeholders' preferences could be a useful policy design tool to address global change challenges. Forest owners' landscape management preferences were nudged to determine the impact on the social efficiency of PES schemes for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Finland. ES indicators for biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and the albedo effect were included with traditional provisioning services (i.e. timber) and bioenergy to assess the consequent intra-service trade-offs. Synergies in provisioning of regulating services were identified, but were found to be more efficient when the management objective is for biodiversity conservation rather than climate change regulation. Nudging led to marginal gains in service provisioning above the baseline management and above neutral owner preferences, and increased aggregate service provisioning. This demonstrates the importance of considering intra-service trade-offs and that nudging could be an important tool for designing efficient PES schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen and sulphur deposition is considered as a negative factor for biodiversity, usually leading to changes in species composition and structure of plant communities, and ultimately to the impoverishment of biodiversity. In this study we investigated the variation over time (2001, 2006, 2011) in species composition and structure of the understory vegetation at varying levels of sulphur and nitrogen deposition in two conifer plantations (>100 year-old) growing in different climate areas of Poland (Scots pine at the Slowinki National Park, northern seaside; Norway spruce at the Tatrzanski National Park, southern mountains). The structure of the floor vegetation at both sites changed markedly during the studied decade, as clearly confirmed by principal component analysis. Among the environmental variables analyzed (NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, pH in the throughfall and in soil solution sampled at two different depths), only nitrates were non-significantly correlated with PC axes. The results confirmed the negative effects of the concentration of both elements on undergrowth and tree recruitment in the coastal stand (Empetro nigri-Pinetum). On the other hand, in the mountain stand (Abieti-Piceetum) we observed an increase over time of nitrophilous species typical of the beech forest, which represent the natural vegetation of this area, suggesting a gradual natural restoration of the native vegetation in the long run.

AB  - Forest management practices modify the composition and three-dimensional structure of boreal forests. Such changes affect light regimes, microclimate and habitat availability in forests, thus contributing to the regulation of ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Compared to traditional even-aged forestry, prevalent in Fenno-scandia since the mid-20th century, uneven-aged forestry has emerged as an alternative approach that may lead to more diverse and resilient forests, as well as a more sustainable provision of ecosystem services. However, the biophysical impacts of uneven-aged strategies have not yet been robustly quantified. Here, we present a detailed assessment of the structural characteristics of even-aged and uneven-aged boreal forest stands in southern Finland, aiming to clarify how these different management approaches regulate three-dimensional forest structure. Using terrestrial laser scanning, we derived and compared several structural traits closely linked to forest functioning. We found that, although different management types result in similar patterns in total plant material, they differ significantly on how plant material is allocated within vertical strata. Moreover, we demonstrated that commonly used structural diversity metrics cannot not capture the morphological intricacies arising from the three-dimensional dispersion of plant material inside the forest stand. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of even-aged forests, where the structural characteristics change with the rotation, whereas uneven-aged forest structures are more stable over time. Precise quantification of forest structure will help to understand which attributes impact the environmental functions and conditions that modify ecosystem services, and how these are altered with forest management.

AB  - Research into mixed-forests has increased substantially in the last decades but the extent to which the new knowledge generated meets practitioners' concerns and is adequately transmitted to them is unknown. Here we provide the current state of knowledge and future research directions with regards to 10 questions about mixed forest functioning and management identified and selected by a range of European forest managers during an extensive participatory process. The set of 10 questions were the highest ranked questions from an online prioritization exercise involving 168 managers from 22 different European countries. In general, the topics of major concern for forest managers coincided with the ones that are at the heart of most research projects. They covered important issues related to the management of mixed forests and the role of mixtures for the stability of forests faced with environmental changes and the provision of ecosystem services to society. Our analysis showed that the current scientific knowledge about these questions was rather variable and particularly low for those related to the management of mixed forests over time and the associated costs. We also found that whereas most research projects have sought to evaluate whether mixed forests are more stable or provide more goods and services than monocultures, there is still little information on the underlying mechanisms and trade-offs behind these effects. Similarly, we identified a lack of knowledge on the spatio-temporal scales at which the effects of mixtures on the resistance and adaptability to environmental changes are operating. Our analysis may help researchers to identify what knowledge needs to be better transferred and to better design future research initiatives meeting practitioner's concerns.

AB  - Saproxylic insects play an important part in decomposing dead wood in healthy forest ecosystems, but little is known about their role in the aftermath of large-scale forest mortality caused by pest insect outbreaks. We used window traps to study short-term changes in the abundance and community structure of saproxylic beetles following extensive mortality of mountain birch in sub-arctic northern Norway caused by an outbreak of geometrid moths. Three to five years after the outbreak, the proportion of obligate saproxylic individuals in the beetle community was roughly 10% higher in forest damaged by the outbreak than in undamaged forest. This was mainly due to two early-successional saproxylic beetle species. Facultative saproxylic beetles showed no consistent differences between damaged and undamaged forest. These findings would suggest a weak numerical response of the saproxylic beetle community to the dead wood left by the outbreak. We suggest that species-specific preferences for certain wood decay stages may limit the number of saproxylic species that respond numerically to an outbreak at a particular time, and that increases in responding species may be constrained by limitations to the amount of dead wood that can be exploited within a given timeframe (i.e. satiation effects). Low diversity of beetle species or slow development of larvae in our cold sub-arctic study region may also limit numerical responses. Our study suggests that saproxylic beetles, owing to weak numerical responses, may so far have played a minor role in decomposing the vast quantities of dead wood left by the moth outbreak.

AB  - Forests play an important role in the sequestration of carbon dioxide and the storage of carbon. The potential and efficiency of mitigation options in forestry have been studied using large-scale forestry scenario models. In Finland, three models have been applied in attempts to estimate timber production and related carbon budgets. In this study, these models are compared. The oldest, MELA, was designed in the 1970s for the regional and national analysis of timber production. The European Forest Information Scenario Model, EFISCEN, originally a Swedish area matrix model, was developed in the early 1980s. SIMA, a gap-type ecosystem model, was utilised in the 1990s for regional predictions on how the changing climate may affect forest growth and timber yield in Finland. In EFISCEN, only the development of growing stock is endogeneous because the assumptions on growth, and the removal and rules for felling are given exogeneously. In the SIMA model, the rules for felling are exogeneous but the growth is modelled based on individual trees reacting to their environment. In the MELA model, the management of forests is endogeneous, i.e. the growth, felling regimes and the development of growing stock are the results of the analysis. The MELA approach integrated with a process-based ecosystem model seems most applicable in the analyses of effective mitigation measures compatible with sustainable forestry under a changing climate. When using the scenarios for the estimation of carbon budget, the policy makers should check that the analyses cover the whole area of interest, and that the assumptions on growth and management together with the definitions applied correspond with the forestry conditions in question.

AB  - Temperate and boreal forest ecosystems contain a large part of the carbon stored on land, in the form of both biomass and soil organic matter. Increasing atmospheric [CO2], increasing temperature, elevated nitrogen deposition and intensified management will change this C store. Well documented single-factor responses of net primary production are: higher photosynthetic rate (the main [CO2] response); increasing length of growing season (the main temperature response); and higher leaf-area index (the main N deposition and partly [CO2] response). Soil organic matter will increase with increasing litter input, although priming may decrease the soil C stock initially, but litter quality effects should be minimal (response to [CO2], N deposition, and temperature); will decrease because of increasing temperature; and will increase because of retardation of decomposition with N deposition, although the rate of decomposition of high-quality litter can be increased and that of low-quality litter decreased. Single-factor responses can be misleading because of interactions between factors, in particular those between N and other factors, and indirect effects such as increased N availability from temperature-induced decomposition. In the long term the strength of feedbacks, for example the increasing demand for N from increased growth, will dominate over short-term responses to single factors. However, management has considerable potential for controlling the C store.

AB  - We studied how different thinning regimes and initial age structures of a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest landscape affect the radiative forcing of forest biomass production and use. We considered the effects of forest carbon sequestration, substitution of materials and fossil fuels with forest biomass, and timber use efficiency. The initial age structures of our hypothetical forest landscapes in the middle boreal zone in Finland were young, middle-aged, and mature. Forest landscapes were thinned using either the current thinning recommendations (baseline) or maintaining 20% higher or 20% lower stocking over the 80-year study period. We employed forest ecosystem model simulations together with a life cycle assessment tool. The highest carbon sequestration was obtained by maintaining higher stocking in the landscapes. The initially middle-aged and mature age structures resulted in the strongest cooling of the climate in the first three decades of the simulation, but the highest cooling was found in the young age structure. However, radiative forcing was less sensitive to the thinning than to the substitution or timber use efficiency. Our results indicate that modeled climate impacts are affected by both initial age structure and forest management, which should be considered when generalizing the climate change mitigation potential of forests and forestry.

AB  - We studied the role of red deer Cervus elaphus L. as ecosystem modi. er in boreal forest (Tingvoll municipality, 62 degrees 52' N, 8 degrees 20'E, Norway), during early summer of 2001. The effect of grazing by red deer on ground beetles (Carabidae) abundance and diversity was investigated across a gradient of grazing pressures. We trapped ground beetles by pit-fall traps from three homogeneous winter grazing areas (ungrazed, medium grazed, heavily grazed). Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus (the main winter food for red deer) was sampled and its dry weight was measured for the three locations. Gradient analyses showed that grazing by red deer affects carabid species composition. Grazing significantly affected the amount of bilberry, which correlated with species variation. According to our predictions, we found a higher abundance of carabids in the heavily grazed location, but the species richness and the diversity indices were similar for the three areas. This study shows that overall species composition is altered along a gradient as consequence of red deer winter grazing and that red deer act as ecosystem engineer, by reducing the bilberry heather which dominates the field layer in early summer.

AB  - Uneven-aged mountain forests are considered favourable for the continuous provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ES). These ES may however exhibit trade-offs or synergies that can be modulated by forest management. Yet, our knowledge remains poor on both the relationships between ES and the way management practices can optimise and reconcile them. In this study, we aimed at (1) characterising trade-offs and synergies between timber production, biodiversity conservation and protection against natural hazards; (2) identifying efficient (i.e. Pareto-optimal) management scenarios for the joint provisioning of these ES; and (3) comparing them to "reference" management scenarios. Using a simulation framework that couples a forest dynamics model, a silviculture algorithm and linker functions relating ES indicators to stand structure, we predicted the response of different ES indicators to various uneven-aged management practices in the Western Alps. With a metamodeling approach and Pareto front techniques, we intensively explored and analysed relationships between ES indicators and found trade-offs between timber production and other ES, but synergies between protection and biodiversity. "Pareto-optimal" management scenarios were characterised by low thinning and harvesting intensities but exhibited gradients of total removals and deadwood and large tree retention along the Pareto front. They greatly differed from our set of production and biodiversity oriented reference scenarios, thus emphasising the strong impact of considering additional ES in scenario optimisation processes. This study highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of Pareto front techniques for both the analysis of trade-offs and synergies between ES and the identification of efficient management practices.

AB  - Success of individual CCS projects as well as integration of CCS into larger energy systems depend on institutional and organizational support from a variety of contexts. We map stakeholder perceptions from an institutional perspective and present a framework for identifying path dependencies, challenges and opportunities in the dynamic development of the social, political and economic setting around CCS technologies. The analysis is based on data collected on two Finnish CCS demonstration projects; a cancelled retro-fit project for a coal-fired power plant and a recently developed method for mineralizing CO2 into stable calcium carbonate. Our goal is to examine which uncertainties are considered most significant and most likely to affect the development and employment of CCS technologies. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - We investigated the relationships between dehydrogenase activity and the physicochemical properties of mountain soils over three and five years from Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) logging residue spot burning and the occurrence of epigeic carabid beetles. Six study sites were utilised, including 18 study plots (nine plots in a mixed coniferous mountain forest site and nine plots in a mixed broadleaf mountain forest site), with five replicate pitfall traps at each site located in southern Poland. Soil samples from the organic horizon were taken for pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, base cation content, acidity and dehydrogenase activity determination. Carabid beetles were monitored in weekly intervals during the period of July to August 2016. The burning of logging residues led to modified soil properties, especially the dehydrogenase activity. In all the tested variants, the activity was higher in soil samples after the burning in comparison to the control variants. We show no positive correlation between dehydrogenase activity and the number of carabid specimens. The preferences of dominant predatory hygrophilous carabids to acid habitats with weakly decomposed organic matter were proven. Simultaneously, the soil organic matter content was positively related to the carabid abundance. The significant impact of forest site conditions and the date of logging residue burning on the number of caught specimens were confirmed. In contrast, no relationships between the species richness, species diversity, mean individual biomass and spot burning effect were found. This work supports the recommendation of spruce fine woody debris utilisation by spot burning on mountain regions with rich habitats presenting moderate wet conditions and small land falls.

AB  - The macrophytes Fucus serratus and Zostera marina form similar substrates for associated flora and fauna in shallow waters in Norway. While F. serratus forms a more or less continuous belt on rocky substrate along the coast, Z. marina forms disjunct populations on sandy or muddy bottoms. This study focused on the organisms associated with these two macrophytes in two localities in the Skagerrak region. In total, 130 taxa of epiphytic organisms were identified: 22 green algae, 41 red algae, 32 brown algae, eight diatoms and 27 sessile animals. One hundred and twenty-seven taxa of mobile macrofauna were registered. The dominant group was crustaceans, with amphipods as the order containing most species. Many species of both plants and animals preferred one or the other habitat. It is concluded that coastal macrophyte systems have high species diversity.

AB  - The death of overstory trees creates gaps in forest canopies. These canopy gaps have positive impacts on forests, including enhancing species diversity. The relative contributions to canopy gap closure made by understory trees within gaps and overstory trees at gap edges determines the future structure and species composition of a forest.
   Most studies of tree growth responses to gaps have focused on understory trees or canopy expansion by overstory trees. Here we focus on the stem radial growth rates of overstory trees and forest growth rates, measured as stand basal area increment. Our study area was a mature mixed-age, mixed-species deciduous forest in south-central Pennsylvania, USA.
   A hierarchical regression analysis found that gap-edge trees greater than or equal to20 cm dbh (diameter at breast height, 1.3 m) had 26% higher stem radial growth rates than comparable trees not located at gap edges (P = 0.004). Our hypothesis that smaller overstory trees would experience a greater growth benefit at gap edges was marginally supported (P = 0.06). A tree's position north or south of a gap did not influence its growth response to the gap. The results suggest that overstory trees make an important contribution to canopy gap closure.
   Canopy gaps reduced the area occupied by overstory trees by 16%. But based on our regression model of stem radial growth rates, nearly two-thirds of the stand basal area increment lost because of gaps was offset by the enhanced growth of trees at gap edges (considering trees greater than or equal to20 cm dbh only). A simple, spatially-explicit process model of tree and forest growth in relation to Gaps supported this finding. These results demonstrate that the benefits of canopy gaps come at a cost in forest growth rates that is considerably less than the pp area indicates. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We sampled bryophytes in 52 rapids in regulated and unregulated north Swedish rivers to quantify effects of flow regulation on taxonomic richness and abundance of bryophytes. Predictive models based on the conditions at unregulated sites were used to predict richness and abundance at impacted sites and the residuals were used as a measure of the effect of regulation.
   Taxonomic richness was 22% lower than predicted at sites with reduced flow and 26% at sites with regulated but unreduced flow. The overall abundance of bryophytes was not significantly different from predicted. However, an analysis of the five most abundant species showed that the abundances of two species, Fontinalis antipyretica and F. dalecarlica, was lower than predicted at sites with reduced flow, while the abundance of Blindia acuta and Schistidium agassizii was higher than predicted at sites with regulated but unreduced flow.

AB  - Aim Land use is the foremost cause of global biodiversity decline, but species do not respond equally to land-use practices. Instead, it is suggested that responses vary with species traits, but long-term data on the trait-mediated effects of land use on communities are scarce. Here we study how forest understorey communities have been affected by two land-use practices during 4-5 decades, and whether changes in plant diversity are related to changes in functional composition. Location Finland. Time period 1968-2019. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We resurveyed 245 vegetation plots in boreal herb-rich forest understories, and used hierarchical Bayesian linear models to relate changes in diversity, species composition, average plant size, and leaf economic traits to reindeer abundance, forest management intensity, and changes in climate, canopy cover and composition. We also studied the relationship between species evenness and plant size across both space and time. Results Intensively managed forests decreased in species richness and had increased turnover, but management did not affect functional composition. Increased reindeer densities corresponded with increased leaf dry matter content, evenness and diversity, and decreased height and specific leaf area. Successional development in the canopy was associated with increased specific leaf area and decreased leaf dry matter content and height in the understorey over the study period. Effects of reindeer abundance and canopy density on diversity were partially mediated by vegetation height, which had a negative relationship with evenness across both space and time. Observed changes in climate had no discernible effect on any variable. Main conclusions Functional traits are useful in connecting vegetation changes to the mechanisms that drive them, and provide unique information compared to turnover and diversity metrics. These trait-dependent selection effects could inform which species benefit and which suffer from land-use changes and explain observed biodiversity changes under global change.

AB  - We investigated allozyme variation in 34 populations of the perennial herb Silene nutans from Sweden and northern Finland, areas that were ice-covered during the last (Weichselian) glaciation. The present geographical structure of genetic variation in S. nutans in Sweden and northern Finland appears to have been mainly shaped by ancient historical processes. Patterns of variation in allele frequencies suggest two major postglacial immigration routes into Sweden, with populations entering the area from both the south and the east and forming a contact zone with admixed populations in central Sweden. While estimates of within-population genetic diversity and allelic richness are significantly correlated with present population size and geographical position (latitude), population size is not correlated with latitude. Low genetic diversity in the northern populations is more likely to have resulted from ancient stochastic events during the process of immigration than from recent population fragmentation. F-IS values are high and increase with latitude. Evidence of recent bottlenecks was detected in several southern Swedish populations: these can be interpreted in terms of population fragmentation as a result of anthropogenic disturbance. Soil pH is uncorrelated with population size and position. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London,

AB  - The composition of the avifauna in the upland forests of western Rodopi (North Greece) was investigated during spring and summer of 1997 and 1998. A total of 109 species were detected in the area, while 93 of them (85.3%) are regarded as breeders. Ten-minute counts in 260 points in plots of the most representative forest stands produced 3 418 bird sightings of 42 species (13.14 individuals/ point, (x) over bar = 6.2 species/ point). Bird density in different forest habitats ranged frorn six to 34 birds/ 10 ha ((x) over bar = 19 birds/ 10 ha). The greatest figure was recorded in oak woods and conifer forests dominated by mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) and the lowest in pinewoods. Species diversity was also greater in Norway spruce and broadleaf forests. Species richness should be attributed to the geographical position of the area, and the differences in bird density to the vegetation structure in the various forest habitats.

AB  - We examined an alternative natural regeneration practice with a scarification treatment, in which removed soil is replaced on the scarified area, in northern Japan. The effect of the soil replacement on tree establishment was quite obvious; the basal area of trees, composed mostly of Betula ermanii, in the soil-replaced site was about 150-fold greater than that of the normally treated site. The greater growth rates together with higher density, both of which seemed to be enhanced by improved (i.e., deeper, tender, and nutrient-rich) soil properties, produced the marked difference to the normally treated site. The expected enhancement of species diversity owing to utilizing buried seeds in the replaced soil was not found. The current study revealed that the soil replacement could substantially improve forest restoration management with emphasis on biomass production for large nonwooded sites.

AB  - To assess population structure and genetic diversity among northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), we compared mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from three populations in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Skin-biopsy samples were collected from animals in the Gully off Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1996 and 1997 (n = 20), and teeth were obtained from whales taken in Davis Strait off northern Labrador (n = 20) and off northern Iceland (n = 5) between 1967 and 1971 by the historical Norwegian fishery. Only low levels of genetic diversity were found among the 45 animals sampled (three polymorphic sites over 434 base pairs defining four haplotypes; haplotype diversity (h) = 0.57, nucleotide diversity (pi) = 0.0015). The cause of this low variability is unclear but may be due to a possible bottleneck event associated with the last glaciation. The distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes between the Gully and Davis Strait populations was suggestive of regional differentiation (F-ST = 0.118, P = 0.024; Phi(ST) = 0.145, P = 0.007). Animals taken off northern Iceland were not included in statistical analyses of population structure, owing to the small sample size. These data, in conjunction with other information collected to date, indicate that the Gully and Davis Strait populations should be considered separate stocks for management purposes.

AB  - This article deepens our understanding of the preconditions for policy-oriented learning in conflictive marine conservation, provides an analytical framework for further studies and formulates recommendations for practitioners on what to consider when establishing protected areas. Our seas are under increasing pressure but lag behind in protection. Climate change, intensifying use and biodiversity loss challenge current practises and imply trade-offs between conservation and use. While nature conservation ranks high internationally, national protection attempts often result in controversies, with actors aligning in opposing advocacy coalitions-for and against the proposals. Policy-oriented learning is one way to overcome controversies. It involves processes whereby actors gain new knowledge and experiences, leading to changed beliefs about the problems and possible solutions. We aimed to explore and explain policy-oriented learning through a comparative longitudinal case study of two Swedish national park planning processes with different outcomes: Koster Sea national park, established 2009, and Sankt Anna archipelago remaining without park. Which characteristics related to context, actors and processes influence policy-oriented learning in conflictive marine conservation processes? The results suggest that a set of complementary factors explain the different outcomes. First, learning is facilitated by contexts where actors from both coalitions depend on the resource and its protection and have experience of collaboration, and where conservation planning is well integrated with other governance processes. Second, engaged key actors with moderate views facilitating interactions and able to identify common interests and deescalate conflicts are important - supported, third, by various forums allowing exchange of knowledge and learning across coalitions.

AB  - Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest, forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention, recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services, and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services, which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Uneven-aged forest management is suggested to be a sustainable management alternative in boreal forests, but knowledge on applicable harvest intensities is very limited as majority of the studies has focused on even-aged management practices. The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10-30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8-16 m(2) ha(-1)). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m(-2) a(-1) of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5-20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m(3) ha(-1) for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5-7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80-120 m(3) ha(-1) was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40-60 m(3) ha(-1). The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need to understand species distribution- and biodiversity patterns in high-latitude marine regions is immediate as these marine environments are undergoing rapid environmental changes, including ocean warming and ocean acidification. By the year 2100, the seas north of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe (GIF) topographic ridge are predicted to become largely corrosive to aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate commonly formed by calcifying molluscs. We examine depth-diversity relationships in bivalves and gastropods north and south of the GIF ridge, between 200 and 2000 m depth. We also identify bivalve and gastropod species that could be monitored to identify early signs of changes in benthic communities north of the GIF ridge, due to ocean acidification. Patterns of alpha-diversity were estimated through rarefaction, as E(S-20). Regional and depth related beta-diversity was analyzed and the additive contribution of species replacement (turnover) and species loss/gain (nestedness) to beta-diversity calculated. Despite sharing a significant number of species, diversity patterns differed between the study regions. The diversity patterns also differed between bivalves and gastropods. North of the GIF ridge, the relationship between alpha-diversity and depth was unimodal with a predominant decrease in bivalve and gastropod alpha-diversity between 300 and 2000 m depth. Species assemblages in the deep bathyal zone were partly nested subsets of the assemblages in the shallow bathyal zone. South of the GIF ridge, patterns in alpha-diversity were more ambiguous. Alpha diversity decreased between 300 and 2000 m depth in bivalves, with no clear trend observed in gastropods. This finding contradicts the recognized increase in alpha-diversity in the bathyal zone in the North Atlantic basin, perhaps due to the oceanographic conditions directly south of the GIF ridge. In contrast to that observed north of the GIF ridge, nestedness did not contribute significantly to beta-diversity south of the GIF ridge. This comparative study sheds new light on deep-sea diversity patterns of molluscs in the high-latitude North Atlantic and provides baseline data on species occurrences. This information can inform future assessment of the impact of environmental changes in these regions and management efforts.

AB  - Land use in general and particularly agricultural practices can significantly influence soil carbon storage. In this paper, we investigate the long-term effects of management changes on soil carbon stock dynamics on a Swedish farm where C concentrations were measured in 1956 at 124 points in a regular grid. The soil was re-sampled at 65 points in 1984 and at all grid points in 2001. Before 1956 most of the fodder for dairy cattle was produced on the farm and crop rotations were dominated by perennial grass leys and spring cereals with manure addition. In 1956 all animals were sold; crop rotations were thereafter dominated by wheat, barley and rapeseed. Spatial variation in topsoil C concentration decreased significantly between 1956 and 2001. C stocks declined in fields with initially large C stocks but did not change significantly in fields with moderate C stocks. In the latter fields, soil C concentrations declined from 1956 to 1984, but increased slightly thereafter according to both measurements and simulations. Thus, the decline in C input due to the altered management in 1956 was partly compensated for by increasing crop yields and management changes, resulting in increased C input during the last 20 years. A soil carbon balance model (ICBM) was used to describe carbon dynamics during 45 years. Yield records were transformed to soil carbon input using allometric functions. Topsoil C concentrations ranging between 1.8 and 2.4% (depending on individual field properties) seemed to be in dynamic equilibrium with C input under recent farming and climatic conditions. Subsoil C concentrations seemed to be unaffected by the management changes.

AB  - Governments increasingly struggle to protect representative nature types and ecological diversity within their territories only via the instrument of publicly designated protected areas. This article examines the rise of voluntary conservation and certification (i.e., private conservation) as tools for forest protection in Norway and Canada. We contrast the differing potential of these private conservation tools with protection through government legislation and regulation using four evaluative criteria: the representativeness of protected areas, the strength of protection, the longevity of protection, and the information generated through protection. We find that private conservation tools can match the strength of legal protection and help to dispel conflict, but that private tools create protection that is more likely to be reversed in the future. However, we also show that voluntary private conservation can become public protection, which highlights the importance of examining different paths toward secure and long-lasting protection.

AB  - Agri-environmental policies in Europe are failing to sufficiently address ongoing environmental degradation, biodiversity decline, climate impacts, and societal demands for sustainability. To reverse this, policymakers, practitioners, and farmers need better guidance on which specific agricultural practice/s should be promoted and how to adapt current practices to reach the desired objectives. Here we use social valuation tools to elucidate the relationship between agricultural practices and the provision of key ecosystem services in mountains, including maintenance of scenery from agricultural landscapes, conservation of biodiversity, regulation of climate change through carbon sequestration, production of local quality products, maintenance of soil fertility, and prevention of forest wildfires. We use as case studies two contrasting but representative mountain agroecosystems in the Mediterranean and Nordic regions of Europe. We analyze the best agricultural practices in both agroecosystems to reach the targeted environmental outcomes under three plausible policy scenarios. We find significant dif-ferences in the average contribution of agricultural practices to ecosystem services provision, which suggest the need for regionalizing the research efforts and, consequently, the design of agri-environmental policies. How-ever, we also identify practices for ecosystem service delivery across policy scenarios and agroecosystems. Among these, grazing and silviculture practices such as extending the grazing period, grazing in semi-natural habitats, grazing in remote and abandoned areas, adapting stocking rate to the carrying capacity, and moving flocks seasonally, stand out for their relevance in all policy scenarios. These results highlight the potential of adequate grazing and silviculture practices to deliver bundles of ecosystem services. Our study provides guidance to design agri-environmental policies in Europe that focus on rewarding farmers for their sustainable manage-ment of natural resources, climate change mitigation and adaption and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - This paper presents the baseline design of a 34,000-tonne subsea shuttle tanker (SST). The SST is proposed as an alternative to subsea pipelines and surface tankers for the transportation of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) from existing offshore/land facilities to marginal subsea fields. In contrast to highly weather-dependent surface tanker operations, the SST can operate in any condition underwater. The SST is an electric-powered autonomous underwater vehicle with a length and beam of 164 m and 17 m, respectively. It has a cargo carrying capacity of 16,362 m3. This capacity is sufficient to allow the SST to fulfil the annual storage demands of ongoing carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Norway. It travels with a slow speed of 6 knots at 70 m constant water depth for maximum energy efficiency and offloads CO2 via a connected coupling to the subsea well where CO2 is directly injected. To be economically attractive, the SST has a high payload of 50% displacement which makes a low structural weight design extremely crucial. This is achieved by employing a double hull design for the SST with active pressure compensating systems to cope with the large collapse pressure loads underwater.

AB  - The main objective of this work was to analyse how increased harvesting for bioenergy production might affect other Ecosystem Services (ES) in two Norwegian municipalities (Ringsaker and Voss). The aim was to identify locations where synergies or conflicts between ES could be expected. The spatial distribution of eight different ES (3 provision, 3 regulation and 2 cultural services) was modelled using information provided by land use spatial databases and additional data sources. Model parameters were set by integrating existing research and expert knowledge. Maps showing the level of provision of ES were analysed using a moving window to analyse scale dependence in the spatial distribution of ES provision. Map algebra was then used to identify areas providing multiple ES, thus defining the most important areas on which to focus the management of both synergies and trade-offs. Finally, specific 'binary bundles' maps, where bioenergy provision was compared with each of the other ES, were developed. The methodology proved its utility to assess the compatibility of bioenergy uses with other services. This straightforward approach is readily replicable in other regions and can be used as a decision support tool for planning and designing provision areas, and to ensure sustainable forest management approaches.

AB  - Palaeoecological studies can identify past trends in vegetation communities and processes over long time scales. Pollen, plant macrofossils and charcoal analyses are used to reconstruct vegetation over the last 6400 years and provide information about former human impact and disturbance regimes in Farnebofjarden National Park, Central Sweden. Three specific conservation planning topics were addressed: (1) the changing ratio of conifers to broadleaved trees; (2) the origin and history of the river meadows and the biodiverse Populus tremula meadows; (3) the role of fire in the maintenance of biological values. Early diverse mixed broadleaved forest assemblages with pine were followed by significant declines of the more thermophilic forest elements prior to the expansion of spruce in the Iron Age. The rise to dominance of spruce was a 'natural' process that has been exaggerated by anthropogenic disturbance to artificially high levels today. The initial river meadow communities were facilitated by fire and frequent flooding events, but subsequent dynamics have more definitely been supported by human activities. Rural abandonment during the last 100 years has led to woody successions. Fire has been a continual disturbance factor with an influence on conservation issues such as Picea abies dominance and the maintenance of diverse, non-forest communities. Present occurrence of fire is unusually low, but natural fire frequencies are increasing in the region.

AB  - The establishment of biomass plantations with short-rotation forestry principles is one of the after-use options for cutaway peatlands. We studied biomass production and carbon sequestration in the above- and below-ground biomass of 25 naturally afforested, 10-30 years old downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stands located in peat cutaway areas in Finland. Self-thinning reduced the stand density from 122,000 trees ha(-1) (stand age of 10 years) to 10,000 trees ha(-1) (25-30 years), while the leafless above-ground biomass increased from 17 Mg ha(-1) up to 79-116 Mg ha(-1). The total leafless biomass (including stumps and roots) varied from 46 to 151 Mg ha(-1). The mean annual increment (MAI) of the above-ground biomass increased up to the stand age of 15 years, after which the MAI was on the average 3.2 Mg ha(-1)a(-1). With below-ground biomass, the MAI of the stands older than 15 years was 4.7 Mg ha(-1). The organic matter accumulated in the O-layer on the top of the residual peat increased linearly with the stand age, reaching 29.3 Mg ha(-1) in the oldest stand. The O-layer contributed significantly to the C sink, and the afforestation with downy birch converted most of sites into C sinks.

AB  - Forestry has an important role to play as a provider of energy from renewable biomass and through the sequestration of carbon in biomass and soil. Forests are also habitats for a large number of species which are important for biodiversity. In some cases, these two roles may conflict. The aim of this study was to model the implications of specific environmental quality objectives on the potential of forestry to reduce net CO2 emissions by addressing interim targets 1 and 2 in the environmental quality objective, sustainable forests for Uppsala County and used this region as a case study. The carbon stock in the biomass, the substitution effect, and the economic consequences associated with six forest management scenarios were considered. The development for the scenarios was simulated at stand level using an empirical model. The results of the study showed that the shortest rotation period was preferable to mitigate net CO2 emissions since it resulted in more biomass that could replace fossil fuel. However, such a strategy might affect sustainable policies negatively. Increasing the extent of mixed stands could be a preferable strategy since it may achieve several objectives.

AB  - The Norwegian Lundehund is a highly endangered native dog breed. Low fertility and high frequency predisposition to intestinal disorder imply inbreeding depression. We assessed the genetic diversity of the Lundehund population from pedigree data and evaluated the potential of optimal contribution selection and cross-breeding in the long-term management of the Lundehund population. The current Norwegian Lundehund population is highly inbred and has lost 38.8% of the genetic diversity in the base population. Effective population size estimates varied between 13 and 82 depending on the method used. Optimal contribution selection alone facilitates no improvement in the current situation in the Lundehund due to the extremely high relatedness of the whole population. Addition of (replacement with) 10 breeding candidates of foreign breed to 30 Lundehund breeders reduced the parental additive genetic relationship by 40-42% (48-53%). Immediate actions are needed to increase the genetic diversity in the current Lundehund population. The only option to secure the conservation of this rare breed is to introduce individuals from foreign breeds as breeding candidates.

AB  - Earlier research has suggested that the diversification of silvicultural strategies is a cost-efficient tool to ensure multifunctionality in production forests. This study compared the effects of continuous cover forestry and conventional rotation forestry on ecosystem services and biodiversity in boreal forests in Finland. We simulated over 25,000 commercial forest stands for 100 years under continuous cover and rotation forest management. Forests without management were used as a reference. We compared the effects of silvicultural practices over space and time on ecosystem services, biodiversity indicators and multifunctionality. Our results revealed that continuous cover forestry was better than rotation forest management in terms of timber net present value, carbon sequestration, bilberry production, scenic beauty and the number of large trees. It provided higher habitat availability for indicator species dependent on deciduous trees and mature forest structure. Rotation forest management was better than continuous cover forestry in terms of harvested tree biomass, cowberries, mushrooms, and species dependent on high tree volume. In general, multifunctionality was higher in continuous cover forests than in rotation forests. Therefore, continuous cover forests may have a greater potential to produce simultaneously multiple benefits from forests. However, unmanaged forests often provided the highest levels of services and biodiversity making their role indispensable in delivering forest related ecosystem services and, especially, in the maintenance of biodiversity. Continuous cover forestry does not itself guarantee the maintenance of all ecosystem services and biodiversity in commercial forests but it can be an important part of a successful progression towards more sustainable forestry.

AB  - In recognition of the opportunities associated with climate change, the finance sector have engaged in market based activities via the acquisition of land for ecosystem services, such as biofuel production or forestry for carbon sequestration. Many of these investments are global in scope; with finance capital from the Global North directed into the acquisition of land in the global South. We take the case study of the self-proclaimed largest plantation forestry operator on the African continent, the Norwegian company, Green Resources and their Ugandan land acquisition, to explore, firstly, the claims-making associated with the expanding financialisation of land and natural resources and secondly, the new corporate enclosures engendered via such companies' participation in the expanding carbon economy. Our findings show that investor claims regarding the economic development and environmental sustainability at the site level do not match with the lived reality of Ugandan villagers at the investment site. Whilst carbon capture is possible, it is outweighed by a suite of social and environment ills, including-forced dispossession, biodiversity loss and chemical pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - European grayling, Thymallus thymallus (L.), populations have steadily declined since the mid-1980s, mostly because of habitat degradation and increased predation pressure. To provide guidelines for conservation strategies and future management programmes, delineation of conservation and management units is warranted. Over the last decade, several studies have investigated the phylogeography and population genetic structure of T. thymallus using mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite DNA markers. However, no study has covered the distribution range of T. thymallus across Europe; thus, a comprehensive survey of the evolutionary history of the species is lacking. This paper synthesises the major findings of the molecular studies and provides guidelines for the conservation and management of genetic resources of T. thymallus. At least five major mtDNA lineages have evolved in geographical isolation during the Pleistocene and these lineages should be recognised as the basic evolutionary significant units for T. thymallus in northern, central and southern Europe. There is also evidence for a high level of admixture among major lineages and sublineages, especially in the contact zones of drainages (e.g. in mainland Sweden and Norway and in central Germany), most probably resulting from a complex process of post-glacial and inter-glacial colonisation and re-colonisation events from different refugia during the Pleistocene ice ages. Based on the microsatellite data, T. thymallus shows a substantial level of inter-population genetic differentiation and, compared with other freshwater fish species, a relatively low level of within-population genetic diversity. The species develops discrete population structure, both within hydrologically connected rivers or lakes on comparatively small scales as well as in large river systems.

AB  - To meet the environmental challenges that are presently confronting society, the narrow focus on agricultural production needs to be altered to one that places equal value on the generation of crucial ecosystem services. Current research shows that perennial intercropping systems such as agroforestry may be a feasible alternative. Based on studies during the establishment of edible forest gardens in 12 participating farms in Sweden, this paper explores the potential of utilizing multi-strata designs for food production in temperate, high-income countries. Design and species composition of such gardens, types of food they provide, and how they would best fit into the present landscape are discussed. Factors for success and major problems related to the establishment are shared. Potential benefits were found to be closely related to a thorough analysis of the social and ecological contexts before establishment. Characteristics of the site and goals of the garden need to guide species and design choices. If forest garden approaches to food production should contribute to more than local self-sufficiency, the gardens need to increase in scale. Marginal lands and transitions areas between different land uses may be appropriate. Large knowledge gaps concerning potential production, social and economic benefits, and agronomic issues were identified.

AB  - The effects of fish cage farming were simulated in littoral brackish water mesocosms. Two different dry fish feeds were used in the experiment, one commercially available feed and a purpose made feed containing 30% feral Baltic herring from the Archipelago Sea, SW Finland. Functional as well as structural effects of the fish farming simulation were obtained. The production limiting factor in the mesocosm appeared to be ammonium excreted by the fish. Excretion of nutrients was studied separately. Fish farming simulation initiated a successional development in the mesocosms in the form of higher sedimentation, higher sediment carbon content, a peak of BOD7 outflow, no or limited total organic carbon efflux and higher respiration as compared to the control over the experimental period. rue functional effects coincided with higher sediment invertebrate biomass and abundance: the Baltic mussel, Macoma baltica and Chironomus plumosus were all favored by nutrient enrichment. Increased availability of ammonium also favored periphytic growth after an initial production peak of phytoplankton. Production of other than farmed fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was doubled by biomass. Based on the separate fish nutrient excretion test, an eco-management model was put together, The results from this calculation imply that a 30% addition of feral herring in dry feed would result in a 1000 t yr(-1) net removal of ammonium with a total fish production of 12000 t.

AB  - Peatlands that are close to a natural state are rich in biodiversity and are significant carbon storages. Simultaneously, peat resources are of interest to industry, which leads to competing interests and tensions regarding the use and management of peatlands. In this case study, we studied knowledge-management interactions through the development of participation and the resulting representation of nature (how nature was described), as well as the proposed and implemented conservation policy instruments. We focused on the years 2009-2015, when peatland management was intensively debated in Finland. We did an interpretative policy analysis using policy documents (Peatland Strategy; Government Resolution; Proposal for Conservation Programme) and environmental legislation as central data. Our results show how the representation of nature reflected the purpose of the documents and consensus of participants' values. The representation of nature changed from skewed use of ecosystem services to detailed ecological knowledge. However, simultaneously, political power changed and the planned supplementation programme for peatland conservation was not implemented. The Environment Protection Act was reformulated so that it prohibited the use of the most valuable peatlands. Landowners did not have the chance to fully participate in the policy process. Overall, the conservation policy instruments changed to emphasize voluntariness but without an adequate budget to ensure sufficient conservation.

AB  - Old growth stands of boreonemoral spruce (Picea abies) forests frequently have a shrub layer dominated by hazel (Corylus avellana) - a species which is generally excluded in intensively managed forests due to clearcutting activities. We sampled understory species composition, richness and biomass, as well as environmental variables beneath these two species and also within forest 'gaps' in order to determine the effect of overstory species on understory vegetation. Species richness and biomass of herbaceous plants was significantly greater under Corylus compared with plots under Picea and in forest gaps. Indicator species analysis found that many species were significantly associated with Corylus. We found 45% of the total species found under woody plants occurred exclusively under Corylus. Light availability in spring and summer was higher in gaps than under forest cover but no difference was found between plots under Corylus and Picea. Hence, reductions in light availability cannot explain the differences in species composition. However, Ellenberg indicator values showed that more light demanding species were found under Corylus compared to Picea, but most light demanding species were found in gaps. The litter layer under Picea was three times thicker than under Corylus and this may be an important mechanism determining differences in understory composition and richness between the woody species. The presence of Corylus is an important factor enhancing local diversity and small-scale species variation within coniferous stands. Hence, management should maintain areas of Corylus shrubs to maintain understory species diversity in boreal forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ant Formica cinerea in northern Europe has geographically isolated populations that were examined using five microsatellite loci. The populations differ widely regarding the social organization of colonies. Based on genetic relatedness (r) among worker nest mates, the populations were classified as M type with monogynous (single queen) colonies (r > 0.59), as P type with polygynous colonial networks (r < 0.1), or as intermediate with weakly polygynous colonies (0.16 < r < 0.47). The social types showed weak geographical clustering, but the overall distribution indicated that the shift between the social types has occurred several times. The geographically isolated populations had slightly reduced levels of genetic diversity compared to populations from areas where the species is abundant and continuously distributed. Many of the isolated populations consisted of monogynous or weakly polygynous colonies, making their effective population sizes small, and some of them also showed weak bottleneck effects. The overall level of microsatellite diversity within populations was relatively high and differentiation among populations low, indicating recent connections. Isolation of populations may thus be a new phenomenon resulting from reduction of suitable habitats. At the local level, we obtained limited support from a group of nearby subpopulations in southern Finland to the hypothesis that the P type is connected to restricted dispersal. Other P type populations did not, however, show similar elevated levels of differentiation.

AB  - Many exemplary projects have demonstrated that Nature-based Solutions (NBS) can contribute to climate change adaptation, but now the challenge is to scale up their use. Setting realistic policy goals requires knowing the amount of different NBS types that can fit in the urban space and the benefits that can be expected. This research aims to assess the potential for a full-scale implementation of NBS for climate-change adaptation in European cities, the expected benefits and co-benefits, and how these quantities relate to the urban structure of the cities. We selected three case studies: Barcelona (Spain), Malmo (Sweden), and Utrecht (the Netherlands), and developed six scenarios that simulate the current condition, the full-scale implementation of different NBS strategies (i.e., installing green roofs, de-sealing parking areas, enhancing vegetation in urban parks, and planting street trees), and a combination of them. Then we applied spatially-explicit methods to assess, for each scenario, two climate change-related benefits, i.e. heat mitigation and stormwater regulation, and three co benefits, namely carbon storage, biodiversity potential, and overall greenness. Finally, by breaking down the results per land use class, we investigated how the potential and benefits vary depending on the urban form. Most scenarios provide multiple benefits, but each one is characterized by a specific mix. In all cities, a full-scale deployment of green roofs shows the greatest potential to reduce runoff and increase biodiversity, while tree planting-either along streets or in urban parks- produces the greatest impact on heat mitigation and greenness. However, these results entail interventions of different size and in different locations. Planting street trees maximizes interventions in residential areas, but key opportunities for integrating most NBS types also lie in commercial and industrial areas. The results on the pros and cons of each scenario can support policy-makers in designing targeted NBS strategies for climate change adaptation.

AB  - In karst ecosystems, plants absorbing smaller amounts of nutrients, owing to shallow soil, show limited growth. In addition, fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) contribute to the regulation of nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the spatial and temporal variations of fine root biomass in different vegetation types of the karst region remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and vertical variation in biomass, necromass, and total mass of fine roots using sequential soil coring under different stages of vegetation restoration (grassland, shrubland, secondary forest, and primary forest) in Southwest China. The results showed that the fine root biomass and necromass ranged from 136.99 to 216.18 g m(-2) and 47.34 to 86.94 g m(-2), respectively. The total mass of fine roots and their production ranged from 187.00 to 303.11 g m(-2) and 55.74 to 100.84 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. They showed a single peak across the vegetation restoration gradient. The fine root biomass and total fine root mass also showed a single peak with seasonal change. In autumn, the fine root biomass was high, whereas the necromass was low. Most of the fine roots were concentrated in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm), which accounted more than 57% root biomass, and decreased with increasing soil depth. In addition, fine root production showed a similar vertical pattern of variation with biomass. Overall, our results suggested that fine roots show clear seasonal and vertical changes with vegetation succession. Moreover, there was a higher seasonal fluctuation and a greater vertical decreasing trend in late-successional stages than in the early-successional stages. The conversion of degraded land to forest could improve the productivity of underground ecosystems and vegetation restoration projects in the fragile karst region should, therefore, continue.

AB  - To determine sequestration rates of carbon dioxide (CO2) we calculated the carbon (C) storage rate in humus layers of Swedish forests with Podsolic soils, which account for 14.2 x 10(6) ha of the 22.7 x 10(6) ha of forested land in Sweden. Our data set covered 41 years of humus inventories and mean humus layer thickness in 82 513 plots. We analysed three forest types: (i) all combinations of tree species, (ii) forests dominated (>70%) by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and (iii) forests dominated (>70%) by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). To relate changes in humus layer thickness to land area we used the intersections in 25 km x 25 km grids and used kriging interpolation, permitting calculations for each forest type. For each intersection mean humus thickness for each year was calculated and regressed against time to obtain the rate of change. This rate, humus bulk density, and humus C concentration were used to calculate sequestration rates. The mean sequestration rate was 251 kg C.ha(-1).year(-1), which is higher than theoretical values. The sequestration rate was positively related to temperature sum, albeit including effects of forest management. The pine-dominated forest type had a mean rate of 283 kg C.ha(-1).year(-1), and the spruce-dominated had a mean rate of 239 kg C.ha(-1).year(-1). Under similar site conditions, pine sequestered more C than spruce (difference of 71 kg C.ha(-1).year(-1); p < 0.0001), showing the importance of this type of ecosystem for C sequestration.

AB  - Habitat specificity indices reflect richness (alpha) and/or distinctiveness (beta) components of diversity. The latter may be defined by alpha and gamma (landscape) diversity in two alternative ways: multiplicatively ( beta = gamma/alpha ) and additively ( beta = gamma - alpha). We demonstrate that the original habitat specificity concept of Wagner and Edwards (Landscape Ecol 16:121-131, 2001) consists of three independent components: core habitat specificity (uniqueness of the species composition), patch area and patch species richness. We describe habitat specificity as a family of indices that may include either area or richness components, or none or both, and open for use of different types of mean in calculation of core habitat specificity. Core habitat specificity is a beta diversity measure: the effective number of completely distinct communities in the landscape. Habitat specificity weighted by species number is a gamma diversity measure: the effective number of species that a patch contributes to landscape richness. We compared 12 habitat specificity indices by theoretical reasoning and by use of field data (vascular plant species in SE Norwegian agricultural landscapes). Habitat specificity indices are strongly influenced by weights for patch area and patch species richness, and the relative contribution of rare vs. common species (type of mean). The relevance of properties emphasized by each habitat specificity index for evaluation of patches in a biodiversity context is discussed. Core habitat specificity is emphasized as an ecologically interpretable measure that specifically addresses patch uniqueness while habitat specificity weighted by species number combines species richness and species composition in ways relevant for conservation biological assessment.

AB  - Peatlands provide habitats for many species and a variety of ecosystem services worldwide. In this study we used an integrated biophysical-economic modeling approach with multi-objective optimization to investigate how alternative land-use and land-management (LULM) options jointly affect economic returns from marketed (timber, energy peat, restoration costs) and non-marketed public goods (water quality, GHG emissions, biodiversity) in a typical landscape dominated by peatlands in northern Finland. We considered several LULM options including no action (the current state will continue), bioenergy wood harvesting, intensive forest management, restoration, and energy peat extraction with three after use options (no after use, reforestation, rewetting). Our study revealed strong tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services in drained peatlands. Optimal LULM depended strongly on the chosen objectives, i.e. whether marketed or non-marketed goods were preferred. For example, when the objective was carbon neutral land-use, the no action option was mostly chosen, while bioenergy wood harvesting was mostly chosen when the objective was to provide economic and environmental benefits at the same time. The strong tradeoff between biodiversity and ecosystem services indicates that compromises are unavoidable in order to obtain a multi-functional landscape which provides biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and water protection in a cost-effective manner.

AB  - Boreal forests form the largest and least disturbed forest biome in the northern hemisphere. However, anthropogenic pressure from intensified forest management, eutrophication, and climate change may alter the ecosystem functions of understory vegetation and services boreal forests provide. Swedish forests span long gradients of climate, nitrogen deposition, and management intensity. This makes them ideal to study how the species composition and functions of other, more pristine, boreal forests might change under increased anthropogenic pressure. Moreover, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) has collected systematic data on Swedish forest vegetation since the mid-20th century. We use this data to quantify changes in vegetation types between two periods, 1953-1962 and 2003-2012. The results show changes in forest understory vegetation since the 1950s at scales not previously documented in the boreal biome. The spatial extent of most vegetation types changed significantly. Shade-adapted and nutrient-demanding species (those with high specific leaf area) have become more common at the expense of light-demanding and nutrient-conservative (low specific leaf area) species. The cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs decreased dramatically. These effects were strongest where anthropogenic impacts were greatest, suggesting links to drivers such as nitrogen deposition and land-use change. These changes may impact ecosystem functions and services via effects on higher trophic levels and faster plant litter decomposition in the expanding vegetation types. This, in turn, may influence nutrient dynamics, and consequently ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.

AB  - This study deals with changes in the plant cover and its net carbon sequestration over 30 years on a subarctic Sphagnum-mire with permafrost near Abisko, northernmost Sweden, in relation to climatic variations during the same period. Aerial colour infrared images from 1970 and 2000 were compared to reveal changes in surface structure and vegetation over the whole mire, while the plant populations were studied within a smaller, mainly ombrotrophic part. The results demonstrated two processes, namely (1) that wet sites dominated by graminoids expanded while hummock sites dominated by dwarf shrubs receded, and (2) that on the hummocks lichens expanded while evergreen dwarf shrubs and mosses decreased, both processes creating an instability in the surface structure. A successive degradation of the permafrost is the likely reason for the increase in wet areas, while the changes in the hummock vegetation might have resulted from higher spring temperatures giving rise to an intensified snow melt, exposing the vegetation to frost drought. Because of the vegetation changes, the annual litter input of carbon to the mire has increased slightly, by 4 g m(-2) a(-1) (7.3%), over these years while an increased erosion has resulted in a loss of 40-80 Mg carbon or 7-17 g m(-2) a(-1) for the entire mire over the same period. As the recalcitrant proportion of the litter has decreased, the decay rate in the acrotelm might be expected to increase in the future.

AB  - Mixed-species forests can have higher productivity, in terms of wood volume, than monospecific forests. In addition, higher tree species richness has been found to positively correlate with multiple ecosystem services and functions. Surprisingly, stem quality as one of the most important factors regarding the economic value of forests has rarely been formally studied in diverse forests. This paper aims at investigating how tree species richness influences stem quality and which factors may drive quality development in these stands. Stem quality, understood here essentially as the suitability of a particular stem for particular end-uses, is influenced by a tree's ability to capture sufficient resources for growth and is influenced by neighbouring trees, e.g. through shading and physical crown interactions. We collected data on crown size, stem form and tree health for over 12,000 trees in 209 study plots in six European regions (Finland, Germany, Poland, Romania, Italy and Spain) within naturally diverse forests to assess the impact of tree species richness on these characteristics. Results showed that quality variability between regions, stands and individual trees was high across species. At the stand level, there was a slight tendency towards lower stem quality with increasing diversity. However, individual trees of high quality were present at all diversity levels and for all target species. Tree species richness could not be confirmed as a primary influence on stem quality at the stand level. Rather, stand and individual tree properties such as structural composition, competition, tree size and crown characteristics were identified as the main factors for stem quality development, even in mixed stands. Many of the factors identified in this study can be directly or indirectly influenced by forest management strategies tailored to produce high-quality timber in mixed-species forests. Our findings suggest that diverse stands are not inferior regarding stem quality, while at the same time being able to provide various other ecosystem services.

AB  - The salmon industry is heavily dependent on wrasse for delousing infected fish. The goldsinny wrasse is numerically the most important, and each year, millions are harvested from the wild and transported large distances into fish farms. Population genetic knowledge is required to sustainably exploit this species. Here, 1051 goldsinny wrasses from 16 locations across Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Spain were genotyped with 14 microsatellite and 36 SNP markers. Within-population genetic diversity decreased towards north, and a genetic break was observed across the North Sea. Samples from Northern Norway differed from rest of the Scandinavian samples, and samples from the British Isles differed from the Spanish ones. Within Scandinavia, isolation-by-distance was detected. Observed genetic patterns fitted well with expectations derived from oceanographic drift simulations. A sample from mid-Norway deviated from these patterns however, and was genetically very similar to southern Scandinavian samples. We conclude that the population structure of this species is primarily determined by the opposing evolutionary forces of passive drift, limited adult migration and spawning-site fidelity, whereas the deviation in isolation-by-distance observed in mid-Norway is potentially caused by inadvertent translocations of wrasse from southern Scandinavia via current aquaculture practise. Inclusion of outlier loci gave greater resolution, suggesting that diversifying selection may also affect population structuring among goldsinny wrasses.

AB  - Different types of dead wood in forest ecosystems contribute to an increase of habitats for decomposer fungi. This may have a positive effect on fungal diversity but may also increase habitats for tree pathogens. In this study we investigate the fungal diversity and composition via high-throughput sequencing in decaying stumps and logs (three years after cutting) of two tree species (Larix kaempferi and Quercus rubra) in a forest site.
   Fungal diversity and composition in decaying wood was different between tree species, between stumps and logs of the same tree species, and between sapwood and heartwood. When different wood sources were combined, fungal species diversity increased. This indicates that different wood sources contribute to fungal diversity and, therefore, species conservation in forests.
   Potential fungal tree pathogens were found in L. kaempferi stumps and logs, whereas their occurrence was generally less in Q. rubra wood sources. No clear difference was found in the relative abundance of potential fungal tree pathogens between stumps and logs, but some potential tree pathogens were only found in either stumps or logs. This indicates that both logs and stumps can be habitats for potential fungal tree pathogens, and each wood type seems to harbor different fungal tree pathogens.
   In conclusion, forest management practices that aim at maintaining different types of dead wood seem to positively affect fungal diversity, but may additionally increase the risk of survival of potential tree pathogens. This potential risk seems to depend on the tree species.

AB  - Using a mathematical programming model of Norwegian agriculture, we explore interconnections between trade liberalization and reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We show that the Doha Round proposals for a new agreement on agriculture through the World Trade Organization would not generate significant reductions in emissions. Further trade liberalization would reduce emissions by cutting agricultural production but would not change production methods. Imposing a carbon tax would lead both to a reduction in output and the extensification of production. In contrast, if farmers are allowed to claim a credit for carbon sequestration the effect is to intensify agricultural production.

AB  - Marine cobble habitats in shallow waters are rich in faunal assemblages and known settling grounds for valuable fishery resources such as lobsters and crabs. Sampling these grounds is challenging as traditional techniques do not efficiently collect fast-moving benthic invertebrates. Typically, fast moving crustaceans are not sampled according to actual densities. This study used airlift suction sampling, pioneered in North America, to quantify benthic faunal assemblages in cobble grounds across 68 sampling locations in south-western Norway. In total, 72 species of benthic invertebrates (5276 individual specimens) were identified, with an overall sampling efficiency of 76.4%. Polychaeta and decapod crustaceans dominated the samples, with species diversity (Shannon Index, H') highest in Location 3. Cluster and Ordination analyses were further used to relate assemblages to a number of selected variables. Overall, the study highlights that suction sampling provides a low-cost and efficient method for quantifying mobile benthic fauna in structurally complex marine habitats (i.e., cobble).

AB  - The conversion from pure coniferous stands to mixed forests is a major goal of forest management strategies in the light of climate change. However, the effects of forest conversion on the associated species diversity and the factors driving diversity changes remain poorly understood. To investigate these effects, we established 54 plots in a managed forest in southern Germany, where large areas have been converted from pure spruce to mixed spruce-beech stands since the middle of the 20th century. Our sampling plots consisted of three different age classes and increasing proportions of beech, measured by the number of stems. We sampled fungi, plants, in-vertebrates, and birds and combined classical methods (identification by specialists) and metabarcoding for species identification. Furthermore, important forest structure and site parameters were recorded to test their influence on species alpha and beta diversity. Alpha diversity of embryophytes, and therein tracheophytes, increased with increasing availability of light, whereas fungi decreased. With increasing humus thickness alpha diversity of insects, especially dipterans and hymenopterans increased, whereas embryophytes, tracheophytes and fungi decreased. Increasing numbers of habitat trees increased the alpha diversity overall, especially in tracheophytes and hymenopterans. The proportion of beech determined the alpha diversity of one out of 12 taxa and influenced the beta diversity of 10 from 12 taxa. However, factors influencing the diversity are taxa dependent. Our study indicates that the proportion of beech had less impact on alpha diversity but impacts beta diversity. Changes in forest structures and environmental conditions occurring during forest conversion are as important as the introduction of beech for alpha and beta diversity.

AB  - (1) The effect of disturbance on diversity patterns of cryptogams has received little attention.  We compared bryophyte diversity in thirty-seven patches formed by uprooting with that of the undisturbed forest floor in a north Swedish Picea abies forest.
   (2) Bryophyte diversity and species richness were significantly higher in patches with soil disturbance compared with undisturbed forest floor.  Species richness and diversity were highest at intermediate patch ages, but disturbed patches had an altered vegetation composition for at least 100 years.
   (3) Four causes of high bryophyte diversity in disturbed patches are proposed:  (i) uprooting creates space for bryophyte colonization that is free from potential competitors; (ii) disturbed patches have high habitat heterogeneity; (iii) within-patch disturbance continues long after patch formation through erosion from tip-up mound; and (iv) the small patch size implies a short distance to potential sources of bryophyte diaspores which should increase the chance of establishment.
   (4) Both early and late successional bryophytes establish shortly after an uprooting has occurred.  This suggests that no facilitation by early species is necessary before late successional species invade.
   (5) Results show that treefall disturbances are important for both the persistence of colonists and the maintenance of high bryophyte diversity in boreal-forest ecosystems.  Consequently, the studied system has clear parallels with the gap-phase systems widely recognized in temperate and tropical forests.

AB  - Captured CO2 from large industrial emitters may be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but as of yet there are no European large-scale EOR systems. Recent implementation decisions for a Norwegian carbon capture and storage demonstration will result in the establishment of a central CO2 hub on the west-coast of Norway and storage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development may continue towards a large-scale operation involving European CO2 and CO2 EOR operation. To this end, a conceptual EOR system was developed here based on an oxyfuel power plant located in Poland that acted as a source for CO2, coupled to a promising oil field located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Lifecycle assessment was subsequently used to estimate environmental emissions indicators. When averaged over the operational lifetime, results show greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.4 kg CO2-eq per kg oil (and n kWh associated electricity) produced, of which 64 % derived from the oxyfuel power plant. This represents a 71 % emission reduction when compared to the same amount of oil and electricity production using conventional technology. Other environmental impact indicators were increased, showing that this type of CO2 EOR system may help reach GHG reduction targets, but care should be taken to avoid problem shifting.

AB  - Changes of agricultural practices have led to decline of semi-natural habitats sustained by traditional animal husbandry in many European regions. The abandonment of semi-natural pastures leads to increase of vascular plant biomass and subsequent decline of weak competitors such as bryophytes. Re-establishing traditional animal husbandry may potentially restore biodiversity but the success of such measures remains insufficiently known. In this study, we asked if re-establishing cattle grazing on previously abandoned grasslands will restore their bryophyte communities. The effect of cattle grazing on bryophyte communities of mesic semi-natural grasslands was studied in south-western Finland in a comparison of (i) continuously grazed pastures, (ii) previously abandoned pastures where grazing was re-established during 1990s, and (iii) abandoned pastures, where grazing had ceased during late 1960s to early 1980s. The average cover, species richness, species density and species diversity of bryophytes were significantly higher in the continuously grazed than in the abandoned grasslands. Ordination analyses revealed clear differences also in community structure between the management classes. Re-established grasslands were ecologically heterogeneous and situated in between the continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in all characteristics, indicating variable effect of the restoration measure. Seventeen bryophyte species were recognized as significant indicators of the three grassland classes, four of which could be used as indicators of valuable grassland habitats. Although there was variation in the consequences of re-introduction of grazing, the results give evidence of positive effect of grazing on regaining bryophyte diversity of abandoned grasslands.

AB  - This paper examines the implications of imposing a climate tax on food consumption in Sweden combined with refunding of the tax revenues to farmers for selected agricultural activities enhancing ecosystem services: restoration of drained peatland (carbon sequestration), maintenance of grassland (biodiversity), and construction of wetlands (nutrient regulation). A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits.

AB  - The rehabilitation and restoration of land is a key strategy to recover services - goods and resources-ecosystems offer to the humankind. This paper reviews key examples to understand the superior effect of nature based solutions to enhance the sustainability of catchment systems by promoting desirable soil and landscape functions. The use of concepts such as connectivity and the theory of system thinking framework allowed to review coastal and river management as a guide to evaluate other strategies to achieve sustainability. In land management NBSs are not mainstream management. Through a set of case studies: organic farming in Spain; rewilding in Slovenia; land restoration in Iceland, sediment trapping in Ethiopia and wetland construction in Sweden, we show the potential of Nature based solutions (NBSs) as a cost-effective long term solution for hydrological risks and land degradation. NBSs can be divided into two main groups of strategies: soil solutions and landscape solutions. Soil solutions aim to enhance the soil health and soil functions through which local eco-system services will bemaintained or restored. Landscape solutions mainly focus on the concept of connectivity. Making the landscape less connected, facilitating less rainfall to be transformed into runoff and therefore reducing flood risk, increasing soilmoisture and reducing droughts and soil erosionwe can achieve the sustainability. The enhanced eco-system services directly feed into the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of management practices on forest ecosystems is usually analyzed by a comparison of species composition and richness. Different types of management practices increase plant species richness, mainly due to an increase in the number of ruderal and open habitat species. So far, most of the studies have been performed in the forest types that were most common in the studied regions. In this study we focused on broadleaved ravine forests that are spatially limited to specific habitat conditions, including steep rocky slopes with skeletal soil and unstable ground. These forests are local biodiversity hotspots, and, due to limited accessibility, have been subject to only limited management practices, mainly removal of single trees.
   We collected a dataset of 215 plots sampled between 1991 and 2015 in both managed forests and protected areas. We used multivariate techniques to compare the differences in the overall species composition. In addition, we compared differences in diversity, structural and habitat indices to find any possible differences. There were no differences in both the plot level and accumulative species richness and diversity indices between protected and managed forests. In addition, a comparison of habitat conditions and different ecological groups, including ruderal and open habitat species, alien species and ancient forest indicator species also revealed no differences. The only significant differences between the protected and managed forests related to the evenness and shrub cover.
   We concluded that low intensity forest management in ravine forests resembles natural disturbances, which are characteristic of natural ravine forests. The species composing these communities are adapted to frequent natural disturbances and thus forest management did not influence significant habitat conditions. However, to fully understand the effect of these practices on biodiversity, a comparison of structural characteristics is needed.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and income generation are competing objectives in modern forest management. The climate commitments of many countries depend on forests as carbon sinks which must be quantified, monitored, and projected into the future. For projections we need tools to model forest development and perform scenario analyses to assess future carbon sequestration potentials under different management regimes, the expected net present value of such regimes, and possible impacts of climate change. We propose a scenario analysis software tool (GAYA 2.0) that can assist in answering these types of questions using stand level simulations, detailed carbon flow models and an optimizer. This paper has two objectives: (1) to describe GAYA 2.0, and (2) demonstrate its potential in a case study where we analyze the forest carbon balance over a region in Norway based on national forest inventory sample plots. The tool was used to map the optimality front between the carbon benefit and net present value. We observed changes in net present value for different levels of carbon benefit as well as changes in optimal management strategies. We predicted future changes in several forest carbon pools as well as albedo and illustrated the impact of gradual increase in forest productivity (i.e., due to climate warming). Having been updated and modernized from its previous version with increased attention to forest carbon and energy fluxes, GAYA 2.0 is an effective tool that offers multiple opportunities to perform various types of scenario analyses in forest management.

AB  - In Europe, warming, droughts and the rise of extreme climate events have an increasing significant negative effect on forest stands. Therefore, it is necessary to create appropriate adaptation strategies of silviculture to mitigate the impacts of global climate change on forest ecosystem s in Central Europe. The objectives of this paper were to evaluate stand production, structure and diversity on eight experimental research plots in the Krkonose Mountains. Subsequently, three variants of management were compared in mixed stands at the age of 17 - 20 years originating from natural regeneration: A) control variant (stands before thinning), B) applied newly designed thinning in the context of climate change adaptation and C) simulative thinning from below. Number of trees decreased from 3,256 trees ha(-1) by 32% after adaptation thinning and by 36% after thinning from below. The basal area decreased in variant B by 22% and in variant C by 12%. Structural diversity and tree species richness increased after application of adaptation thinning, while decrease of diameter differentiation and total diversity was observed after thinning from below. Moreover, horizontal structure changed from aggregated spatial pattern to random distribution after the interventions, especially under adaptation thinning. The newly designed structuralizing adaptation thinning method seems to be a more suitable option in given habitat and stand conditions compared to the commonly performed thinning from below. In future, this issue will certainly require further close cooperation of forestry experts in order to arrive at optimal variants of solutions differentiated according to specific conditions.

AB  - Through spatially explicit predictive models, knowledge of spatial patterns of biota can be generated for out-of-reach environments, where there is a paucity of survey data. This knowledge is invaluable for conservation decisions. We used distribution modeling to predict the occurrence of benthic biotopes, or megafaunal communities of the seabed, to support the spatial planning of a marine national park. Nine biotope classes were obtained prior to modeling from multivariate species data derived from point source, underwater imagery. Five map layers relating to depth and terrain were used as predictor variables. Biotope type was predicted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, where pixel size was 15315 m and total modeled area was 455 km(2).
   To choose a suitable modeling technique we compared the performance of five common models based on recursive partitioning: two types of classification and regression trees ([1] pruned by 10-fold cross-validation and [2] pruned by minimizing complexity), random forests, conditional inference (CI) trees, and CI forests. The selected model was a CI forest (an ensemble of CI trees), a machine-learning technique whose discriminatory power (class-byclass area under the curve [AUC] ranged from 0.75 to 0.86) and classification accuracy (72%) surpassed those of the other methods tested. Conditional inference trees are virtually new to the field of ecology. The final model's overall prediction error was 28%. Model predictions were also checked against a custom-built measure of dubiousness, calculated at the polygon level. Key factors other than the choice of modeling technique include: the use of a multinomial response, accounting for the heterogeneity of observations, and spatial autocorrelation. To illustrate how the model results can be implemented in spatial planning, representation of biodiversity in the national park was described and quantified.
   Given a goal of maximizing classification accuracy, we conclude that conditional inference trees are a promising tool to map biota. Species distribution modeling is presented as an ecological tool that can handle a wide variety of systems (e.g., the benthic system).

AB  - Protection of nature for biodiversity, and for the material livelihoods of Indigenous peoples, have much in common. Indigenous relations to nature are, however, based on unity between use and protection, implying that human use is necessary for effective protection. Often protected areas include the homelands of Indigenous peoples, whose needs and rights are still being ignored to a large extent. This paper explores the effects of a plan for a significant increase of large nature protection areas in Norway, still under implementation. Most of the new protection areas are in the heartland of the Indigenous Sami, whose core livelihood is reindeer management. The plan implies transfer of jurisdiction from Indigenous and local domains to formalised central domains. In several cases, this has provoked Indigenous and rural groups to organised resistance. In this case study, there are signs of new tensions between Sami and other rural groups. Indigenous land use can be marginalised by park restrictions and increasing pressure from visitor activity. The Sami response was to boycott the park management board leading to a stalemate. A robust solution seems to require consideration of deeper institutional levels.

AB  - For the last several decades, native broad- leafed forests in many areas of south China have been converted into plantations of more productive forest species for timber use. This paper presents a case study examining how this forest conversion affects ecosystem carbon storage by comparing 33 year- old plantations of two coniferous trees, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata, CF) and Fokienia hodginsii (FH) and two broadleaved trees, Ormosia xylocarpa (OX) and Castanopsis kawakamii (CK), with an adjacent relict natural forest of Castanopsis kawakamii (NF, similar to 150 year old) in Sanming, Fujian, China. Overall estimates of total ecosystem carbon pools ranged from a maximum of 399.1 Mg ha(-1) in the NF to a minimum of 210.6 Mg ha(-1) in the FH. The combined tree carbon pool was at a maximum in the NF where it contributed 64% of the total ecosystem pool, while the OX had the lowest contribution by trees at only 49%. Differences were also observed for the carbon pools of undergrowth, forest floor and standing dead wood, but that these pools together represent at the most 5% of the ecosystem C stock. Total C storage in the surface 100 cm soils ranged from 123.9 Mg ha(-1) in the NF to 102.3 Mg ha(-1) in the FH. Significant differences (P < 0.01) in SOC concentrations and storage between native forest and the plantations were limited to the surface soils (0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm), while no significant difference was found among the plantations at any soil depth (P > 0.05). Annual aboveground litterfall C ranged from 4.51 Mg ha(-1) in the CK to 2.15 Mg ha(-1) in the CF, and annual belowground litterfall (root mortality) C ranged from 4.35 Mg ha(-1) in the NF to 1.25 Mg ha(-1) in the CF. When the NF was converted into tree plantations, the vegetation C pool (tree plus undergrowth) was reduced by 27 - 59%, and the detritus C pool (forest floor, standing dead wood, and soils) reduced by 20 - 25%, respectively. These differences between the NF and the plantations may be attributed to a combination of factors including more diverse species communities, more C store types, higher quantity and better quality of above- and belowground litter materials under the NF than under the plantations and site disturbance during the establishment of plantations.

AB  - We estimate the climate effects of directing forest management in Sweden towards increased carbon storage in forests with more land set-aside for protection, or towards increased forest production for the substitution of carbon-intensive materials and fossil fuels, relative to a reference case of current forest management. We develop various scenarios of forest management and biomass use to estimate the carbon balances of the forest systems, including ecological and technological components, and their impacts on the climate in terms of radiative forcing. The scenario with increased set-aside area and the current level of forest residue harvest resulted in lower cumulative carbon emissions compared to the reference case for the first 90 years, but then showed higher emissions as reduced forest harvest led to higher carbon emissions from energy and material systems. For the reference case of current forest management, increased harvest of forest residues gave increased climate benefits. The most climatically beneficial alternative, expressed as reduced cumulative radiative forcing, in both the short and long terms is a strategy aimed at.high forest production, high residue recovery rate, and high efficiency utilization of harvested biomass. Active forest management with high harvest levels and efficient forest product utilization will provide more climate benefit, compared to reducing harvest and storing more carbon in the forest.

AB  - Stand productivity research has mainly focused on increasing yield and has recently begun to examine changes in carbon storage. The Korean government is interested in finding ways to increase forest carbon capture to meet carbon neutrality requirements because approximately 63% of the land is covered by forests. In addition, 69% of these forests are older than 30 years old and their productivity and aboveground carbon storage rates are expected to decline. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of quadratic mean diameter (QMD), stand basal area, site index, slope, climate (MAT and MAP), stand age, stand structural diversity, and stand composition on the productivity of aging Korean red pine-dominated stands. Based on the effects of these factors, we explored how to manage pine forests with the focus of increasing their productivity. Random forest regression was used for the analysis, and periodic basal area increment (PBAI) was used as the dependent variable of stand productivity. Our results show that the most influential factor on stand productivity was QMD. PBAI dramatically decreased from approximately 0.8 to 0.53 m2/ha.year as QMD increased up to 18 cm. Since diameter (QMD) increment is closely associated with changes in tree competition; increasing tree competition with increasing QMD and stand basal area may lead to decreases in PBAI owing to decreases in growth rate due to space and resource limitations and increases in mortality. PBAI decreased when basal area increased from 22 to 51.5 m2/ ha. PBAI increased for site index values between 8 and 12.5 m and decreased for stand age values up to approximately 31 years. For climate factors, PBAI generally increased with increasing MAP and slightly increased as MAT increased up to approximately 11.2 degrees C and then decreased at higher MAT. PBAI initially increased with increasing slope values, decreased with values lower than 15 degrees, and remained stable at slope values in the range of 16-34 degrees. Stand structural diversity, which ranged from 1.32 to 1.62, exhibited a similar negative influence on PBAI associated with increasing stand density. With regard to pine composition, pine stands with a large proportion of pine basal area, showed higher productivity due to the simple stand structure resulting in better growth of shade intolerant pine. This study found that stand density increases with the development of pine stands and that density increases had negative influences on stand productivity. Collectively, our results suggest that stand density management is essential for increasing stand productivity and carbon sequestration in the Korean red pine-dominated stands of South Korea.

AB  - A soil disturbance experiment was performed during two seasons in degraded, calcareous sandy grassland in southern Sweden. pH, extractable phosphorus, plant species richness and vegetation composition were analyzed. Mechanical soil disturbance had no effect on pH, and caused only a minor increase in extractable phosphorus. Positive effects compared to control plots were seen on plot scale (360 m(2)) in species richness and Shannon index 2 years after treatment, while on a smaller scale (1 m(2)), species richness increased only in rotavated plots. Plant community differences were mainly found between disturbed and control plots, and some positive effects were detected on early establishing species, but the two disturbance techniques favored different species. It is concluded that mechanical soil disturbance, and a variation in techniques and intensities, may be an important measure for preserving diversity in grasslands that have a history of mechanical soil disturbance.

AB  - Light availability and its variation have an impact on underwater vegetation. To study the impact at the macrophyte community level, we combined information from underwater vegetation inventories to in situ measured depth profiles of photosynthetically active radiation. The data were collected from the Baltic Sea archipelago of south-western Finland during the growing season in 2010. While macrophyte coverage was well explained by light variables in variance partitioning, the explained proportions were notably lower for both the species number and floristic similarity index. Light variables better explained the coverage of annual than perennial macrophytes, and from the algae groups, the green algae reached the highest explained proportion. As well as confirming that light availability has an important role in regulating the macrophyte growth density in the euphotic zone, our results further indicate that intra-seasonal variability in light availability affects the macrophyte community structure.

AB  - Forestry as a large industry has significant impacts on the quality of forest landscapes in boreal forests. In Finland, the rapid growth of nature-based tourism has expanded tourism and outdoor recreation activities from protected areas into commercial forests, especially in northern Finland. This has created demands to modify current forest management regimes, in particular regeneration practices. As the landscape and recreational benefits of forests mainly represent direct and indirect use values, there may be a case for a direct contractual mechanism of payments between the users (e.g. tourism entrepreneurs) and providers (forest owners). This paper presents the key results of a choice experiment study analyzing domestic and foreign tourists' demand for and willingness to pay for enhanced forest amenities, in particular landscape values and biodiversity, in private forests in the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area in northeastern Finland. The results support the idea that tourists are willing to pay for selected improvements in the quality of outdoor recreation environments through adjustments in forest management in the case study area. Both foreign and domestic tourists were willing to pay for improvements in forest landscape, in terms of less frequent clear-cutting and site preparation areas along the routes, as well as for increased biodiversity. Foreign tourists' willingness to pay was significantly higher than domestic tourists'. Neither group would pay for extended outdoor recreation routes or increased carbon sequestration, even though reductions in these services would mean a welfare loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We used an extensive dataset (1220 vegetation plots of 1 m(2)) to study vegetation gradients and fine-scale plant diversity in dry calcareous grasslands (including alvar grasslands) in the Baltic Sea region. The study area covers the entire European distributional range of alvar habitats: Sweden (Oland, Gotland, Gotaland), Estonia (Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, north Estonia, west Estonia), and western Russia (Izhora, lzborsk). Fine-scale plant diversity was characterized by species richness and standardized phylogenetic diversity (comparing the observed mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD) with MPD values from random communities). Ordination techniques (DCA) were used to characterize the main vegetation gradient. Variables describing local environment, climate, the biogeographic composition of the plant communities, and geographic location were related to fine-scale species richness and phylogenetic diversity using variation partitioning techniques and linear mixed models.
   The main vegetation gradient in the dry calcareous grasslands in the Baltic Sea region had a strong geographic component, was associated with soil depth, species' stress- and disturbance-tolerance and the age of the grassland habitat.
   Fine-scale phylogenetic diversity and species richness were negatively associated suggesting that these two diversity components are influenced by different sets of environmental and historical parameters. Fine-scale species richness was unimodally associated with the main vegetation gradient, and the highest levels of species richness were found under intermediate environmental (disturbance, light conditions and temperature) conditions where there was a mixture of species from different biogeographic regions. In contrast to species richness, fine-scale phylogenetic diversity was negatively associated with the main vegetation gradient. The highest phylogenetic diversity was found in the extremely thin-soiled alvar grasslands in Gotaland and on the Baltic islands (especially on Oland) where the high phylogenetic diversity is likely to be a reflection of a long history of continuous openness that has allowed time for the "collection" of phylogenetically different species within these unique habitats.

AB  - This study investigates the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in Tarfala Valley, northern Sweden. Field inventories, upscaled based on land cover, show that this alpine permafrost environment does not store large amounts of SOC, with an estimate mean of 0.9 +/- 0.2 kg C m(-2) for the upper meter of soil. This is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than what has been reported for lowland permafrost terrain. The SOC storage varies for different land cover classes and ranges from 0.05 kg C m(-2) for stone-dominated to 8.4 kg C m(-2) for grass-dominated areas. No signs of organic matter burial through cryoturbation or slope processes were found, and radiocarbon-dated SOC is generally of recent origin (< 2000 cal yr BP). An inventory of permafrost distribution in Tarfala Valley, based on the bottom temperature of snow measurements and a logistic regression model, showed that at an altitude where permafrost is probable the SOC storage is very low. In the high-altitude permafrost zones (above 1500 m), soils store only ca. 0.1 kg C m(-2). Under future climate warming, an upward shift of vegetation zones may lead to a net ecosystem C uptake from increased biomass and soil development. As a consequence, alpine permafrost environments could act as a net carbon sink in the future, as there is no loss of older or deeper SOC from thawing permafrost.

AB  - If colonization of empty habitat patches causes genetic bottlenecks, freshly founded, young populations should be genetically less diverse than older ones that may have experienced successive rounds of immigration. This can be studied in metapopulations with subpopulations of known age. We studied allozyme variation in metapopulations of two species of water fleas (Daphnia) in the skerry archipelago of southern Finland. These populations have been monitored since 1982. Screening 49 populations of D. longispina and 77 populations of D. magna, separated by distances of 1.5-2180 m, we found that local genetic diversity increased with population age whereas pairwise differentiation among pools decreased with population age. These patterns persisted even after controlling for several potentially confounding ecological variables, indicating that extinction and recolonization dynamics decrease local genetic diversity and increase genetic differentiation in these metapopulations by causing genetic bottlenecks during colonization. We suggest that the effect of these bottlenecks may be twofold, namely decreasing genetic diversity by random sampling and leading to population-wide inbreeding. Subsequent immigration then may not only introduce new genetic material, but also lead to the production of noninbred hybrids, selection for which may cause immigrant alleles to increase in frequency, thus leading to increased genetic diversity in older populations.

AB  - Managing and regulating aquaculture is a complicated issue. From the perspective of fish farmers as well as regulators managing aquaculture can be regarded as what political scientists refer to as a wicked problem. This is because there is a great extent of uncertainty and lack of firm knowledge with respect to the externalities of aquaculture production; e.g., diseases, environmental impacts, and conflicts with other user interests. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the aquaculture sector contributes to the uncertainty as new solutions emerge, rendering established knowledge obsolete or irrelevant. Designing appropriate public regulations and policy measures is thus important, but difficult. Based on empirical data from Norway, we investigate what respondents from public agencies and the industry perceive to be challenges in governing aquaculture and what we may infer on the characteristics of a good governance approach. We propose that such an approach needs to focus on building competence, collaboration, and be adaptable. Furthermore, it needs to be flexible and cost efficient.

AB  - As cities grow, urban greenspace assumes a more central role in the provision of ecosystem services (ESS). Many ecosystem services depend on the interactions of soil-plant systems, with the quantity and quality of services affected by plant type and age. The question, however, remains whether urban greenspace can be included in the same ecological framework as non-urban greenspace. Our previous studies have contributed towards filling this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of plant functional type (evergreen trees, deciduous trees and lawn) and plant age on soil characteristics and functionality in urban greenspace, offering also a comparison with non-urban greenspace. A total of 41 urban parks and five non-urban forest sites within and adjacent to the cities of Helsinki and Lahti (Finland) were included in this project. Path analyses presented in this contribution, combined with a synthesis of previous findings, offer strong evidence that urban greenspace functions similarly to non-urban greenspace. In particular, plant functional types lead to soil environmental modifications similar to those in non-urban ecosystems. Therefore, vegetation choice upon park construction/implementation can improve the quality and quantity of ESS provided by urban greenspace. However, although vegetation modifies urban greenspace soils with time in a fashion similar to non-urban greenspace, the vegetation type effect is greater in non-urban greenspaces. To conclude, our synthesis of previous studies provides science-based guidance for urban planners who aim to optimize ESS in urban greenspaces.

AB  - Restoration is important for biodiversity conservation worldwide, but surprisingly little is known about its efficiency in a long-term perspective. In this study, we re-examined Swedish semi-natural grasslands 12-20 years after the restoration, by comparing field inventories of vascular plant species diversity made in 2001 with follow-up inventories in 2012. We also analysed restoration effect in relation to six environmental factors and used continuously managed semi-natural grasslands as references of desired state after restoration. We found that total species richness increased over time but not to reference levels, while there were no significant changes in species density or number of grassland specialists. However, the overall species composition in the restored sites, as well as grassland specialist composition, now largely resembled reference conditions. Fertilisation and time between abandonment and restoration were the only environmental variables that affected total species composition change, while site area affected change in grassland specialist composition. Our results show that restoration of semi-natural grasslands can contribute to conservation of semi-natural habitats and their associated biodiversity. Yet, due to the vague restoration goals for these sites, it is difficult to evaluate the restoration success, which emphasise the general need for clear and measurable goals.

AB  - We asked whether assemblages of species with separate evolutionary histories differed in their response to similar human interventions. We assessed this by comparing the response of riparian plant communities to river regulation on two different continents. We compared free-flowing and regulated rivers between boreal parts of North America (Alberta and British Columbia) and Europe (Sweden), using a standardized Sampling protocol and the same field staff on both continents. Although the two regions shared few species, both riparian plant-species diversity along free-flowing rivers and the response to different kinds of flow regulation were similar between the continents. The number of riparian-plant species and their amount of cover differed among types of water-level regime, but the continental affiliation of a river-margin site did not statistically explain any of the variation. Within continents, the local flora of the regulated river-margin sites was largely similar in species composition to the free-flowing ones, but the sites along storage reservoirs were more species-poor. The similarity in the response to regulation between the continents suggests that general guidelines for rehabilitation of degraded boreal rivers are. a realistic goal.
   The number of species and genera, plant cover, and species numbers in most trait groups (classified according to growth form and life span) were similar between free-flowing river margins in Europe and North America. Moreover, the regional native species pools of northern Sweden and Alberta were similar in size and composition of species groups, despite the fact that only 27% of the species in Alberta were found in northern Sweden. This is presumably because the floras share a common Tertiary origin and because the regions have had largely similar late-Tertiary and Quaternary histories. The most pronounced difference between the continents was that we found no exotic species on the 183 Swedish river margin sites, whereas 9% of the species found in all 24 North American plots taken together were exotics. All North American exotics found have occurred in Europe since prehistoric times, and the difference in exotic richness most likely reflects a difference in the number of species humans have transferred from one continent to another, rather than a difference in invasibility between the regions.

AB  - Lythrum salicaria L., a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and Asia, is recognized as an aggressive invasive species of North America wetlands. In this paper, 26 invasive and 32 native populations of L. salicaria were compared in terms of their growing habitats (native populations in Trebon Biosphere Reserve - South Bohemia, Czech Republic and invasive populations in Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore - Indiana. U.S.A.). Basic population characteristics (shoot density and average height of plants) and site characteristics (water level, irradiance) were quantified in native and invasive locations. Additionally, phytocoenological releves were taken to evaluate the frequency of co-occurring species in the primary and secondary regions. Lythrum salicaria occurs in a wide variety of habitat conditions in both native and invaded areas, from very dry locations along railroads to deep water in lakes or ponds. Statistically. invasive plants occurred more often in sites with deep water and very sparse vegetation.
   Invasive L. salicaria populations were more often monocultural (often connected with deep water), which is very rare in native populations. Native sites in the Czech Republic had higher species diversity than invasive sites in the U.S.

AB  - The saproxylic sap beetle Glischrochilus (Glischrochilus) quadripunctatus (Linnaeus, 1758), is associated with subcortical habitats of coniferous trees. This species is widely distributed across Europe and Siberia, and is the best known and largest European nitidulid species. A closely related cryptic species, G. (G.) tremulae sp. nov. has been discovered in a xerothermic area of SE Finland in association with old aspens. The two species exhibit a sympatric occurrence in SE Finland, on their respective host trees. We analyze the COI barcode region to compare G. (G.) quadripunctatus, G. (G.) tremulae sp. nov., and G. (Librodor) hortensis (Fourcroy, 1785). Morphological, ecological, and molecular data confirm the presence in SE Finland of two Glischrochilus s. str. species. We provide a description of the new species. The new Glischrochilus apparently represents a relictual taxon associated with old hollow aspens, and should be considered a species with inherent conservation value within European saproxylic beetle communities.

AB  - Large herbivores can change ecosystem functioning by impacting plant diversity. However, although such impacts are expected to be scale-dependent in ecosystems with wide-roaming ungulates, scaling issues rarely enter empirical assessments. We here test the hypothesis that the impact of increased reindeer abundance on plant diversity in alpine tundra is scale-dependent. Based on potentially high productivity of the focal habitat units and hence the possibility of positive grazer impacts on plant diversity we predicted higher alpha and beta diversity at the habitat scale where reindeer densities are high. We also explored whether there were differences in diversity patterns at larger scales, including the scale of reindeer management districts. We estimated grazing disturbance as high versus low reindeer density in selected districts (a total extent of 7421 km(2)) of Northern Norway where reindeer-induced vegetation shifts are debated. We focus on dominance patterns because they can quantify the vegetation state and thus performed additive partitioning of Simpson diversity on multiple scales assessing also species' contributions to diversity. Contrary to our predictions, we found only weak scale-dependent effects of reindeer grazing on plant diversity. Under high reindeer densities there was evidence for a landscape-scale homogenization of the vegetation, but the predicted alpha and beta diversity increases at the habitat scale were not found. Consistently through all scales considered, four shrub species contributed the most to plant diversity. These results contradict the idea that reindeer at high stocking densities induce shifts in plant species dominance in productive habitats. We conclude that context-dependencies such as spatial scales of management units and habitat types need to be explicitly considered in evaluations of the impacts of large ungulates on plant diversity.

AB  - A process-based model was used to assess the sensitivity of timber production and carbon (C) sequestration to the structure (in terms of age class distribution) of a boreal forest landscape and to the management under changing climatic conditions. Moreover, an approach to calculate the cost of C sequestration, through C sink enhancement, was used by computing the potential loss in the net present value (NPV) of timber when management with maximum C stock is chosen.
   Regardless of the climate scenario and initial age class distribution used, management had a clear effect on the mean C stock in the forest ecosystem. Any management regime allowing a higher tree stocking than business-as-usual management increased the timber production and simultaneously maintained or increased the C stock in the forest ecosystem. On the other hand, the maximum C stock in the forest and the lowest NPV were observed when no thinning was applied before the final cut. The changing climate increased forest productivity and also C stock. When using the same management for the entire management unit, the initial age class distribution had a large influence on the results of timber production (up to 20% difference) but not on C stock in the forest ecosystem (3%).

AB  - Mixed stands are currently supported as effective management options to reduce forest vulnerability to climate change. However, our issues about benefits of mixtures, mechanisms of their incidence and conditions for their effectiveness have yet been only partly clarified. We assessed the crown condition of Norway spruce (Picea abies /L./ Karst) and occurrence of symptoms caused by Armillaria spp. on spruce in a small area in the Drahanska vrchovina Highlands (Czech Republic) in differently mixed stands in 2002 and 2019. We found that although the broadleaf abundance affected the total defoliation of Norway spruce, the effect was unstable in time. The observed effect of altitudinal zones and Norway spruce abundance on the occurrence of symptoms of Armillaria root rot in spruce was also unstable. The drought during recent four years and the implemented forestry measures (salvage and intermediate felling) can be reasons for the relationship instability. We did not identify any statistically significant relationship between tree species diversity (Simpson's Index) and defoliation.

AB  - The new European Union Forest Strategy for 2030 aims to plant an additional 3 billion trees on non-forest land to mitigate climate change. However, the choice of tree species for afforestation to achieve the maximum climate benefit is unclear. We compared the climate benefit of six different species in terms of carbon (C) sequestration in biomass and the harvested wood substitution in products to avoid carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-based materials over the 100-year period by afforesting about 1/4 of the available area in northern Europe. The highest climate benefit was observed for larch, both at a stand scale (1626 Mg CO2 eqv. ha(-1)) and at the landscape level for the studied scenario (579 million Mg CO2 eqv.). Larch was followed by Norway spruce, poplar, hybrid aspen and birch, showing a climate benefit about 40-50% lower than that for larch. The climate benefit of willow was about 70% lower than larch. Willow showed 6-14-fold lower C stocks at the landscape level after 100 years than other tree species. The major climate benefit over the 100-year period comes from wood substitution and avoided emissions, but C stock buildup at the landscape level also removes significant amounts of CO2 already present in the atmosphere. The choice of tree species is important to maximize climate change mitigation.

AB  - Questions: What are the effects of abandonment on plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands? Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil?
   Location: West andmid-Norway.
   Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect.
   Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower.
   Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.

AB  - Disentangling the importance of developmental vs. environmental drivers of variation in forest biomass is key to predicting the future of forest carbon sequestration. At coarse scales, forest biomass is likely to vary along major climatic and physiographic gradients. Natural disturbance occurs along these broad biophysical gradients, and depending on their extent, severity and frequency, could either amplify or dampen spatial heterogeneity in forest biomass. Here we evaluate spatial variation in the basal area of late-successional Picea abies (L./Karst.) forests across the Carpathian Mountain Range of central Europe and compare the roles of coarse-scale biophysical gradients and natural disturbances in driving that variation across a hierarchy of scales (landscapes, stands, and plots). We inventoried forest composition and structure, and reconstructed disturbance histories using tree cores collected from 472 plots nested within 30 late-successional stands, spanning the Carpathian Mountains (approximately 4.5 degrees of latitude). We used linear mixed-effects models to compare the effect of disturbance regimes and site conditions on stand basal area at three hierarchical scales. We found that the basal area of late-successional Picea abies forests varied across a range of spatial scales, with climatic drivers being most important at coarse scales and natural disturbances acting as the primary driver of forest heterogeneity at fine scales. For instance, the stand-level basal area varied among landscapes, with the highest values (48-68 m(2) ha(-1)) in the warmer southern Carpathian Mountains, and lower values (37-52 m(2) ha(-1) on average) in cooler areas of the eastern and western Carpathians. Finer-scale variation was driven by local disturbances (mainly bark beetle and windstorms) and the legacies of disturbances that occurred more than a century ago. Our findings suggest that warming could increase the basal area of northern sites, but potential increasing disturbances could disrupt these environmental responses.

AB  - The bat fauna of 35 islands in a large lake in central Sweden were examined using ultrasound detectors. We tested the hypothesis that there is no difference in species number between the mainland and the island fauna. Eight species were found. Species numbers were analysed against island area, area of some habitats (coniferous forest, deciduous forest, semi-open habitats and open habitats), degree of isolation (distance from mainland and from 'stepping stones') and time spent searching for bats. Species number increased with area of deciduous forest. Presence of houses tended to increase species number. There seems to be a negative relationship between species number and degree of isolation (nearly significant). The results suggest that at least three species, Myotis brandti (Eversmann, 1845), M. mystacinus (Kuhl, 1819) and Plecotus auritus (Linnaeus, 1758), are negatively affected by forest patchiness. These species occurred mainly on large islands. Thus, the results do not support the hypothesis. The reasons why some species avoid open habitats are discussed.

AB  - Deepened knowledge on response of biota and ecological processes following fire is essential for a future with warmer climate and more disturbances. In 2014 the first mega-fire (13,100 ha) for at least a century in Scandinavia hit south-central Sweden, in a production forest landscape shaped by clearcutting forestry. Ecological dynamics is followed in >20 projects from universities, authorities and citizen science initiatives, rapidly accumulating substantial amounts of data. We outline projects and summarize their results during the first four years, demonstrating a rapid succession of fungi, lichens, vascular plants, birds, mammals, ticks, butterflies, beetles, and drastically altered carbon dynamics. We characterize forest operations including regeneration measures and point to patterns in pest and pathogen infestations. 8,000 ha is set aside for natural succession, with the rest harvested and managed for forest production, offering excellent opportunities for studies on salvage logging effects, already evident for birds. We demonstrate a strong regrowth of deciduous trees, and the protected part will in some decades likely develop into the largest deciduous-dominated area in boreal north Europe outside Russia. Continued studies of biodiversity and ecological processes are urgent for this unique area.

TI  - Effect of grassland cutting frequency on soil carbon storage - a case study on public lawns in three Swedish cities
T2  - SOIL
LA  - English
AB  - Soils contain the largest terrestrial carbon pool and thus play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Grassland soils have particularly high soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. In Europe (EU 25), grasslands cover 22% of the land area. It is therefore important to understand the effects of grassland management and management intensity on SOC storage. City lawns constitute a unique study system in this context, since they provide a high functional diversity and thus a wide range of different management intensities per unit area. In this study we investigated frequently mown (on average eight times per season) utility lawns and rarely mown (once per season) meadow-like lawns at three multi-family housing areas in each of three Swedish cities: Uppsala, Malmo, and Gothenburg. The two different lawn types were compared regarding their aboveground net primary production (NPP) and SOC storage. In addition, root biomass was determined in Uppsala. We found significantly higher aboveground NPP and SOC concentrations and significantly lower soil C : N ratio for the utility lawns compared with the meadow-like lawns. On average, aboveground NPP was 24% or 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) higher and SOC was 12% or 7.8 Mg ha(-1) higher. Differences in SOC were well explained by differences in aboveground NPP (R-2 = 0.39), which indicates that the increase in productivity due to more optimum CO2-assimilating leaf area, leading to higher carbon input to the soil, was the major driver for soil carbon sequestration. Differences in soil C : N ratio indicated a more closed N cycle in utility lawns, which might have additionally affected SOC dynamics. We did not find any difference in root biomass between the two management regimes, and concluded that cutting frequency most likely only exerts an effect on SOC when cuttings are left on the surface.

AB  - The co-cultivation of finfish and bivalve filter feeders, with the purpose of recycling solid waste effluents and enhancing aquaculture revenues, has stimulated efforts to characterize particulate waste dynamics at open-water fish farms. Temporal variability in waste concentrations in the water column was studied at Atlantic salmon Salmo salar farms in eastern Canada and Norway, and at a sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria farm in western Canada. Turbidity and chlorophyll a (chl a) sensors were used to continuously monitor suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chl a concentrations at various depths and distances to the net-pens. Time-series analysis of these data indicated that SPM fluctuations at the study sites corresponded largely with tidal periodicity and variations in phytoplankton biomass (chl a). ANOVA comparisons of mean SPM levels in water flowing from the direction of net-pens (potential farm influence) and towards the farm (control) generally indicated insignificant effects of fish wastes on SPM levels at the farms (p > 0.05). A significant effect of the farm was detected by an ANOVA comparison of SPM concentrations collected at 5 m depth at farm and reference stations in an oligotrophic fjord, but the calculated level of waste enhancement over the sampling period was extremely small (0.02 mg l(-1)). Results indicate that temporal variations in SPM concentrations around the open-water fish farms were largely driven by natural processes and that the addition of fish wastes had a negligible effect. Consequently, there is little rationale for introducing commercial extractive species (e.g. bivalves) in open-water integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems to mitigate the horizontal flux of particulate fish wastes.

AB  - The vegetation history has been examined by pollen, microscopic and macroscopic charcoal analyses in the vicinity of two alpine Stallo settlement sites and one forested 'Reference area' with no settlement remains in northwestern Sweden in the northern part of the Scandinavian mountain range. The acquired data provide indications of the effects of human activities on local vegetation during the settlement phase, and on ecological processes in both long-and short-term perspectives. The results show that one settlement site, Gieddealge, was established just above the forest line in the Betula treeline zone, and the other, Varenodjukke, in the Betula forest. At Gieddealge an increase in herbs and graminoids appears to have occurred c. 700 cal. BP (during the thirteenth century) suggesting that the vegetation was altered by nutrient addition, most likely related to human activities associated with the settlement. At Varenodjukke, the Betula trees around the settlement were cut down and the site developed into an alpine heath dominated by Betula nana, which still characterizes the site today. In the Reference area evidence of changes to the vegetation probably caused by human impact was also found from c. 3500 to 700 cal. BP. In conclusion, the vegetation currently present at Gieddealge and Varenodjukke has been strongly influenced by previous human activities, which have clearly had profound effects, both short and long term, on the composition of the vegetation and the properties of the ecosystems in these areas. Further, when studying processes, such as anticipated global warming that will influence future patterns of vegetation in these forest-line areas, legacies of land use must be taken into consideration.

AB  - Gentle Remediation Options (GRO) are remediation measures involving plants, fungi, bacteria, and soil amendments that can be applied to manage risks at contaminated sites. Several studies and decision-support tools promote the wider range of benefits provided by GRO, but there is still skepticism regarding GRO implementation. Key issues that need to be better communicated are the various risk mitigation mechanisms, the required risk reduction for an envisioned land use, and the time perspective associated with the risk mitigation mechanisms. To increase the viability and acceptance of GRO, the phytomanagement approach implies the combination of GRO with beneficial green land use, gradually reducing risks and restoring ecosystem services. To strengthen the decision basis for GRO implementation in practice, this paper proposes a framework for risk management and communication of GRO applications to support phytomanagement strategies at contaminated sites. The mapping of the risk mitigation mechanisms is done by an extensive literature review and the Swedish national soil guideline value model is used to derive the most relevant human health exposure pathways and ecological risks for generic green land use scenarios. Results indicate that most of the expected risk mitigation mechanisms are supported by literature, but that knowledge gaps still exist. The framework is demonstrated to support the identification of GRO options for the case study site given two envisioned land uses: biofuel park and allotment garden. A more easily understandable risk management framework, as proposed here, is expected to act as a communication tool to educate decision-makers, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders for better understanding of risk mitigation mechanisms and preliminary timeframes of various GRO, particularly in the early stages of a brownfield redevelopment project.

AB  - Understanding how spatial patterning relates to ecological processes is fundamental to define important species-environment associations at broader scales. Analyses targeting habitat structure (i.e. composition and configuration) in terrestrial landscapes are increasing, but similar studies in marine landscapes are still relatively uncommon. In this study, we explored how seascape structure and complexity (determined from significant spatial pattern metrics) influenced summer and autumn fish assemblage composition in 30 seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows along the west coast of Sweden. Species density was not influenced by seascape structure in any season. In contrast, the majority of significant fish assemblage variables were influenced by seascape structure during the summer (i.e. abundance and proportion of juveniles, abundance of Labridae and abundance of occasional shallow-water visitors) whilst fewer in the autumn (i.e. abundance of occasional shallow-water visitors and Synganthidae). For instance, less complex seascapes were more suitable for juvenile assemblages in summer, as these seascapes exhibit larger patch sizes of appropriate habitat (e.g. Z. marina) and less edge boundaries providing refuges from predators and food resources. Abundances of migrating fish, such as the sea trout Salmo trutta, also responded positively to a less complex seascape in the summer though perhaps ecological processes, such as prey availability, were additional contributing factors driving this relationship. High complexity seascapes only had a positive influence on the abundance of taxa using multiple habitats (Labridae during the summer). Our study shows that fish assemblages in temperate marine environments are significantly linked to spatial habitat patterning and seascape complexity. This offers valuable insights into species-habitat-seascape linkages, information important for coastal conservation and marine spatial planning.

AB  - A vegetation survey of semi-permanent plots was performed in 1977-1980 and in 1997-1998 to study the floristic changes in a mixed deciduous forest situated in a region of intensive livestock, breeding. Our aim was to test the hypothesis of allogenic succession in the forest ground vegetation caused by the emissions of the surrounding agricultural activities. During the last 20 years, a significant increase of nitrogen indicators and a decline of moisture indicators were observed. Results were consistent at the community, the plot and the species level. Nitrogen deposition and the lowering of the groundwater table are suggested as the driving forces behind the changes. The results are discussed in the context of current ecological theory concerning resource competition and community diversity.

AB  - The resolution of the Kyoto Protocol to include effects of land use and land-use change in global carbon budgets has put focus on C sequestration following afforestation of former arable land. Carbon is sequestered in the aggrading biomass of the new forests, but the question remains, to what extent the former arable soils will contribute as sinks for CO2. The present study explored changes in soil C stores following afforestation of former arable land with oak (Quercus robur L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Seven stands of each tree species on nutrient-rich soils made up a chronosequence ranging from 1 to 29 years. An adjacent similar to200-year-old mixed deciduous plantation was included to give information on the possible long term changes in soil C. Soil sampling included organic layers and three layers of the mineral soil to a depth of 25 cm.
   Development of forest floors sequestered most C in spruce stands. While oak stands sequestered around 2 Mg C ha(-1), spruce stands sequestered approximately 9 Mg C ha(-1) in forest floors over 29 years. There were no differences between the two tree species in C concentration and storage of the three mineral soil layers. Carbon concentration and storage increased in the upper 5 cm of the mineral soil but decreased in the 5-15 and 15-25 cm soil layers with increasing stand age. The soil C store appeared to be undergoing redistribution following afforestation, and mineral soil C stores in 0-25 cm tended to decrease over the 29-year period. Together with the C sequestration of forest floors, this led to fairly similar total soil C stores of around 65 Mg ha(-1) along the 29-year chronosequence. Within this short time span, C sequestration mainly occurred in the biomass of trees while soil C stores were clearly higher in the similar to200-year-old plantation (81 Mg C ha(-1)). The ongoing redistribution of mineral soil C in the young stands and the higher soil C contents in the similar to200-year-old afforested stand suggest that nutrient-rich afforestation soils may become greater sinks for C in long term.

AB  - Over the past two years, the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and the UK have increased climate ambition and aggressively pushed forward an agenda to pursue climate neutrality or net-zero emissions by mid-century. This increased ambition, partly the result of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's landmark findings on limiting global warming to 1.5 & DEG;C, has also led to a renewed approach to and revitalized debate about the role of carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal. With increasing climate ambition, including a mid-century climate neutrality goal for the whole European Union, the potential role of technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is emerging as one of the critical points of debate among NGOs, policymakers, and the private sector. Policymakers are starting to discuss how to incentivize a CDR scale-up. What encompasses the current debate, and how does it relate to CDR technologies' expected role in reaching climate neutrality? This perspective will highlight that policy must fill two gaps: the accounting and the commercialization gap for the near-term development of a comprehensive CDR policy framework. It will shine a light on the current status of negative emission technologies and the role of carbon capture and storage in delivering negative emissions in Europe's decarbonized future. It will also analyze the role of carbon markets, including voluntary markets, as potential incentives while exploring policy pathways for a near-term scale-up.

AB  - Mountain treelines can be seen as boundaries between two vegetation zones - the alpine and subalpine zones - and function as an indicator of ecosystem change. Interpreting factors leading to changes in mountains includes disturbance from human resource use and climate as important factors. The article shows that forest line changes in eastern Jotunheimen, a mountain region in southern Norway, can be related to changes in livestock grazing pressure between the 1960s and 2002. In contrast to other European mountain regions, highly relevant climate variables such as the triterm (the summer months) have not changed in the studied region. Therefore, land-use change is considered the main driver for the forest line shifts observed in the region. However, the predicted climate warming, together with continued trends of decreasing and abandoned free-range grazing of livestock will cause further forest expansion above the present forest lines also in the eastern Jotunheimen mountain range.

AB  - Forest conservation strategies and plans can be unsuccessful if the new habitat conditions determined by climate change are not considered. Our work aims at investigating the likelihood of future suitability, distribution and diversity for some common European forest species under the projected changes in climate, focusing on Southern Europe. We combine an Ensemble Platform for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) driven by two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), to produce maps of future climate-driven habitat suitability for ten categories of forest species and two time horizons. For each forest category and time horizon, ten maps of future distribution (5 GCMs by 2 RCPs) are thus combined in a single suitability map supplied with information about the likelihood adopting the IPCC terminology based on consensus among projections. Then, the statistical significance of spatially aggregated changes in forest composition at local and regional level is analyzed. Finally, we discuss the importance, among SDMs, that environmental predictors seem to have in influencing forest distribution. Future impacts of climate change appear to be diversified across forest categories. A strong change in forest regional distribution and local diversity is projected to take place, as some forest categories will find more suitable conditions in previously unsuitable locations, while for other categories the same new conditions will become less suited. A decrease in species diversity is projected in most of the area, with Alpine region showing the potentiality to become a refuge for species migration.

AB  - We summed estimates of the carbon balance of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance during the 1990s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all European countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequestering carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon balance.
   Net terrestrial carbon balances were typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emissions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, however, of utmost importance to acknowledge that the typically small net carbon balance represents the small difference between two large but opposing fluxes: uptake by forests and grasslands and losses from arable lands and peatlands. This suggests that relatively small changes in either or both of these large component fluxes could induce large effects on the net total, indicating that mitigation schemes should not be discarded a priori.
   In the absence of carbon-oriented land management, the current net carbon uptake is bound to decline soon. Protecting it will require actions at three levels; a) maintaining the current sink activity of forests, b) altered agricultural management practices to reduce the emissions from arable soils or turn into carbon sinks and c) protecting current large reservoirs (wetlands and old forests), since carbon is lost more rapidly than sequestered.

AB  - Variation in the waterfowl community structures of wetland habitat types were studied in the northern part of the Finnish lake district during two decades (1970-1990). Mixotrophic and eutrophic lake types were identified on the basis of DCA ordinations of waterfowl assemblages. The community gradients of these lake types were distinguished also on an annual scale. The communities were found to be fairly stable across time. Total waterfowl densities fluctuated most (CV% 13-14), and the number of species (CV% 5-7) and species diversity (CV% 1-3) the least. The between-year component for total diversities was only 1-2% and the number of species 12-13%. The two lake types showed different dynamics of species populations. CV% of pair numbers of the three most abundant species were 12-29% in mixotrophic lakes and 30-36% in eutrophic ones. Gradients of community structure and long-term dynamics seem to be primarily connected with habitat, indicating that the lakes are in different phases of ecological succession.

AB  - The ability of natural resource agencies to act before, during, and after outbreaks of conifer bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is important to ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services. Adaptive capacity refers to the capability of an agent or system to adapt to change, regardless of whether it is examined as an independent social or ecological entity, or as a coupled social-ecological system. Understanding the components of a disturbance and the associated effects to ecosystem services, social systems, and natural resource management increases the ability to adapt to change and ensure continued resilience. This paper presents a definition and conceptual framework of adaptive capacity relevant to bark beetle disturbances that was developed through an interdisciplinary workshop held in 2016. The intent is to assist natural resource managers and policy-makers in identifying important adaptation characteristics to effectively address bark beetle disturbances. The current state of knowledge regarding institutional, social, and environmental factors that influence adaptive capacity are identified. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the western USA is used as a specific example to discuss several factors that influence adaptive capacity for increasing resilience. We hope that that our proposed framework serves as a model for future collaborations among both social and physical scientists and land managers to better address landscape-level disturbances that are being exacerbated by climate change.

AB  - The process-based forest growth model 4C (FORESEE - FORESt Ecosystems in a Changing Environment) was used to analyze the growth of a mixed oak-pine stand [Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl., Pinta sylvestris L.]. The oak-pine stand is typical for the ongoing forest transformation in the north-eastern lowlands. The pine and the oak trees are 104 and 9 years old, respectively. Three different management scenarios (A, B, C) with different thinning grades and a thinning interval of five years were simulated. Every management scenario was simulated under three different climate scenarios (OK, 2K, 3K) compiled by the regional statistical climate model STAR 2.0 (PIK). For each climate scenario 100 different realisations were generated. The realisations of the climate scenarios encompass the period 2036-2060 and exhibit an increase of mean annual temperature of zero, two and three Kelvin until 2060, respectively. We selected 9 model outputs concerning biomass, growth and harvest which were aggregated to a single total performance index (TPI). The TPI was used to assess the management scenarios with regard to three management objectives (carbon sequestration, intermediate, timber yield) under climate change until 2060.
   We found out that management scenario A led to the highest TPI concerning the carbon sequestration objective and management scenario C performed best concerning the two other objectives. The analysis of variance in the growth related model outputs showed an increase of climate uncertainty with increasing climate warming. Interestingly, the increase of climate induced uncertainty is much higher from 2 to 3 K than from 0 to 2 K.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) play an important role in sustainable landscape management. People value ESs in diverse ways encompassing social and ecological domains and we need to bring these different values together. We used social-cultural and biophysical methods to map a diverse set of ESs at two spatial scales in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Norway. The ESs bundled into three distinct social-ecological system archetypes which were similar in their distribution and relative ES values at both spatial scales. The bundles were also well matched to relative ESs values of the Biosphere Reserve zones (core, buffer, and transition) indicating that the bundles capture the social-ecological systems of the zones. We argue that it is important to consider the social-ecological context of the zones to provide sufficient knowledge to inform management. Our work has the capacity to contribute to sustainable land management that takes biocultural values into consideration.

AB  - This paper presents a new forest harvest scheduling model taking into account four conflicting objectives. The economic factor of timber production is considered and also aspects related to environmental protection. We also incorporate adjacency constraints to limit the maximum contiguous area where clear-cutting can be applied. The model proposed is applied to a timber production plantation in Cuba located in the region of Pinar del Rio. One factor to be taken into account in Cuban plantations is that the forest has a highly unbalanced age distribution. Therefore, in addition to the classical objectives of forest planning, we have the objective of rebalancing age distribution by the end of the planning horizon. Explicitly, the four objectives considered in the model are: (a) obtaining a balance-aged forest; (b) minimizing the area with trees older than the rotation age; (c) maximizing the NPV of the forest over the planning horizon; and (d) maximizing total carbon sequestration over the whole planning horizon. The solution to the proposed model provides a set of efficient management plans that are of assistance in analysing the tradeoffs between the economic and ecological objectives. The model is also applied to randomly generated simulated forests to compare its performance in other contexts. As the problem is a multiobjective binary nonlinear model, a metaheuristic procedure is used in order to solve it.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) for industrial emission point sources is one of the potential instruments to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) goals. However, emission point sources and storage formations are often far from each other, which requires capable CO2 transportation infrastructure. While pipeline transportation promises low cost for high and stable flows of CO2, ship transportation may be more expensive but also more flexible with regards to transport quantities and storage locations. Here, we present a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to provide decision support for a CCS Supply Chain Design Problem (CCS-SCDP) with the goal of minimizing total supply chain costs. We apply the model to four future CO2 supply scenarios, capturing CO2 from German industrial sources and bringing them to the Northern Lights unloading port in Kollsnes, Norway, for storage in a submarine geological formation. Our analysis reveals that the fraction of transportation costs of total supply chain costs drop considerably from 22 to 10 percent by economies of scale if annual capture volume increases. For low capture volumes, a ship-based solution is cheaper, while an offshore pipeline solution is favored for larger capture volumes. Accordingly, the potential gains from economies of scale in a pipeline-based solution must be balanced against potential lock-in effects in the investment decision for a CCS supply chain.

AB  - Forest management faces growing uncertainty concerning environmental conditions and demand for ecosystem services. To help forest managers consider uncertainty, we applied a robust and multi-criteria approach to select the optimal composition of a forest enterprise from 12 stand types. In our simulation, the forest enterprise strives for either financial return or a multi-criteria forest management considering financial return, carbon storage and forest ecosystem stability. To quantify the influence of climate change on these decision criteria, we used the concept of analogous climate zones. Our results provide recommendations for long-term strategies for tree species selection in a Southeast German forest enterprise. The results show that considering both uncertainty and multifunctionality in forest management led to more diversified forest compositions. However, robust and multi-criteria optimisation required the forest enterprise to pay a premium in terms of lower income. Financial returns decreased when forest composition accounted for uncertainty or multiple objectives. We also found that adaptation measures could only partly financially compensate the effects of climate change. As the study is limited to two tree species, including additional tree species, variants of mixing proportions and further silvicultural strategies in the optimisation appears a promising avenue for future research.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the importance of floodplains in preserving biodiversity, and call attention to alternative ways of managing floodplains in relation to probable scenarios of climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 20 water bodies on the floodplain at Flisa along the River Glomma (Hedmark County, Eastern Norway) were investigated with regards to crustacean zooplankton and water beetle species richness.
   Findings - Both on a national and regional scale, the species diversity in the investigated water bodies was high. A total of 57 crustacean plankton and 77 water beetle species were recorded. Of these, ten and eight were new records of zooplankton and water beetle species in Hedmark County, respectively. Seven recorded water beetle species were specified in the 2010 Norwegian Red List of Species. Further, the localities on the Flisa floodplain are relatively unique with regard to the composition of species compared to other investigated localities in Hedmark County.
   Social implications - Floodplains are intensively used and are considered as among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. More frequent and less predictable floods can be expected in the future due to climate change's influence. In some settings more frequent larger floods may work to re-establish the connectivity, but larger floods might also result in demand for construction of more extensive flood mitigation measures.
   Originality/value - The results from this case study underpin the high biodiversity of floodplains, an ecosystem infrequently examined in Norway. The results of this study are of importance regarding management and maintenance of ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity and water retention) from floodplains.

AB  - Three new Ophryotrocha species are described from sites with high levels of organic carbon flux including a whale-fall at 125 m depth off the Swedish coast and sediment sampled at 104 m depth beneath a fish farm in a Norwegian fjord. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nuclear gene H3 and the mitochondrial genes COI and 16S using MrBayes and Maximum Likelihood analyses show that Ophryotrocha eutrophila sp. nov. is a close relative to Ophryotrocha puerilis, while Ophryotrocha craigsmithi sp. nov. falls together with Palpiphitime lobifera, and Ophryotrocha scutellus sp. nov. occur within the 'hartmanni' clade. The genus Ophryotrocha is in our study monophyletic only if the genera Iphitime and Palpiphitime are included. Two representatives of Ophryotrocha previously described from anthropogenically-enriched sediments are here reported for the first time in very high abundance from a naturally occurring habitat. We suggest that whale falls are important habitats for the evolution of ecosystem services such as the degradation of complex organic compounds.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation should be considered in forest management. Most forests have a long history of moderate human disturbances. In the temperate region this coevolution. has resulted in high species diversity since many threatened herbaceous species depend on moderate forest disturbances. This study considered these species in Estonia. One-third of Estonian threatened herbaceous species were estimated to be dependent on moderate forest disturbances. All of these species are favoured by small-scale gaps through partial cutting or allowing natural uprooting of trees to occur. Several species are favoured by moderate soil disturbances (paths, horseriding, etc.) and clearing of undergrowth. A smaller number of species are favoured by grazing or by prescribed fires. Disturbance-dependent species ranked high in the national Red Data Book and they were particularly characteristic in dry forests. Disturbance-dependent herbaceous species should be considered as a target group for ecosystem-based forest management. Moderate disturbances are required in both managed and protected forests to conserve forest biodiversity.

AB  - Forest age is one of the most simple but ecologically effective key values that may be controlled by forest management. Young and mature but managed forests differ significantly from old-growth forests in species composition, structure and socio-ecological function. Human land-use has already caused the loss or dramatic reduction in occurrence of some entire species assemblages, especially of logging-sensitive species, in Central European forests. These general statements also apply to beech forests, beech (Fagus sylvatica) being the naturally dominating tree species in Central Europe. Based on data for breeding birds (from 258 sampling plots in a sub-montane and 228 plots in a montane area), molluscs (36 plots in the sub-montane and 79 plots in the montane area) and lichens (84 plots in the montane forest), this paper aims at identifying significant forest age threshold ranges for the occurrence of these old-growth sensitive taxa. The sampling plots in the sub-montane zone (420-520 m a.s.l.) are in beech-oak forests, plots in the montane zone (650-1150 m a.s.l.) are in beech-spruce-fir forests. Stand ages in both areas range up to around 350-400 years. Threshold values for the total number of species related to stand age were calculated by recursive partitioning.
   In all three taxonomic groups the number of species per plot significantly increases with forest age. The same analysis was run for red-listed lichen and mollusc species as well as hole-nesting bird species. The threshold values obtained are very similar to those for the whole species assemblages, except for molluscs where considerably lower threshold values are computed with red-listed species assemblages. Regarding the confidence intervals, the difference pattern between the whole species datasets and the more sensitive species subsets is inconsistent. Threshold values in sub-montane beech forests range from 100 to 170 years and in mixed montane forests from 160 to 220 years.
   These threshold levels are clearly incompatible with economic interests that aim on reducing the rotation period in beech stands to less than 140 years to avoid formation of red heartwood. It would therefore seem to be essential to establish a network of trees and stands that are never logged and may thus act as areas for retreat and dispersion for logging-sensitive species.

AB  - Planting non-native tree species, like Douglas fir in temperate European forest systems, is encouraged to mitigate effects of climate change. However, Douglas fir monocultures often revealed negative effects on forest biota, while effects of mixtures with native tree species on forest ecosystems are less well understood. We investigated effects of three tree species (Douglas fir, Norway spruce, native European beech), on ground beetles in temperate forests of Germany. Beetles were sampled in monocultures of each tree species and broadleaf-conifer mixtures with pitfall traps, and environmental variables were assessed around each trap. We used linear mixed models in a two-step procedure to disentangle effects of environment and tree species identity on ground beetle abundance, species richness, functional diversity and species assemblage structure. Contradictory to our expectations, ground beetle abundance and functional diversity was highest in pure Douglas fir stands, while tree mixtures showed intermediate values between pure coniferous and pure beech stands. The main drivers of these patterns were only partially dependent on tree species identity, which highlights the importance of structural features in forest stands. However, our study revealed distinct shifts in assemblage structure between pure beech and pure Douglas fir stands, which were only partially eased through mixture planting. Our findings suggest that effects of planting non-native trees on associated biodiversity can be actively modified by promoting beneficial forest structures. Nevertheless, integrating non-native tree species, even in mixtures with native trees, will invariably alter assemblage structures of associated biota, which can compromise conservation efforts targeted at typical species composition.

AB  - Following the growth of nature-based tourism, "pristine" and remote areas, such as national parks, attract tourists in Scandinavia. Various international initiatives and certification programs, such as PAN Parks in Europe, have been introduced to promote sustainable nature-based tourism. Often tourists are also given responsibility to prevent negative environmental impacts of their travel. This paper examines the role of nature tourists in developing sustainable tourism: what expectations do tourists have on nature and sustainability in national parks, how do they consider environmental aspects when travelling, and how do they respond to ecolabels and certifications? Thirty interviews of mainly Finnish tourists were conducted in Oulanka National Park, one of PAN Parks certified parks in Finland. The results show that these nature tourists do not form a homogenous group, yet they have various views on environmental issues, which differentiate them from other nature tourists and have an influence on their travelling behavior. Thus, four types of tourists were identified on the basis of their environmental concern and responsibility. The results emphasize the role of regulation, incentives and guidance in developing sustainability in tourist destinations and companies; tourists do not necessarily set high demands as long as negative impacts do not ruin their perception of pristine nature.

AB  - The influence of prescribed burning on ground beetles was studied in a single 12-ha stand that was partially clear-cut, selectively-cut and retained (= standing forest), and was compared to an unburned stand in 2002 in SE Norway. Thirty-two species were collected using Barber pitfall traps. Carabids were more numerous and more diverse in the burned area, compared to the unburned forest. Overall abundance was highest in the selectively-cut treatment, followed by the clear-cut and standing forest. Species diversity tended to increase in the sequence unburned forest - burned standing forest - burned selectively-cut - burned clearcut. Species composition differed little between the burned treatments. Pterostichus adstrictus, a species associated with open habitats and which frequently colonizes burned areas, was the most abundant species collected. It was most common in the burned area, particularly in the selectively-cut treatment. Our results suggest that burning of a single stand may support some carabid species, even endangered ones, although larger forest fires are probably more effective for conservation purposes.

AB  - Land use affects the carbon sequestration potential of soils across landscapes. Tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems where annual crops are grown between established tree rows are expected to exhibit spatial heterogeneity in the soil organic carbon (SOC) content due to differences in carbon input and decomposition rates of litter from trees and herbaceous plants. This study aimed to quantify variability in the SOC of TBI systems, compare the SOC content of TBI and nearby conventional agroecosystems, and determine if SOC was related to soil fertility. The TBI research sites were established 4 years (St. Paulin and St. Edouard, Quebec, Canada), 8 years (St. Remi, Quebec, Canada) and 21 years (Guelph, Ontario, Canada) before soil samples were collected for this study. The SOC content was greater within 0.75 m of the tree row than in the intercropped space at the St. Edouard and St. Remi sites. At the Guelph site, the SOC was spatially heterogeneous in plots with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) but not hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x P. nigra clone DN-177), probably due to litterfall distribution. Formerly a tree plantation, the TBI system at St. Remi contained 77% more SOC than a nearby conventional agroecosystem, while there was 12% more SOC in the TBI system than the conventional agroecosystem at Guelph. There was no difference in the SOC content of 4-year old TBI sites and nearby conventional agroecosystems. However, an increase in SOC at all TBI sites was positively related to the plant-available N concentrations, indicating the benefit of temperate TBI systems for soil fertility.

AB  - The importance of different fractions of coarse wood debris (cwd) for species diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi was investigated in near-natural Danish beech stands. Species number per tree increased significantly with increasing tree size, pointing out large trees to be most valuable for fungal diversity if single samples are compared. Rarefaction curves, evaluating the importance of different cwd fractions in a cumulative space, revealed a different and more complex picture. Rarefaction curves based on wood volume showed small trees and branches to host more species per volume unit than larger trees and logs, respectively, while snags were the most species-poor fraction. Surface-based curves showed species density to be rather similar among cwd types, though species density still decreased slightly with tree size. These results are interpreted to reflect a combination of two factors: firstly, small diameter cwd represent a larger surface area per volume and hence more space for fungal sporocarps, than large diameter cwd. This 'surface area factor' explains the high degree of similarity of the surface-based rarefaction curves. Secondly, a collection of small diameter cwd involves more separate units than an equal volume of large diameter cwd, and represents thereby more individual cases of fungal infection and, most likely, more variation in environmental conditions. The effect of this 'number of item factor' is reflected in the slightly increasing species density per surface area with decreasing tree size. Richness patterns of red-listed and non-red-listed species were found to be strikingly similar across cwd types, and a general preference for large logs among red-listed species was hence absent. An individual look at the most frequent encountered red-listed species revealed substrate preference patterns to occur in three of six species, of which one, the heart-rot agent Ischnoderma resinosum, preferred large logs. Based on these results, it would be obvious to conclude that local fungal species diversity is most efficiently increased in managed forests if small diameter cwd is prioritised for natural decay. However, small diameter wood appear to be unable to support heart-rot agents and other species depending on a long and diverse infection history and thus the integrity of saproxylic communities may be seriously undermined if only small diameter cwd is left for decay. Therefore, we strongly recommend that whole, naturally dead trees, representing the full range of cwd habitats, are prioritised for natural decay in managed forests whenever possible.

AB  - Developing adaptive forest management strategies is essential to maintain the provisioning of forest goods and services (FGS) under future climate change. We assessed how climate change and forest management affect forest development and FGS for a diverse case-study landscape in Central Europe. Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region.
   We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion. Lastly, the large impact of past management practices on the spatial heterogeneity of forest dynamics underpins the need to assess FGS provisioning at the landscape scale.

AB  - Improving our understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services is crucial for the development of sustainable agriculture. We introduce a novel framework that is based on the identification of indicator species for single or multiple ecosystem services across taxonomic groups based on indicator species analyses. We utilize multi-species community data (unlike previous single species approaches) without giving up information about the identity of species in our framework (unlike previous species richness approaches). We compiled a comprehensive community dataset including abundances of 683 invertebrate, vertebrate and plant species to identify indicator species that were either positively or negatively related to biological control, diversity of red-listed species or crop yield in agricultural landscapes in southern Sweden. Our results demonstrate that some taxonomic groups include significantly higher percentages of indicator species for these ecosystem services. Spider communities for example included a higher percentage of significant positive indicator species for biological control than ground or rove beetle communities. Bundles of indicator species for the analysed ecosystem service potentials usually included species that could be linked to the respective ecosystem service based on their functional role in local communities. Several of these species are conspicuous enough to be monitored by trained amateurs and could be used in bundles that are either crucial for the provision of individual ecosystem services or indicate agricultural landscapes with high value for red-listed species or crop yields. The use of bundles of characteristic indicator species for the simultaneous assessment of ecosystem services may reduce the amount of labour, time and cost in future assessments. In addition, future analysis using our framework in other ecosystems or with other subsets of ecosystem services and taxonomic groups will improve our understanding of service-providing species in local communities. In any case, expert knowledge is needed to select species from the identified subsets of significant indicator species and these species should be validated by existing data or additional sampling prior to being used for ecosystem service monitoring.

AB  - Recirculation of plant nutrients from waste materials back to agriculture is necessary in a sustainable food production system. In this study we investigated the long-term effect of direct land application of sewage sludge (SS) on soil fertility on two Swedish farms, where field experiments were set up in 1981 with three rates of SS (0, 4 and 12Mgdrymatterha(-1) every 4years) and three rates of mineral fertilisation, in a factorial design with four replicates. At one site, SS application tended to increase crop yield over time but, when plant nutrients were not limiting, the effect was only significant for spring barley. We deduced that improved soil structure was the main driver for this fertility enhancement after SS application, as indicated by lower soil bulk density and higher soil carbon concentration. After 30years, soil organic carbon stocks to 0.40m depth differed by up to 17Mgha(-1) between treatments. According to carbon balance calculations, retention of carbon derived from SS ranged between 18 and 20% for the soil layers analysed at the two sites. Soluble phosphorus (P) increased with sludge application rate, but represented only around 2% of the expected residual P according to P-balance calculations. The fertiliser value of nitrogen was also low, with only 3-8% nitrogen use efficiency. Heavy metals such as copper, zinc and mercury showed moderate accumulation in the soil, but elevated levels of metals were not detected in crops, even at the highest dose of SS. These results show that SS represents a valuable resource for improving soil fertility in terms of soil organic matter and soil structure, but its efficiency for nutrient cycling is very low within the time frame considered in the study.

AB  - An adequate understanding of an old-growth forest structure and its variability is needed for forest conservation and restoration. We studied the local scale structural variability of boreal old-growth forests on a Hylocomium-Myrtillus site type in the Pallas-Yllastunturi National Park in northern Finland. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the main directions of structural and compositional variability were related to variables describing the total volume of coarse woody debris (CWD), volumes of living and dead Pinus sylvestris and volume of deciduous CWD. An average, living tree volume was 141.5 m(3) ha(-1), varying among the 252 sample plots from 15.3 to 442.0 m(3) ha(-1). The mean CWD volume was 30.0 m(3) ha(-1) (0-99.3 m(3) ha(-1)). Downed and standing CWD comprised on average 64.6% and 35.4% of the total CWD volume, respectively. In general, the diameter distributions of living, standing and downed dead trees followed a negative exponential shape. Our results demonstrate high variability in structure and composition of old-growth forests on a northern boreal mesic Hylocomium-Myrtillus site type. This natural variability should be taken into account in forest restoration and management at landscape level.

AB  - Vegetation records from 1963-66 and 1990 were compared in eight semi-permanent plots from continuously managed, semi-natural hay-meadows from five sites in southern Sweden to find out whether changes in plant communities could be detected in these grasslands over a period of ca. 25 years in spite of unchanged management. It was found that species richness, ct-diversity and species frequency distribution remained fairly constant over the period, while there was considerable species turnover. However, it was also found that the total cover of vascular plants increased as well as the proportion of graminoids, both in cover and in species number, with a corresponding decrease of forbs. The number of species favoured by mowing also decreased as well as the number of typical grassland species. The detected changes are interpreted partly as effects of increased loads of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and partly related to small changes in management intensity (changed frequency of mowing and/or aftermath grazing). It is possible that the significant land use changes in adjacent areas resulting in large landscape changes (increase of forests and woodlands) might have negatively influenced the interchange of grassland species, leading to an increase in the number of non-typical grassland species in the meadows.

AB  - This paper describes a multi-proxy palaeoecological investigation undertaken in conjunction with an archaeological survey of the Upper Sangro Valley in the Abruzzo National Park, Central Italy. Despite being a biodiversity hotspot and regarded as a near-pristine area, the pollen, spore and diatom data all show major changes in the vegetation extending to over 2000m a.s.l. during the mid to late Holocene. Although there are changes in ecological composition earlier in the Holocene they are different in type and magnitude from the changes which began about 800cal a BC. The pollen and diatom evidence do not correlate well with regional palaeoclimate data, or on-site isotopic evidence, but do appear to be related to Samnite (later Iron Age) clearance and upland grazing associated with transhumance and later annexation (and centuriation) of the lower slopes by Roman surveyors. The greatest change in vegetation was during the period c. AD 500600 and corresponds with the ByzantineGothic Wars, and LombardCarolingian settlement reorganization into nucleated hilltop settlements which managed upland grazing. This pattern of intensive land use at all altitudes persisted until the early 20th century and only changed following rural depopulation after World War II. These data illustrate how cultural factors had a profound effect on this mountainous region which, in this case, far outweighed the effects of climatic fluctuations which are known to have occurred from both this study area and the region.

AB  - Bryophytes of all mire types present in an area of southern Sweden were sampled in 600 snail plots, each including at least one hepatic species. Ecological preferences for the hepatics were estimated using ordination, tests of log-likelihood ratio for contingency tables, and calculations of niche breadths. Preferences for the 20 most frequent hepatic species are presented. It is concluded that the hepatic species exhibit a similar ecological diversity to other taxonomic groups of bryophytes. Aneura pinguis, Cladopadiella fluitans, Gymnocolea inflata and Mylia anomala have a narrow ecological amplitude in the mire habitat, whereas some small species, e.g. Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cephalozia spp., Cephaloziella elachista and Kurzia pauciflora, have wider ecological amplitudes. The term 'compromise strategy' is introduced for the hepatics that rely on habitats created by other living bryophytes and 'avoidance strategy' for those hepatics that instead prefer peat or litter as the substratum. Frequently fertile Cephalozia species are adapted to the latter strategy whereas species that are usually sterile coexist predominantly with Sphagnum. Hepatics grow more often among Sphagnum spp. in the sections Sphagnum and Acutifolia than in the section Cuspidata.

AB  - Mineral carbonation reactions consume CO2 and thus have the potential for the long-term fixation of atmo-spheric CO2. This paper explores the possibility of integrating industrial-scale carbon storage into mining opera-tions. Ultramafic rocks are typically considered to be one the most promising rocks for carbon capture and storage owing to their high content of Mg-bearing silicate minerals, such as forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4). Beyond the thermodynamic considerations showing that magnesite (MgCO3) and quartz (SiO2) form from forsterite and serpentine alteration, the degree to which CO2 is carbonated depends on the kinetics of the reaction. For industrial carbon capture and storage to be viable, reasonable carbonation effi-ciency has to be achieved. To this effect, the reaction rates have to be increased, which can be achieved either by increasing the reactive surface area, increasing the reaction temperature, or using reagents to drive the reac-tions. However, these approaches are usually energy demanding or not efficient enough.As part of its activities, the mining industry excavates tens or hundreds of million metric tons of rock per mine and in certain areas these mafic rock groups can represent a significant percentage of the waste material left on the surface. This could represent a locally important source of readily available material for carbon capture and storage if the conversion process is sufficiently efficient. To test and quantify the carbonation potential of mine waste, a sample of serpentine skarn waste rock obtained from an iron ore mine in Sweden was reacted for 60 weeks in a laboratory humidity-cell test (HCT) at 20 degrees C. The results show the dissolution of olivine, the precipitation of serpentine, an increase in the neu-tralization potential of the sample, and the appearance of inorganic carbon during the 60 weeks of testing. At ambient temperatures the sluggish precipitation kinetics of secondary phases will favor the formation of more hydrous Mg silicate phases, such as serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4), in place of Mg-bearing carbonates. This reaction lowers considerably the efficiency of forsterite carbonation, as only 25% of the Mg released from forsterite dissolution to form carbonate minerals. This study aims to model the carbonation efficiency of Mg silicates through the use of models supported by laboratory testwork and taking the example of a mine site in northern Sweden.This study evaluates the reaction of CO2 with Mg-bearing silicate rocks and the demonstration that carbon-ation reactions occur with Mg silicate wastes consuming CO2. Consequently, weathering of waste rock may well represent an important sink for carbon in the environment.

AB  - This article analyses competing, emerging visions on the role and governance of negative emissions technologies (NETs) in Sweden. Using the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, we explore different visions of NETs, how they relate to each other and how prevailing socioeconomic interests constrain their prospects for institutional stabilisation. Through an interpretive and qualitative analysis of interviews and publicly available documents, we identify various negative emission imaginaries that differ in their degree of contestation and institutionalisation. We find relatively high agreement on the desirable role of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in Swedish energy systems, while measures in the land-use sector appear more contested. These differences can be attributed to conflicts/alignment with existing imaginaries of the bioeconomy in Sweden, with energy systems already highly oriented towards bioenergy use, and with the political and economic interests that underlie these conditions.

AB  - Natural disturbances (windthrow, bark beetle, and fire) have reduced forest cover in the Tatra National Park (Slovakia) by 50% since the year 2004. We analyzed carbon fluxes and streamflow ten years after the forest destruction in three small catchments which differ in size, land cover, disturbance type and post-disturbance management. Point-wise CO2 fluxes were estimated by chamber methods for vegetation-dominated land-use types and extrapolated over the catchments using the site-specific regressions with environmental variables. Streamflow characteristics in the pre- and post-disturbance periods (water years of 1965-2004 and 2005-2014, respectively) were compared to identify changes in hydrological cycle initiated by the disturbances. Mature Norway spruce forest which was carbon neutral, turned to carbon source (330 +/- 98 gC m(-2) y(-1)) just one year after the wind disturbance. After ten years most of the windthrow sites acted as carbon sinks (from -341 +/- 92.1 up to -463 +/- 178 gC m(-2) y(-1)). In contrast, forest stands strongly infested by bark beetles regenerated much slowly and on average emitted 495 +/- 176 gC m(-2) year(-1). Ten years after the forest destruction, annual carbon balance in studied catchments was almost neutral in the least disturbed catchment. Carbon uptake notably exceeded its release in the most severely disturbed catchment (by windthrow and fire), where net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was -206 +/- 115 gC m(-2). The amount of sequestered carbon in studied catchments was driven by the extent of fast-growing successional vegetation cover (represented by the leaf area index LAI) rather than by the disturbance or vegetation types. Different post-disturbance management has not influenced the carbon balance yet. Streamflow characteristics did not indicate significant changes in the hydrological cycle. However, greater cumulative decadal runoff, different median monthly flows and low flows and the greater number of flow reversals in the in the first years after the windthrow in two severely affected catchments could be partially related to the influence of the disturbances.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) involves complex and interactive processes that ultimately determine soil carbon (C) storage, making it difficult to identify clear patterns. To solve these problems, we used the ARMOSA process-based crop model to simulate the contribution of different CA components (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with crop residues and/or cover crops, and diversification of plant species) to soil organic carbon stock (SOC) sequestration at 0-30 cm soil depth and to compare it with SOC evolution under conventional agricultural practices. We simulated SOC changes in three sites located in Central Asia (Almalybak, Kazakhstan), Northern Europe (Jokioinen, Finland) and Southern Europe (Lombriasco, Italy), which have contrasting soils, organic carbon contents, climates, crops and management intensity. Simulations were carried out for the current climate conditions (1998-2017) and future climatic scenario (period 2020-2040, scenario Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 6.0).
   Five cropping systems were simulated: conventional systems under ploughing with monoculture and residues removed (Conv - R) or residues retained (Conv + R); no-tillage (NT); CA and CA with a cover crop, Italian ryegrass (CA + CC). In Conv - R, Conv + R and NT, the simulated monocultures were spring barley in Almalybak and Jokioinen, and maize in Lombriasco. In all sites, conventional systems led to SOC decline of 170-1000 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), whereas NT can slightly increase the SOC. CA and CA + CC have the potential for a C sequestration rate of 0.4% yr(-1) or higher in Almalybak and Jokioinen, and thus, the objective of the "4 per 1000" initiative can be achieved. Cover crops (in CA + CC) have a potential for a C sequestration rate of 0.36-0.5% yr(-1) in Southern Finland and in Southern Kazakhstan under the current climate conditions, and their role will grow in importance in the future. Even if in Lombriasco it was not possible to meet the "4 per 1000", there was a SOC increase under CA and CA + CC. In conclusion, the simultaneous adoption of all the three CA principles becomes more and more relevant in order to accomplish soil C sequestration as an urgent action to combat climate change and to ensure food security.

AB  - Soft-sediment macrobenthos data from the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf was used to study faunal patterns and spatial variability, and to evaluate different measures of marine biodiversity. Water depth and sediment characteristics were remarkably uniform over the spatial sampling scale of 130 x 70 km, and relations between measured environmental variables and community structure were weak. Out of 175 recorded species, 10 % spanned the entire sampling area (16 sites), while 27 % were restricted to a single site. The number of rare species was positively correlated with species richness. Common species were widely spatially distributed, while species of low abundance had strongly compressed range sizes. The distribution of species varied among the 4 dominant taxonomic groups: the polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms, Polychaetes were the most common taxonomic group and had the highest proportion of widespread species. Whittaker's beta diversity measure (beta (W), extent of change in species composition among sites) varied among the dominant taxonomic groups and was highest for crustaceans, followed by molluscs. Neither the number of shared species nor the complementarity (biotic distinctness) between all pairwise permutations of sites was linked to spatial distance. However, the Bray-Curtis similarity between all pairwise combinations of sites was a function of spatial arrangement and was the most sensitive measure of beta diversity. Faunal pattern changed across the study area, despite the uniform habitat. Furthermore, faunal pattern and variability changed with scales. The measurement of biodiversity is therefore dependent on spatial scale, and cross-scale studies are important. The abstract concept of biodiversity as the 'variety of life' cannot be encapsulated by a single measure, Distributions of species and community differences should be taken into account in addition to species diversity when measuring marine biodiversity and planning conservation areas, and more than 1 taxonomic group should be studied in a system.

AB  - Central European forestry has started an ecologically-oriented conversion of spruce monocultures to broadleaf and mixed forests. Spruce stands in the mountains of south Poland are replaced mainly by beech. However, there is limited knowledge about the effects of "native" forest reconstruction on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools on a regional scale. We approximated the present SOC stocks and probable total SOC losses based on an inventory conducted on 373 monitoring plots in the Stolowe Mountains National Park, SW Poland, where Norway spruce prevails in 83% of forest stands. SOC pools are in relation to an altitude, soil and bedrock type; however, on all soils SOC are the lowest in pure beech stands. SOC pools in the forest litter under spruce monocultures are twofold larger than under beech. Mean present-day SOC stocks are 202 and 152 Mg ha(-1) (0-100 cm mineral soil + forest litter), respectively under spruce and beech. However, this 25%-difference in mean soil carbon stock between pure spruce and beech stands does not define the real SOC losses followed species replacement on a regional scale. When taking into account the present and target forest structures (evaluated in relation to soil quality, local climate and land morphology) an approximated long-term regional decrease of SOC stock is no larger than 7% in a 100 cm-thick soil profile or 10% in upper 20 cm layer.

AB  - Aerial and land-based applications of nitrogen-based fertilizers to enhance forest growth makes nutrients potentially available to all trees, plants, and wildlife in a given ecosystem and, therefore, may have direct and indirect effects on wildlife and biodiversity. A scientific review of these potential effects was conducted with 106 published studies covering vascular and nonvascular plants, amphibians, birds, mammals, terrestrial invertebrates, and soil animals associated with fertilization in temperate and boreal forests, primarily in North America and Scandinavia. In terms of direct effects, amphibians and domestic mammals appear to be the most sensitive to urea used in fertilization programs. The avoidance behaviour and (or) mortality of amphibians in laboratory studies was species dependent. Ruminant animals, including wild ungulates, rapidly convert urea to ammonia and are susceptible to toxicity following ingestion of large amounts of urea. Feeding on urea pellets by small mammals or gallinaceous birds appears to be minimal as granules are unpalatable. In terms of indirect effects, the majority of responses of understory herbs to nitrogen fertilization showed an increase in abundance. Some shrubs in repeatedly fertilized stands eventually increased in abundance in long-term studies, whereas dwarf shrubs and abundance of bryophytes (mosses and terrestrial lichens) declined. In general, species richness and diversity of understory herbs and shrubs declined, or were unaffected, in fertilized stands. Response in abundance and species richness-diversity of vascular plants to a single application of nitrogen showed either an increase or no change. Repeated applications (2-5 and >5) usually resulted in declines in these responses. Relative abundance of mule deer (Odocoileus Rafinesque spp.), moose (Alces alces L.), and hares (Lepus L. spp.), and forage quantity and quality were usually increased by fertilization. Small mammal species generally showed increases or no change in abundance; decreases may be related to fertilizer-induced changes in food sources. Forest fertilization may provide winter feeding habitat for coniferous foliage-gleaning insectivorous birds in some cases. Six species of forest grouse showed no response to fertilizer treatments. Responses of soil animals to nitrogen fertilization appeared to be species-and dose-specific and are ameliorated by surrounding micro-and macro-habitat characteristics.

AB  - Many attempts have been made worldwide to implement community-based conservation to gain a more inclusive protection of biological diversity and ecosystem services. In a recent national reform, the management of protected areas was devolved from the Norwegian government to local conservation boards. The main goals were to reduce local resistance toward conservation and ameliorate threats to biodiversity. We assessed the attainment of these goals a decade after implementation. We synthesized literature published since the onset of the reform and results from a survey (N = 936). Despite the limited inclusion of stakeholders and experience-based knowledge by local conservation boards, survey data show that community-based conservation arrangements are supported by residents. Conservation has been tailored to the local context by balancing sustainable use and protection, but there are some discontent with the opportunities for rural development. Managers report that biological diversity is threatened in 27% of the protected areas. Climate change and increased visitation are major conservation challenges that need to be addressed by the boards, but their mandate and capacity appear inadequate to cope with these challenges. Few studies have evaluated the conservation impact of the reform and we therefore suggest this as a priority for future research.

AB  - Background: Aquaculture workers are exposed to several workplace hazards. Norwegian fish farming has a high occupational injury rate. This article provides new knowledge about workers' perceptions of their health and work environment.
   Methods: The study is based on data collected in a telephone survey with 447 participants and 35 qualitative interviews. The survey respondents were mainly personnel working at fish farms and on service vessels. The interviewees included personnel at fish farms as well as managers and staff. Data were analysed according to a model that included working conditions and exposures, health complaints and concerns, sickness absence, subjective health status and job satisfaction.
   Results: The survey data show that physical and ergonomic exposures are the most common, and several workers report psychosocial exposures such as stress and lack of control in their workday. The most frequently reported health complaints were musculoskeletal (neck/shoulder/arm pain, back pain, hand/wrist pain, knee/hip pain). More than half of the respondents have concerns that their work environment may affect their health negatively. Work-related sickness absences related to strain and acute injuries are reported by 11.6% of respondents. Eighty- five per cent consider their health as good or very good, and 97% are satisfied at work always or most of the time. Interview data identify several work tasks that were perceived as particularly straining but also confirm the high level of job satisfaction in the industry.
   Discussion: Hazards in the work environment need to be removed or mitigated to prevent unfavourable health exposures. Conflicting objectives in the production process may lead to work pressure for workers. Organisational factors that could improve individual work conditions are avoidance of long working hours and ensuring adequate rest between shifts. Workplace risk levels may be influenced by the design of fish farms and equipment, and hence occupational health and end user needs should be properly considered in technology development.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases stands out as a challenge for workers' occupational health. Measures should be implemented at the individual, organisational and regulatory levels and included in technology design.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle. Changes in SOC storage affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations on decadal to centennial timescales. The C-TOOL model was developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOC storage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both the topsoil (0-25 cm) and the subsoil (25-100 cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kinetics to regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of C-14 turnover. The simple model structure facilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/N ratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn from seven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that the initial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for other model parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied more widely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOL simulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derived from large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changes in SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation. Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, and vertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.

AB  - In 2005 and 2007 southern Sweden was hit by severe storms exposing the risks with current forestry focused on Norway spruce (Picea abies). The reforestation after the storms was largely conducted by private forest owners who were offered grants to support regeneration with broadleaves. The previous practices however remained largely intact, with spruce occupying 90% of the planted area. Based on qualitative interviews and applying the practice based approach this study investigates factors and motivations shaping forest owners choice of species. The analysis reveals that continued reforestation with Norway spruce was a result of path-dependencies of practices strongly supported by the species' superior profitability and a high browsing pressure on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Risk awareness, consideration to forest aesthetics and curiosity were the main attitudinal drivers in favour of regeneration with other species than spruce. Our analysis reveals naturally regenerated birch (Betula spp.) as a viable but previously overlooked pathway to increased species diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United States and Finland have passed laws to classify and manage Arctic wilderness areas, but their national policies are based on different nature ideologies. Finns tend to perceive wilderness as a human-centered idea, while Americans are inclined to see the same land from a nature-based point of view. Rural residents in the Arctic, and especially indigenous peoples, use motorized vehicles for hunting and gathering in wilderness areas. Attempts of southern-based environmental groups to restrict motor use by imposing a nature-based ideology on rural residents in northern Alaska will result in high levels of political conflict. Alaska land managers need to respect the minority rights of rural residents and a study of wilderness policies in Finnish Lapland is instructive toward this end.

AB  - Old-growth forests are important stores for carbon as they may accumulate C for centuries. The alteration of biomass and soil carbon pools across the development stages of a forest dynamics cycle has rarely been quantified. We studied the above- and belowground C stocks in the five forest development stages (regeneration to decay stage) of a montane spruce (Picea abies) forest of the northern German Harz Mountains, one of Central Europe's few forests where the natural forest dynamics have not been disturbed by man for several centuries. The over-mature and decay stages had the largest total (up to 480 Mg C ha(-1)) and aboveground biomass carbon pools (200 Mg C ha(-1)) with biomass C stored in dead wood in the decay stage. The soil C pool (220-275 Mg C ha(-1), 0-60 cm) was two to three times larger than in temperate lowland spruce forests and remained invariant across the forest dynamics cycle. On the landscape level, taking into account the frequency of the five forest development stages, the total carbon pool was approximately 420 Mg C ha(-1). The results evidence the high significance of over-mature and decaying stages of temperate mountain forests not only for conserving specialized forest organisms but also for their large carbon storage potential.

AB  - The information about location and size of past human settlements can give new insights into the analysis of landscape structures. Vodlozero National Park (NP) is one the largest strictly protected areas in Northwestern Europe. We mapped the location of historic villages, which were abandoned in 1958, and studied the effect of past human activity in the forest landscape in two different scales using forest survey data. We assessed the possible change in age, volume and tree species composition from the edge of open fields up to the distance of 5 km from villages. We made a larger landscape analysis using a grid of forest stands covering the whole northern part of the NP. The past human activity was clearly visible in the present forest landscape. Distance from villages affected age, volume and tree species composition of the forest stands. This effect was the strongest within the first two kilometers from the villages. At the level of whole northern NP, the proportion of spruce markedly increased after approximately 15 km from the nearest old village. The changes in the forests surrounding the villages were most likely the result of the intensive use of wood for different commodities needed in households and farming, in addition to short rotation slash and burn agriculture. If the occurrence of forest fires was more frequent closer to villages than in more remote areas, it can well explain the observed pattern in the abundance of spruce in the larger landscape that is less tolerant to fire than pine.

AB  - Bark beetles (BB) are an insect that can become a forest pest and that principally affects temperate regions globally, massively killing tree hosts, mainly coniferous species. When tree hosts are the dominant species in the canopy, BB outbreaks may impose important changes in the structure, composition and diversity of forests, from the stand to the regional scale. In Mexico, during the current century, BB pests have become the main biotic threat in forests where Pinus species are dominant. Questions addressed in this study are: What is the structure, composition and diversity of the forest canopy after BB disturbances? and "What are the implications for ecological resistance and resilience of the forest"? The study site was located in the Sierra Norte region in Oaxaca, Mexico, where more a decade ago BB outbreaks affected the forest. In ninety plots of 500 m2 (4.5 ha) all live trees with >= 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were located, their DBH was measured, and the species was identified. As well, all stumps resulting from previous sanitation logging and timber extraction (TE) were located and for each condition, basal diameter was estimated and the genera identified. For the post-disturbance canopy, density basal area, species composition and diversity (alpha and beta) were estimated. This data plus the analysis of the stumps was used to estimate the tree canopy structure before the BB outbreaks. Statistical comparisons among BB, TE disturbances and condition without disturbance were conducted. Based on interviews with local experts, a rank of risk to BB among Pinus species was established. A total of 4,053 live trees and 547 stumps were found. The live trees corresponded to 24 species from 8 genera. Pinus genus and, particularly P. patula predominated. Seventy-five percent of the individuals had < 20 cm DBH and a J-inverted diametric distribution resulted. Individuals with DBH >= 100 cm were found only in the condition without disturbance. Three of the nine Pinus species, were BB main-host species, and the least preferred host was P. ayacahuite. The three BB main-host species dominated the post-disturbance canopy (including regeneration). In contrast, P. ayacahuite and other non-host tree species dominated in the conditions without disturbance, and the three main-host species showed low density. As well, high species richness occurred in areas affected by BB. Since climate change will likely continue to exacerbate BB outbreaks, it is proposed that to increase ecological resis-tance and resilience forest management practices should focus on reducing density, promoting a mix of host and non-host species, increasing tree diversity and avoiding stands with monodominance of main-host species.

AB  - The preservation of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes in Europe is of great importance. Conservation priorities in semi-natural grasslands in Sweden have mainly focused on preventing accumulation of litter by management with grazing or hay making. The effects of specific management regimes on species diversity of different taxa or taxonomic groups can differ considerably. In this study we investigated how plant and ant diversity and community composition were affected by grazing, fertilisation and topography. The results show that plant species richness was higher in grazed than abandoned pastures but ant species richness was not affected by grazing. Both plant and ant species richness was negatively affected by fertilisation. Neither ant nor plant species richness was affected by topography. No significant relation was found between the total numbers of ant and plant species. Both plant species composition and ant species composition were affected by fertilisation and grazing. When considering management or restoration tools for grasslands it is important to focus on more than one taxonomic group. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-dimensional model, based on numerous vertical and horizontal C-14 datings and GIS simulation from a concentrically domed mire in southern Finland, demonstrates considerable variation in actual (net) rate of carbon accumulation (ARCA) through time. Lateral growth between 9000 and 3000 yr ago accounts for only 25% of the total carbon sequestration, whereas bog formation after ombrotrophication is responsible for the remaining 75%. On the other hand, the most rapid increase in landscape CH4 fur occurred between 4500 and 3000 yr ago, the period of the fastest horizontal growth. In addition to autecological factors, a climatic shift towards cooler and wetter conditions is a plausible mechanism for maintaining accelerated carbon accumulation.

AB  - The ongoing climate change can influence the dynamic of insect populations and therefore the Insect species Responsible for Forest Damage ("insects-RFD" hereafter). The present study aims at identifying the most occurring insects-RFD in Sweden, and exploring the relationships between insects-RFD and climate and land management changes. The recorded insect attacks based on historical reports, literature and databases, were collected for North, Central and South of Sweden, and for two periods at yearly time scales: 1850-1950 and 1961-2014. A series of analyses has been carried out based on this dataset: 1 Estimation of the occurrence of each insects-RFD over years to assess which insect species have caused the major forest damage, 2-Ratios of broadleaved versus conifer host trees to estimate the main types of damaged forests, and 3-Canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate how much climate (winter and summer temperature, winter and summer precipitation, and storms) and land management (land areas for wood production, standing volume for all trees and standing volume for deciduous trees) changes have affected insects-RFD. The results reveal that the most occurring insects-RFD differ between the North and South of Sweden, and between 1850-1950 and 1961-2014. The most occurring insects-RFD since 1850 were Ips typographus, Neodiprion sertifer, Tortrix viridana, Hylobius abietis and Tomicus piniperda. The occurrences of insects-RFD have been higher in the South of Sweden since at least 1850 than in other regions. The North of Sweden have been mostly affected by insects-RFD between 1911 and 1950. Canonical correspondence analyses show that the spread of insects-RFD might be related to environmental conditions. More particularly, the insects-RFD variation explained are increasing between 1902-1950 and 1961-2007 in all Sweden for temperature (winter and summer) and in Central and South of Sweden for storm damage. However, the evolution of landscape management would participate in influencing insects-RFD, in particular from 1961, when changes in forest management (e.g. increase in land areas for wood production) have been developed, as well as the way to report insect forest damages. This long-term perspective of how changes in climate and land management have influenced insects-RFD is of great interest for further discussion about climate adaptation strategies in forestry and ecosystem services.

AB  - Climate solutions relying on forest bioenergy may be in conflict with carbon sequestration and storage by forests as well as conservation of biodiversity. We quantified effects of forest-residue harvesting for bioenergy on both forest carbon balance and biodiversity in a boreal forest landscape. Through a modeling framework, we simulated forest development in four real watersheds with three scenarios: (i) with and (ii) without forest-residue harvesting and (iii) set aside to study the conservation potential of these landscapes in the future without management. We simulated changes in the forest carbon stocks and in the quality and quantity of deadwood resources for 100 years and combined this information with the information on species habitat associations based on expert judgements. In this study, current practices of slash and stump harvesting reduced forest carbon stocks and deadwood volumes at the landscape scale and, consequently, halved the emissions savings that can be obtained with bioenergy. In addition, logging-residue harvesting reduced 15%-21% of the combined species conservation capacity of the landscape for red-listed, saproxylic species compared with forest management without bioenergy harvesting. Furthermore, the results indicated a potential conflict between areas of high bioenergy potential and high conservation potential.

AB  - The consequences of warming-induced 'shrubification' on Arctic soil carbon storage are receiving increased attention, as the majority of ecosystem carbon in these systems is stored in soils. Soil carbon cycles in these ecosystems are usually tightly coupled with nitrogen availability. Soil microbial responses to 'shrubification' may depend on the traits of the shrub species that increase in response to warming. Increase in deciduous shrubs such as Betula nana likely promotes a loss of soil carbon, whereas the opposite may be true if evergreen shrubs such as Empetrum hermaphroditum increase. We analyzed soil organic matter stocks and C-13 NMR fractions, microbial CO2 respiration, biomass, extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), and their association with shrub density in northern Sweden after 20 years of experimental warming using open top chambers (OTCs). Our study sites were located in a tundra heath that stores high soil carbon quantities and where the OTCs had increased deciduous shrubs, and in a mountain birch forest that stores lower soil carbon quantities and where the OTCs had increased evergreen shrubs. We predicted that organic matter stocks should be lower and respiration and EEAs higher inside the OTCs than untreated plots in the tundra, whereas no effect should be detected in the forest. Soil organic matter stocks and C-13 NMR fractions remained unaffected at both sites. When expressed as per gram microbial biomass, respiration and EEAs for carbohydrate and chitin degradation were higher inside the OTCs, and contrasting our prediction, this effect was stronger in the forest. Unexpectedly, the OTCs also led to a substantially lower microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen irrespective of habitat. The decline in the microbial biomass counteracted increased activities resulting in no effect of the OTCs on respiration and a lower phenol oxidase activity per gram soil. Microbial biomass nitrogen correlated negatively with evergreen shrub density at both sites, indicating that 'shrubification' may have intensified nutrient competition between plants and soil microorganisms. Nutrient limitation could also underlie increased respiration per gram microbial biomass through limiting C assimilation into biomass. We hypothesize that increasing nutrient immobilization into long-lived evergreen shrubs could over time induce microbial nutrient limitation that contributes to a stability of accumulated soil organic matter stocks under climate warming.

AB  - Agricultural practices and land use significantly influence soil carbon storage. The processes that are affected by land use and management are generally understood, but uncertainties in projections are high. In this paper, we investigate the long-term effects of chronosequential land use change from grassland to cropland and vice versa on soil carbon stock dynamics in four fields on a Swedish farm. Between 1850 and 1920, three of the fields were converted from grassland into cropland, and one was converted back to grassland in 1971. The fourth (control) field is a grassland that has never been ploughed. In 1937, the four fields were sampled at 111 points in a regular grid (25 or 50 m) and the dried soil samples were stored at our Department. In 1971 and 2002, the original grid points were revisited and re-sampled. Land use changes affected the soil C stock significantly. In 1937, carbon stocks were significantly smaller in the arable fields than in the grassland soil. In the field that was converted from arable back to grassland, soil C increased significantly at an average rate of about 0.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). A soil C balance model (ICBM) driven by standard meteorological data and soil carbon input estimated from yield records described soil carbon dynamics reasonably well, although the range of simulated relative changes in C stocks between 1937 and 2002 in the four fields (from -7.4 to +8.8%) was narrower than those measured (from -19.5 to +16.5%). There are only few long-term studies in Northern Europe available for quantifying the effect of land use change on soil carbon stocks and the results presented here are therefore useful for improving predictions of changes in soil carbon driven by land use change.

AB  - Protected areas provide important ecosystem services globally but few studies have examined how cultural differences influence the distribution of cultural ecosystem values and management preferences. We used internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) in the countries of Norway and Poland to identify ecosystem values and management preferences in protected areas held by regional residents and site users. We found significant differences in the type and quantity of ecosystem values with Norwegians mapping more values relating to use of resources (e.g., hunting/fishing, gathering) and Polish respondents mapping more environmental values such as scenery, biological diversity, and water quality. With respect to management preferences, Norwegians identified more preferences for resource utilization while Polish respondents identified more preferences for conservation. Norwegian respondents were more satisfied with protected area management and local participation which can be explained by historical, legal, and cultural differences between the two countries. For Norway, biodiversity conservation in protected areas will continue to be guided by sustainable use of protected areas, rather than strict nature protection, with management favoring local board control and active public participation. For Poland, change in protected area management to enhance biodiversity conservation is less certain, driven by national environmental values that conflict with local values and preferences, continuing distrust in government, and low levels of civic participation. Differential efficacy in PPGIS methods Norway with greater participation from household sampling and Poland with greater response using social media suggest different strategies will be required for effective public engagement in protected area planning and management.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that densities and dynamics of various organisms often cannot be understood from the processes occurring within separate habitat patches. Effects from surrounding areas also have to be considered; a landscape perspective has to be employed. Habitat mosaics affect diversity and dynamics both in pristine and managed boreal landscapes. There is increasing interest in the landscape ecology of boreal forests and many important processes have been identified as being driven or affected by environmental heterogeneity. Comparisons between ecological processes in original and managed boreal landscapes are urgently needed.

AB  - Climate-adaptive forest management aims to sustain the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB). However, it remains largely unknown how changes in adaptive silvicultural interventions affect trade-offs and synergies among ESB in the long term. We used a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to evaluate popular adaptive forest management interventions in representative Swiss low- to mid-elevation beech- and spruce-dominated forest stands. We predicted stand development across the twenty-first century using a novel empirical and temperature-sensitive single-tree forest stand simulator in a fully crossed experimental design to analyse the effects of (1) planting mixtures of Douglas-fir, oak and silver fir, (2) thinning intensity, and (3) harvesting intensity on timber production, carbon storage and biodiversity under three climate scenarios. Simulation results were evaluated in terms of multiple ESB provision, trade-offs and synergies, and individual effects of the adaptive interventions. Timber production increased on average by 45% in scenarios that included tree planting. Tree planting led to pronounced synergies among all ESBs towards the end of the twenty-first century. Increasing the thinning and harvesting intensity affected ESB provision negatively. Our simulations indicated a temperature-driven increase in growth in beech- (+ 12.5%) and spruce-dominated stands (+ 3.7%), but could not account for drought effects on forest dynamics. Our study demonstrates the advantages of multi-scenario sensitivity analysis that enables quantifying effect sizes and directions of management impacts. We showed that admixing new tree species is promising to enhance future ESB provision and synergies among them. These results support strategic decision making in forestry.

AB  - The carbon balance of forestry depends on the management, assortment distribution of harvested wood, end use of products, harvesting and processing releases, and substitution effects. This study developed a simulation-optimization system in which all these elements were incorporated. The simulation model consisted of a typical tree stand growth simulator augmented with a decomposition model for calculating carbon releases from the decomposition of deadwood, cutting residues, and products. The model allows managers and policy makers to analyze the effects of carbon pricing, substitution rates and assortment distributions, among others, on the optimal stand management, and estimate the carbon balances of alternative management systems. The case study calculations showed that the long-term carbon balance of a managed forest is negative without substitution effects. Substitution effects may convert the balance from negative to positive. The carbon balance of pine forest is clearly better than that of spruce forest, which is mainly because of the poor carbon balance of spruce pulpwood. If there are no substitution effects, forest management is a carbon source with 0.1 t ha(-1) a(-1) of carbon releases from pine forestry, and 0.5 t ha(-1) a(-1) from spruce forestry. With low substitution rates (50% of carbon in biofuel and 33% of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil carbon), spruce is carbon-neutral and pine is a clear sink with 0.38 t ha(-1) a(-1) carbon sequestration. The same sink effect can be obtained in spruce forestry with a higher substitution rate (75% of carbon in biofuel and 67% of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil carbon). (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

AB  - Genus Dicentrarchus includes two closely related, and commercially important species, Dicentrarchus labrax and Dicentrarchus punctatus. These species have similar morphological features in early developmental stages, nevertheless, they have noticeably different growth rates. The molecular differentiation between these species is therefore of interest. Moreover, the assessment of genetic diversity within and among populations is a primary step towards investigating the population structure and proper conservation of wild stocks of these species in Egypt. For these purposes, in total 141 samples of both species were collected from three locations along the Mediterranean Sea (Maadia, Damietta and Bardawil Lagoon), in Egypt. The samples were sorted according to their external features into 87 D. labrax samples and 54 D. punctatus samples. A partial sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was used to barcode the two species and to assess the genetic diversity of the collected samples. For population differentiation comparisons, D. labrax COI sequences representing six European countries (France, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the UK and Germany) were retrieved from the NCBI database and used in the analysis. Among the Egyptian D. labrax populations, only six haplotypes were identified, with low haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity (average H-d = 0.2214, average pi = 0.001), suggesting possible reduction in population size. Eleven haplotypes were identified in D. punctatus populations, with moderate haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity (average H-d = 0.469, average pi = 0.002). The recorded overexploitation of both species could be a reason for the reduced genetic diversity. The studied populations of both species exhibited low inter-population differentiation (average F-ST = 0.035 and 0.065 for D. labrax and D. punctatus, respectively). However, high F-ST values were recorded between the Egyptian D. labrax populations and the European populations (F-ST = 0.626-0.962, p<0.01) except for Turkey (F-ST = 0.037, p<0.05). Special attention should be directed to proper protection and management of the existing diversity of the two Dicentrarchus species in Egypt. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species occupying habitats subjected to frequent natural and/or anthropogenic changes are a challenge for conservation management. We studied one such species, Viola uliginosa, an endangered perennial wetland species typically inhabiting sporadically flooded meadows alongside rivers/lakes. In order to estimate genomic diversity, population structure, and history, we sampled five sites in Finland, three in Estonia, and one each in Slovenia, Belarus, and Poland using genomic SNP data with double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq). We found monophyletic populations, high levels of inbreeding (mean population F-SNP = 0.407-0.945), low effective population sizes (N-e = 0.8-50.9), indications of past demographic expansion, and rare long-distance dispersal. Our results are important in implementing conservation strategies for V. uliginosa, which should include founding of seed banks, ex situ cultivations, and reintroductions with individuals of proper origin, combined with continuous population monitoring and habitat management.

AB  - The long-term carbon balance (CB) of unmanaged forest was compared to the CBs of management scenarios which included cuttings. The calculations were done for a typical forest holding representing mineral soil sites in Central Finland. CB was calculated for twenty-one 10-year periods. Three carbon stores and sub-balances were included in the analysis: (1) below-and above-ground biomass of living trees; (2) forest soil (dead organic matter); and (3) wood-based products. Substitution effects and the releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the CB of products. The no-cutting scenario had the best CB for 120-130 years, after which the cutting scenarios were better. In the no-cutting scenario, the CB of living biomass turned zero after 150 years and the CB of forest soils was still positive after 200 years. At the end of the 210-year simulation period the CB of the unmanaged forest was 0.09 Mg C ha(-1)a(-1) suggesting that old-growth forest is a weak carbon sink. Heavy selective cutting in a mature forest removing half of growing stock volume had a negative influence on the CB of forestry for three decades, after which the balance was better than without cutting. Since the negative and positive effects of cutting have different durations, conclusions about the effect of cutting depend on the length of the time horizon. Because the net effect of cutting is negative in the short term, a short-sighted analysis leads to no-cutting decision when carbon sequestration is maximized, which is a wrong decision in a longer term. When harvested volume was equal to volume increment, the carbon stocks stabilized to 65 Mg C ha(-1) for living biomass, 80 Mg C ha(-1) for soil and 18 Mg C ha(-1) for products.

AB  - Species immigration is vital for the success of restoring degraded ecosystems, but the effectiveness of enhancing dispersal following restoration is seldom evaluated. Running water is an important vector for plant dispersal. Frequency and duration of floods and channel-network complexity are important factors influencing propagule dispersal. In Sweden, these functions have been modified by channelization to facilitate timber floating, thus hampering emigration and immigration of riparian propagules.
   During the last 10-20 years, affected watercourses have been restored by removing barriers and replacing boulders into channels. This is hypothesized to facilitate retention of water-dispersed propagules. We studied the efficiency of propagule retention following restoration by releasing propagule mimics and by placing propagule traps in the riparian zone.
   Retention of propagule mimics was highest in sites restored with boulders and large wood. Retention occurred at both high and low flows but was most efficient during low flows when mimics were trapped by boulders and wood. Waterborne propagules ending up at such sites are unlikely to establish unless they can reach the riparian zone later. At high flows, floating propagules are more likely to reach riparian areas suitable for establishment. According to propagule traps placed at various levels of the riparian zone, deposition of plant propagules and sediments did not increase in restored sites.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study not only demonstrates that restoration of channel complexity through replacement of boulders and wood can enhance retention of plant propagules, but also it highlights the importance of understanding how restoration effects vary with flow. Most streams are restored to function optimally during median or average flows, whereas communities often are controlled by ecological processes acting during extreme flow events. We advocate that stream restoration should be designed for optimal function during those discharges under which the ecological processes in question are most important, which in this case is, during high flow.

AB  - Northern range margin populations of the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) have rapidly declined during recent decades. Extensive agricultural land use has fragmented the landscape, leading to habitat disruption and loss, as well as eutrophication of ponds. In Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) and Southern Sweden (Skane), this population decline resulted in decreased gene flow from surrounding populations, low genetic diversity, and a putative reduction in adaptive potential, leaving populations vulnerable to future environmental and climatic changes. Previous studies using mitochondrial control region and nuclear transcriptome-wide SNP data detected introgressive hybridization in multiple northern B. bombina populations after unreported release of toads from Austria. Here, we determine the impact of this introgression by comparing the body conditions (proxy for fitness) of introgressed and nonintrogressed populations and the genetic consequences in two candidate genes for putative local adaptation (the MHC II gene as part of the adaptive immune system and the stress response gene HSP70 kDa). We detected regional differences in body condition and observed significantly elevated levels of within individual MHC allele counts in introgressed Swedish populations, associated with a tendency toward higher body weight, relative to regional nonintrogressed populations. These differences were not observed among introgressed and nonintrogressed German populations. Genetic diversity in both MHC and HSP was generally lower in northern than Austrian populations. Our study sheds light on the potential benefits of translocations of more distantly related conspecifics as a means to increase adaptive genetic variability and fitness of genetically depauperate range margin populations without distortion of local adaptation.

AB  - Level and partitioning of genetic diversity is expected to vary between contrasting habitats, reflecting differences in strength of ecological and evolutionary processes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider processes acting on different time scales when trying to explain diversity patterns in different parts of species' distributions. To explore how historical and contemporary factors jointly may influence patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation, we compared genetic composition in the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea from the northernmost parts of its distribution range on Iceland to that previously documented in Scandinavia. Leaf tissue and soil were sampled from ten Icelandic populations of A. lyrata. Seedlings were grown from soil samples, and tissue from above-ground and seed bank individuals were genotyped with 21 microsatellite markers. Seed bank density in Icelandic populations was low but not significantly different from that observed in Norwegian populations. While within-population genetic diversity was relatively high on Iceland (H-E = 0.35), among-population differentiation was low (F-ST = 0.10) compared to Norwegian and Swedish populations. Population differentiation was positively associated with geographical distance in both Iceland and Scandinavia, but the strength of this relationship varied between regions. Although topography and a larger distribution range may explain the higher differentiation between mountainous Norwegian relative to lowland populations in Sweden, these factors cannot explain the lower differentiation in Icelandic compared to Swedish populations. We propose that low genetic differentiation among Icelandic populations is not caused by differences in connectivity, but is rather due to large historical effective population sizes. Thus, rather than contemporary processes, historical factors such as survival of Icelandic lineages in northern refugia during the last glacial period may have contributed to the observed pattern.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - The current global carbon budget has a missing sink, which is believed to be in terrestrial ecosystems. At least one carbon sink, wood charcoal sequestrated in soil, remains poorly detailed. We estimate the wood charcoal-carbon content in soils located in dry valleys within the French Alps. Soils were sampled at five sites along altitudinal transects, from the conifer-dominated subalpine forests to the alpine grasslands. The five sites were distributed along a bioclimatic and biogeographic gradient from the southern Mediterranean to the northern continental Alps. The altitudinal distribution of charcoal exhibits the same pattern in the five sites, despite stand fire history, and regional bioclimatic and biogeographic differences. Charcoal concentrations are low (0.01 to 10 g(char) m(-2)) in soils from the current treeless belt. while soils at lower elevation show high concentrations (10 to 2000 g(char) m(-2)). The results suggest that the landscape structure determine the charcoal accumulation throughout variability of vegetation type and fire frequency. Charcoal concentrations recorded in the subalpine belt in the Alps are similar to those of Swedish boreal forests, but are 10 to 100 times lower than values from Mediterranean ecosystems. Dry to subhumid ecosystems contain subfossil carbon in the form of charcoal, which should be explicitly taken into account in the global carbon budget.

AB  - Questions: How does the presence of grazers impact plant diversity at various spatial scales? What are the effects on plant beta-diversity and its two components, species turnover and nestedness? Are the effects caused by defoliation, trampling or defecating?
   Location: Twenty-four currently grazed and 24 abandoned wood-pasture sites in Central Finland.
   Methods: The species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes was studied at four spatial scales: within 4-m(2) subplots (alpha(1)), within 100-m(2) plots (alpha(2)), within sites (alpha(3)) and within the landscape (gamma). beta-Diversity was studied between subplots within plots (beta(1)), between plots within sites (beta(2)) and between sites within the landscape (beta(3)).
   Results: Currently grazed sites had higher species richness at all of the spatial scales (alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), gamma) and higher within-plot and within-site beta -diversities (beta(1) and beta(2)). At the within-plot scale (beta(1)) plant beta-diversity was increased primarily by variation in defoliation. At this scale both turnover and nestedness were increased by grazers. At the larger within-site scale (beta(2)) only turnover was increased, and it was mostly caused by variation in trampling intensities. Within the landscape (beta(3)) currently grazed sites had higher between-site turnover and lower nestedness than abandoned sites.
   Conclusions: Grazing creates and maintains high species richness and beta-diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes, mostly due to high species turnover between patches. Defoliation, dunging and trampling are all important turnover agents, although their relative importance varies with spatial scale. At the landscape scale the currently grazed sites had high species turnover between them, and thus the conservation of all grazing-dependent species requires continued management at various sites, while high nestedness between abandoned sites implies that their biodiversity can be efficiently conserved through protecting the most species-rich sites.

AB  - Wetlands are important habitats for biodiversity and provide ecosystem services such as climate mitigation and carbon storage. The current wetland mapping techniques in Norway are tedious and costly, and remote sensing provides an opportunity for large-scale mapping and ecosystem accounting. We aimed to implement a deep learning approach to mapping wetlands with Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data over southern Norway. Our U-Net model, implemented through Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow, produced a wetland map with a balanced accuracy rate of 90.9% when validated against an independent ground-truth sample. This represents an improvement upon manually digitized land cover maps in Norway, which achieved accuracy rates of 46.8% (1:50,000 map) and 42.4% (1:5000 map). Using our map, we estimated a total wetland coverage area of 12.7% in southern Norway, which is double the previous benchmark estimates (5.6%). We followed an iterative model training and evaluation approach, which revealed that increasing the quantity and coverage of labeled wetlands greatly increases the model performance. We highlight the potential of satellite-based wetland maps for the ecosystem accounting of changes in wetland extents over time-something that is not feasible with traditional mapping methods.

AB  - Long-term decline and depression of density in cyclic small rodents is a recent widespread phenomenon. These observed changes at the population level might have cascading effects at the ecosystem level. Here, we assessed relationships between changing boreal landscapes and biodiversity changes of small mammal communities. We also inferred potential effects of observed community changes for increased transmission risk of Puumala virus (PUUV) spread, causing the zoonotic disease nephropatica epidemica in humans. Analyses were based on long-term (1971-2013) monitoring data of shrews and voles representing 58 time series in northern Sweden. We calculated richness, diversity, and evenness at alpha, beta, and gamma level, partitioned beta diversity into turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species addition/removal), used similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis to assess community structure, and calculated the cumulated number of PUUV-infected bank voles and average PUUV prevalence (percentage of infected bank voles) per vole cycle. Alpha, beta, and gamma richness and diversity of voles, but not shrews, showed long-term trends that varied spatially. The observed patterns were associated with an increase in community contribution of bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a decrease of gray-sided vole (M.rufocanus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) and a hump-shaped variation in contribution of common shrew (Sorex araneus). Long-term biodiversity changes were largely related to changes in forest landscape structure. Number of PUUV-infected bank voles in spring was negatively related to beta and gamma diversity, and positively related to turnover of shrews (replaced by voles) and to community contribution of bank voles. The latter was also positively related to average PUUV prevalence in spring. We showed that long-term changes in the boreal landscape contributed to explain the decrease in biodiversity and the change in structure of small mammal communities. In addition, our results suggest decrease in small mammal diversity to have knock-on effects on dynamics of infectious diseases among small mammals with potential implications for disease transmission to humans.

AB  - Most scientific papers dealing with soil biota do not describe the humus form or even mention the humus type, although it's the habitat of micro-and macro-organisms, and the environment they contribute to create. Traditionally, and to a large extent, even today research into the topic of soil biology is rooted in agroecosystems. The humus context is neither a Mull nor a Moder but is more closely related to the former. In consequence, advance knowledge is poorly suited to the natural humus profile, notably to the Moder way of life, despite the number of studies concerning biodiversity. In this paper, Mull and Moder are taken as examples of contrasting life-styles. These two humus forms exhibit such dramatic differences that they support two different food webs enclosing high levels of unshared species diversity. A spectrum between Mull and Moder can be interpreted as a juxtaposition of hotspots coming from the two humus forms. Such an additive effect may explain much of the soil diversity enigma irrespectively of any other ecological determinants (soil, climate and vegetation).

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the globe is currently warming, with changes being more pronounced in northern latitudes. Understanding the ecological effects of climatic variability is therefore important. There is recent support for the idea that a large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), through its effects on vegetation and regional weather conditions, influences several aspects of life histories and population dynamic processes of several mammal species, including reindeer Rangifer tarandus. However, patterns are inconsistent both between species and within species. Here, we focus on reindeer, a herbivore that inhabits an extremely seasonal environment. We review and discuss predicted patterns of global climatic change in Norway and assess potential consequences for reindeer husbandry. We argue that although it is clearly shown that local and global climate affect reindeer directly (e.g. increased energetic costs of moving through deep snow and in accessing forage through snow) and indirectly (e.g. effect on forage plant biomass and quality, level of insect harassment and associated parasitism), it is difficult to predict a general pattern of how future climate change will influence this species. It is especially difficult to predict how reindeer husbandry (an important economic and cultural activity for the Saami People) will be affected in Norway. Indeed, (1) patterns in life history traits and Population parameters of reindeer vary over space and time, (2) both temperature and precipitation will increase in Norway, with greater changes in the North, i.e. the areas with reindeer husbandry, but the rate of increase will vary with space and seasons, (3) there are several indirect effects of global warming that can complicate the ecological response, especially involving the response of vegetation (e.g. forage on which reindeer depend), and (4) spatial variation, seasonality, complexity of the ecosystem functioning and nonlinearity of ecological processes make any firm prediction uncertain. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the practical and socio-economic implications for the reindeer husbandry industry.

AB  - Forests provide a wide variety of ecosystem services (ES) to society. The boreal biome is experiencing the highest rates of warming on the planet and increasing demand for forest products. To foresee how to maximize the adaptation of boreal forests to future warmer conditions and growing demands of forest products, we need a better understanding of the relative importance of forest management and climate change on the supply of ecosystem services. Here, using Finland as a boreal forest case study, we assessed the potential supply of a wide range of ES (timber, bilberry, cowberry, mushrooms, carbon storage, scenic beauty, species habitat availability and deadwood) given seven management regimes and four climate change scenarios. We used the forest simulator SIMO to project forest dynamics for 100 years into the future (2016-2116) and estimate the potential supply of each service using published models. Then, we tested the relative importance of management and climate change as drivers of the future supply of these services using generalized linear mixed models. Our results show that the effects of management on the future supply of these ES were, on average, 11 times higher than the effects of climate change across all services, but greatly differed among them (from 0.53 to 24 times higher for timber and cowberry, respectively). Notably, the importance of these drivers substantially differed among biogeographical zones within the boreal biome. The effects of climate change were 1.6 times higher in northern Finland than in southern Finland, whereas the effects of management were the opposite-they were three times higher in the south compared to the north. We conclude that new guidelines for adapting forests to global change should account for regional differences and the variation in the effects of climate change and management on different forest ES.

AB  - As forest management intensifies, the conservation of forest biodiversity is a growing concern. Bryophytes are known to represent a considerable portion of plant diversity within northern forests. This is because bryophyte diversity is closely associated with microhabitat diversity. In this study, the influence of microhabitats on bryophyte diversity was investigated by comparing eight different boreal mixedwood microhabitats. The results indicate that bryophyte diversity (species richness, abundance, and evenness) is quite variable among microhabitats. The accumulation of species richness with microhabitat quantity within a forest stand also varies among microhabitats. beta-diversity analyses indicate that the variety of microhabitats has considerable influence on community structure. Frequency analysis identified bryophytes that are restricted to or prefer particular microhabitats. Although all microhabitats are important to bryophyte diversity, decayed logs and rocks supported the greatest number of microhabitat-specific species, and rock microhabitats supported the largest total number of species. Recommendations for forest management, one of which emphasizes the need to recognize and manage the natural variety of microhabitats, such as downed woody material, found within the forests to conserve or restore bryophyte diversity are provided.

AB  - The number of wetlands in Europe decreased by more than 60% by the 1990s compared with the beginning of the twentieth century. Man-made wetlands may be an effective way to compensate for the loss and degradation of freshwater ecosystems. This loss impacts the populations of declining duck species, partly due to a lack of suitable breeding opportunities. In this study, we evaluated duck productivity and invertebrate abundance in 13 man-made Finnish wetlands that were created for waterbirds. Our findings revealed that man-made wetlands have higher duck production than average natural boreal lakes. High invertebrate levels were a key factor that positively correlated with duck pair density, brood density, duckling density of the common teal (Anas crecca), and duck density during the post-breeding period. Our results suggest that man-made wetlands are a useful tool for increasing duck productivity. For upholding this status in the long term, appropriate management should involve maintaining sufficient invertebrate levels.

AB  - Calcicole plant species are vulnerable to acidification and fertilization, caused by deposition and changes in land use, since they are adapted to nutrient-poor calcareous conditions. In this study we used vegetation data (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens) from 1964 and 1985 and stored soil samples from 1966 to investigate long-term soil chemistry and vegetation changes in a semi-natural, sandy calcareous grassland in southern Sweden. In the re-investigation in 2008 we found that increased decalcification due to acidification could not be verified. The plant community had changed from stress-tolerant calcareous grassland towards a community promoted by higher nutrient availability. Furthermore, the cover of species indicating calcareous conditions had decreased. A decline in the cover of species adapted to alkaline, phosphorus-poor conditions may be due to increased nutrient availability, but there were also indications that the vegetation had changed due to overgrowth by woody plants. This long-term impoverishment of the plant community highlights the need for appropriate management of calcareous grasslands, in order to limit the nutrients available in the soil and prevent overgrowth by shrubs and trees.

AB  - Norway Spruce is the economically most important tree species in Europe and has been cultivated in plantations on a large-scale at low elevations, far outside its natural range. In the Bohemian Forest, it naturally occurs in pure stands above 1150 m a.s.l. and as a mixed tree species from 650 to 1150 m a.s.l. An understanding of natural distributions and the diversity along temperature gradients at various elevations is important for conservation, pest management, and predictions of future species assemblages by global warming. Here we investigated the species richness of canopy arthropods in spruce trees along a gradient from 300 to 1300 m a.s.l. using flight-interception traps. We analyzed species richness by combining diversity partitioning with a moving window approach after standardizing sample size per plot. Total richness decreased linearly as the elevation increased, which reflected declining temperatures and a declining regional species pool. Phytophages (herbivores excluding xylophages) were the most influenced. Richness did not peak at the transition zones of the three ecological elevation zones, neither for all species, nor for any of the separate functional groups. However, the proportion of both beetle and true bug spruce specialists significantly increased with elevation and actually doubled in richness above 1000 m a.s.l., where spruce is naturally dominating. Our results indicate that even planted spruce trees at lower elevations maintain high levels of species richness. Further climate warming will promote overall species richness, especially of phytophages, at all elevations. However, spruce specialists may be seriously threatened by global warming.

AB  - 1. Aquatic plant meadows are important coastal habitats that sustain many ecosystem functions such as primary production and carbon sequestration. Currently, there is a knowledge gap in understanding which plant functional traits, for example, leaf size or plant height underlie primary production in aquatic plant communities.
   2. To study how plant traits are related to primary production, we conducted a field survey in the Baltic Sea, Finland, which is characterized by high plant species and functional diversity. Thirty sites along an exposure gradient were sampled (150 plots), and nine plant morphological and chemical traits measured. The aim was to discern how community-weighted mean traits affect community production and whether this relationship changes along an environmental gradient using structural equation modelling (SEM).
   3. Plant height had a direct positive effect on production along an exposure gradient (r=0.33) and indirect effects through two leaf chemical traits, leaf delta N-15 and leaf delta C-13 (r=0.24 and 0.18, respectively) resulting in a total effect of 0.28. In plant communities experiencing varying exposure, traits such as root N concentration and leaf delta N-15 had positive and negative effects on production, respectively.
   4. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the relationship between aquatic plant functional traits and community production is variable and changes over environmental gradients. Plant height generally has a positive effect on community production along an exposure gradient, while the link between other traits and production changes in plant communities experiencing varying degrees of exposure. Thus, the underlying biological mechanisms influencing production differ in plant communities, emphasizing the need to resolve variability and its drivers in real-world communities. Importantly, functionally diverse plant communities sustain ecosystem functioning differently and highlight the importance of benthic diversity for coastal ecosystem stability.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation through protected areas (PAs) is often based on the idea that biodiversity is relatively static. This assumption is increasingly being challenged as species and communities shift their distributions in response to changing environmental conditions. Empirical evidence on the performance of PAs over decades is still sparse or lacking from several environments, although it is needed to understand species dynamics, support modelling of PA performance, assist PA management and ultimately, to achieve global biodiversity conservation goals. In 2021, we resurveyed vegetation of five boreal habitat types (heath forests, paludified forests, sun-exposed sites, mires and eulittoral sites) in Rokua National Park in Finland, where one of the conservation targets is to preserve the flora characteristic of the area. The study sites were originally surveyed in 1945-49, just before the National Park was established. Study sites have also remained free from the disturbances (forest fires and reindeer grazing) typical of boreal regions. We show that the compositional similarity of plant communities between habitat types has increased over time and is associated with the increase of forest species in several habitat types and the loss of many habitat-specific species. Drivers of change were most often linked to ongoing succession (understory closure) and changes in moisture conditions. Our results suggest that without natural disturbance or appropriate management efforts, the original conservation targets may be compromised over the decades. Our study demonstrates that resurvey of historical vegetation data can be effectively used to estimate long-term PA performance, helping to fill in missing temporal evidence.

AB  - Deadwood is essential for species diversity in forests. Forest management has led to the shortage of deadwood in managed forests and, consequently, to the decline of biodiversity. Prescribed burning and tree retention during harvests may promote deadwood formation, but the long-term effectiveness of these methods is not known. We examined patterns of tree mortality and deadwood dynamics following tree retention and prescribed burning in Finnish boreal forests in a large-scale replicated field experiment with two factors: retention level (10 or 50 m3/ ha) and burning (burned or unburned). We monitored 2744 trees individually for 20 years. Deadwood input was initially high after the treatments, since nearly all retention trees on the burned sites and about one third of the trees on the unburned sites died within four years. For the rest of the monitoring period, deadwood input was much lower since the mortality rate of retention trees decreased to a level similar to the background mortality rate. After 20 years from the treatments, deadwood volume varied from about 40 m3/ha on the burned sites with 50 m3/ha retention to about 5 m3/ha on the unburned sites with 10 m3/ha retention. Prescribed burning altered deadwood composition e.g. via the complete mortality of fire-susceptible tree species. Still, deadwood diversity was mainly affected by retention level. Lastly, prescribed burning generated high numbers of snags, which fell rather quickly, with an estimated maximal longevity of 49 years. We conclude that the combination of a high retention level and prescribed burning produces high volumes of diverse deadwood, and thereby has the potential to support the conservation of deadwood-associated biodiversity in managed forests. However, the stand scale continuity of deadwood throughout the forestry rotation period is still uncertain. The application of management methods should be adjusted at the landscape level to ensure the continuity of deadwood habitats.

AB  - The epiphytic lichen flora and diversity on basal trunks of large Populus tremula trees was studied on 22 sample plots in 11 forest areas in southern and middle boreal Finland. The sample plots were divided into four main groups according to the location and human impact on the stand: (A) middle boreal (7 plots), (B) southern boreal old-growth (7), (C) southern boreal slightly managed (5) and (D) southern boreal strongly managed plots (3). The mean values of both the total number of lichen species (31) and the average number of lichen species per tree (13.4) were relatively low on P. tremula, but the composition of the flora was more unique than on other forest trees. The dominance of crustose lichens and bryophytes, as well as the abundance of cyanobacterial lichens, such as Lobaria pulmonaria, Nephroma spp. and Peltigera spp., were the most distinct features of the flora. The proportion of habitat specialists was high on Populus, whereas widespread foliose lichens, such as Hypogymnia physodes and Platismatia glauca, were sparse. The low lichen species numbers could best be explained by the abundance of bryophytes, the dominance of strong competitor species, the high average bark pH that favours few lichens and small variation in the microhabitat structure of the basal trunk. Several differences could be detected in the epiphyte flora between the four sample plot groups, although they were not completely separated by NMDS-ordination. Most of the middle boreal plots formed a distinct group, whereas the other plots were more scattered in the ordination space. The flora of the middle boreal plots was strongly dominated by the crustose lichens Biatora carneoalbida and B, epixanthoides. The southern boreal plots had higher species richness and diversity than the middle boreal ones. The flora of the southern boreal old-growth plots was mostly dominated by bryophytes (Ptilidium pulcherrimum, Sanionia uncinata), whereas the crustose lichen Phlyctis argena was most common on most of the managed plots. The contribution of Populus tremula to the total epiphyte diversity of boreal forests proved to be most significant.

AB  - The abandonment of agricultural lands in Northern and Eastern Europe increases the area covered by first generation forests, which are either formed as an outcome of secondary succession or established as plantations. However, questions remain as to how these new stands develop and what kind of species they favour, which in turn has impacts on their ecological and economical value. Our aim was to compare understorey vascular plant and bryophyte vegetation characteristics between naturally regenerated and planted birch stands on abandoned agricultural sites in Estonia, focusing on the aspects of species richness and forest understorey recovery. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in both stand types but the number of forest vascular plant species was significantly higher in naturally regenerated stands. The bryophyte layer of naturally regenerated stands had a higher species richness, diversity, and number of forest bryophyte species. The higher number of forest vascular plant and bryophyte species in naturally regenerated stands can be explained by the longer undisturbed succession period. The recovery of the forest understorey was unaffected by former agricultural land use (crop field or grassland). The influence of soil properties on the recovery of the forest understorey was not detected, but the number of vascular plant species that grow in forests as well as in grasslands was negatively correlated with distance from forest. Overall, understorey vegetation of natural and planted birch stands did not reveal substantial differences. However, in the case of vigorous natural birch regeneration in the vicinity of forest land, unassisted reforestation should be favoured.

AB  - We examine whether climate benefits warrant policies promoting biofuel production from agricultural crops when other environmental impacts are accounted for. We develop a general economic-ecological modelling framework for integrated analysis of biofuel policies. An economic model of farmers' decision making is combined with a biophysical model predicting the effects of farming practices on crop yields and relevant environmental impacts. They include GHG emissions over the life cycle, nitrogen and phosphorus runoff, and the quality of wildlife habitats. We apply our model to crop production in Finland. We find that under current biofuel production technology the case for promotion of biofuels is not as evident as has been generally thought. Only reed canary grass for biodiesel is unambiguously desirable, whereas biodiesel from rape seed and ethanol production from wheat and barley cause in most cases negative net impacts on the environment. Suggested policies in the US and the EU tend to improve slightly the environmental performance of biofuel production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) Biosphere Reserves aim to be flagships of sustainable landscapes. Many of them are important locations for tourism and leisure activities. We explored the perceptions of short-term visitors and summer residents on ecosystem services (ESs) tied to characteristic habitats of the Archipelago Sea Biosphere Reserve in Finland. During holiday season, we conducted structured on-field interviews with 74 Biosphere Reserve visitors. From these data, we gained information on the visitors' appreciation of different ESs and the selected habitats. We also derived habitat-specific ES profiles. Excluding the reedbeds, most habitats were both highly valued and considered as important producers of the listed ESs. The derived ES profiles were partially overlapping and inclined towards appreciation of cultural services, and the importance of scenery was highlighted. Provisioning services were not particularly appreciated. We discovered several linkages among biodiversity, ESs, and recreational land uses. Certain habitats were found to be in need of protection under high recreational land-use pressure, but also potential synergies were found. Our method introduces an important socio-cultural perspective into the region's land management that aims to find a balance between the protection of the Biosphere Reserve's unique biodiversity and the need to support sustainable local livelihoods and tourism.

AB  - This study summarizes the present knowledge of Finnish peatland areas and carbon (C) storage in peat from 1950 to 2000. In 1950, approximately 8.8 million ha of the Finnish peatland area was still undisturbed and 1.4 million ha drained. In 2000, almost 55% (5.7 million ha) of the peatland area in Finland was drained for forestry, 38.4% (4.0 million ha) was undrained, 0.8% (85 000 ha) was in agriculture, 0.6% (60 000 ha) was under water reservoirs, 0.3% (35 000 ha) was under roads and 0.6% was in peat harvesting or had been removed from the harvesting business (63 000 ha). The change in mire area is considered relatively reliable, whereas the net changes in the actual C sequestration and the actual C storage change from 1950 to 2000 involves much more uncertainty. In 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5960 Tg, which includes 5304 Tg as peat. Since 1950, the C sequestration of undrained and drained peatlands (peat, plant biomass) basically compensated for the anthropogenic losses. The most important forms of anthropogenic C losses have occurred from agricultural peat soils, water reservoirs, harvested peat and DOC output from forestry drained peatlands. From 1950 to 2000, the total C storage of Finnish peatlands, which includes peat and living plant biomass, was estimated to increased by 52 Tg because the intensive peatland drainage significantly increased the total C storage of vegetation. However, the actual C storage in peat decreased by about 73 Tg. The well-defined changes include the decrease of mire diversity because of forestry drainage.

AB  - In order to assess changes in the community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi across the tree line, data on distributions of fungi and their host plants, as well as on edaphic factors and stand age, were collected at two montane sites in the Front Range of the Canadian Rockies. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explore relationships between fungal species composition and environmental factors. Richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased with elevation, in spite of the fact that host plant diversity was highest at the ecotone between the subalpine forest and the alpine zone. Both host plant distribution and edaphic factors were important in explaining the observed changes in fungal species diversity and composition. The majority of ectomycorrhizal fungi found in the subalpine forest and at the ecotone were conifer associates, while a large proportion of those in the alpine zone were non-host specific and able to form mycorrhizae with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. The abundance of non-host specific fungi in the alpine zone is expected to provide a favorable environment for the establishment of conifer seedlings above the present tree line.

AB  - The proportion of mixed-species forests is presently increasing since they are commonly seen as providing a higher level of many ecosystem goods and services than monospecific stands. This may be due to a more complex three-dimensional distribution pattern of plant elements, which has often been noted, but to date rarely been quantified. In the present study, we used terrestrial laser scanning data to analyze the relationship between tree species mixing and stand structural complexity in three regions of Germany. We examined 60 forest plots representing commercially important and typical species combinations for Central Europe. The results showed an increasing but saturating relationship between stand structural complexity and tree species diversity. Moreover, we found that as the proportion of broadleaved trees increased, the stand structural complexity of coniferous stands also increased. Our study provides evidence that the conversion of monospecific conifer stands into mixed forests with broadleaved tree species as well as mixing tree species with interspecific differences in physiological and morphological traits can promote the development of structurally more complex stand structures.

AB  - In Sweden, fire management is driven by nature conservation objectives through both regeneration burning, used as a soil preparation method in forestry, and conservation burning in protected forests, aiming to reintroduce fire as an ecological process necessary for the preservation of biodiversity. The burning strategy affects Indigenous Sami reindeer herders who use commercial and protected forestlands as pastures for their reindeer. Fire can have ambivalent effects on reindeer pasture depending on where it occurs. Yet, Sami herders are currently not included in the planning process of burning but for a consultation by forest owners occurring late in the process. In this article, we interpret fire management as a system of fire domestication, understood as continuous interactions between humans and fire. To describe the modalities of contemporary fire domestication, our study draws on semi-structured interviews carried out with Sami reindeer herders, forestry planners, conservation managers, and burning practitioners in different localities of the northernmost counties of Vasterbotten and Norrbotten. We show how the domestication of fire involves a dual negotiation process: a negotiation with fire during the burning process, and a negotiation about fire between Sami herders and forest managers. Burning practitioners conceive fire as an agent rather than a tool, able to produce unique effects in forests and increase their naturalness, which they must steer in order to reach desired ecological results. Through the negotiation of the use of fire, fire domestication stimulates new interactions between Sami herders and forest managers, and constitutes a possible common ground from which new forms of collaboration could emerge. Our study reaffirms the hybrid nature of fire, both natural and cultural, resulting from negotiations with and between the human actors of the domestication system.

AB  - To examine the importance of management practices and landscape structure on diversity of butterflies 16 farms with organic or conventional management were censused during 1997 and 1998. On each farm a transect route was walked during July and the beginning of August, six times in 1997 and five times in 1998. The farms were located in the central part of Sweden in two adjacent regions with the same pool of species. The organic and conventional Farms were paired with help of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index according to land use to control for landscape structure on the farm level.
   On each Farm calculations were made of large- and small-scale landscape heterogeneity with the help of GIS. A grid with a mesh size of 400 m was placed over each farm and the small-scale heterogeneity was calculated as the mean habitat diversity of four squares. The large-scale landscape heterogeneity described the landscape in which the farms were imbedded, and covered an area of 5 x 5 km.
   No differences in butterfly diversity, number of species or number of observations were noted between organic and conventional farms. Butterfly diversity was positively correlated with small-scale landscape heterogeneity while butterfly abundance was positively correlated with large-scale heterogeneity. Both large-scale and small-scale heterogeneity were important For the composition of species. The landscape structure seemed to be more important for butterfly diversity and species composition than the farming system in itself.

AB  - Since 1987, the use of antibacterial drugs in Norwegian fish farming has been drastically reduced from about 48 tonnes to approximately 1 tonne annually, varying slightly from year to year. The 649 kg active substance prescribed in 2007 corresponds to approximately 0.03% of the produced biomass being treated once with an antibacterial drug. This is an exceptional figure, particularly when compared with antibacterial drug use in terrestrial animal production or humans. It is therefore highly unlikely that this limited use of antibacterial drugs in farmed fish poses a significant risk to human medicine via the development of antibacterial drug resistance. Among the factors contributing to this favourable situation are: (a) a unique government-industry initiative adopted in the early 1990s to facilitate vaccination against classical furunculosis; (b) development of high-quality vaccines by the pharmaceutical industry; (c) the continuing predominance of vaccination strategies for disease control among fish farmers; (d) adoption of 'all-in-all-out' production systems, with mandatory fallowing periods between year classes; and (e) zoning and the spatial re-arrangement of marine production sites to minimize horizontal spread of infections. In Norway, targeted and flexible governance has allowed the rapid implementation of mass vaccination as well as zoo-sanitary measures. The limited use, however, also tends to limit the availability of licensed veterinary drugs in the marketplace. This creates a dilemma that should be addressed as a strategic issue for further long-term development of sustainable industrialized aquaculture.

AB  - In this paper, three biofuel-producing processes with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are studied: two (fermentation) ethanol processes and one process producing methanol (via gasification). In these processes CO2 is captured from streams which are relatively pure, i.e. the main impurity is water vapour which may be easily removed. Owing to this, the costs for CO2 capture, both in terms of economic cost and energy penalty, are very low and these processes could thus constitute some of the first instances where CCS is implemented. The paper highlights under which conditions biofuel production with CCS may create a CO2-neutral transport sector. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Trade-offs exist among the multiple ecosystem services (ES) generated by forests. Generally, wood production conflicts with the provisioning of public-good ES such as the storage of carbon, nutrient retention and conservation of biodiversity. Recognizing that forests generate both private- and public-good ES implies that forestry should be optimized to maximize the contribution of forests to societal welfare. Here we develop an integrated approach for evaluating the contribution of forest ES to welfare. Our approach links the results from dynamic ecosystem modelling to economic valuation and benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the impacts of alternative forestry practices on welfare. We apply the approach to a Norway spruce forest in southern Sweden. We show that current practices are not maximizing societal welfare, because of conflicts in the optimal choice of practices from society's and forest owners' perspectives, and the distribution of welfare between generations. In particular, intensifying biomass production is shown to reduce welfare due to the concomitant degradation of public-good ES, while welfare would improve through expansion of continuous cover forestry. We anticipate that this type of approach will aid the sustainable development of forestry, by informing decision makers of the impacts of alternative forestry practices on societal welfare.

AB  - Thirteen seagrass beds located over a 80-km range in the brackish waters of SW, Finland, northern Baltic Sea were investigated in order to determine the environmental variables important for univariate community measures and for number, composition and redundancy of functional groups of benthic macrofauna. For species assemblages, fetch and shore angle were the best explanatory variables, followed by sediment granulometry (fine gravel) and then sediment organics. Similarly, fetch, shore angle and Zostera marina shoot density were the best explanatory variables for functional group patterns. Small (< 50m(2)) inner-archipelago beds were functionally and structurally equal to the most extensive (500 to > 1000m(2)) seagrass beds in the study area. Community measures (density, number of species and diversity) and functional diversity (number of functional groups) equalled or exceeded levels previously recorded in deeper, non-vegetated communities in the northern Baltic Sea. In comparison with marine seagrass assemblages, the total number of species and number of species per function were low. However, species density and derived diversity measures (Shannon-Wieners index IT) equalled or exceeded those reported for other seagrass ecosystems. It is concluded that in terms of seagrass infauna, the Baltic Sea should not be regarded species poor, as is often generally stated, and that conservation initiatives and management strategies should consider both minor as well as more extensive occurrences of seagrasses in coastal waters.

AB  - Climate change and ocean acidification are anticipated to alter marine ecosystems, with consequences for the provision of marine resources and ecosystem services to human societies. However, considerable uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their significance for societies with the current state of scientific knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders were engaged through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web based survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services potentially impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model which links climate change scenarios to the response of relevant species. Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options. The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and about societal uses and values.

AB  - The authors surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian population (N = 4077) to examine perceptions of biodiversity loss and management, the relative importance of biodiversity loss to other environmental issues, and perceived implications of biodiversity loss. The results showed that 50% of the sample population saw biodiversity as a reality and major environmental issue, and 75% recognized that biodiversity loss occurs. Biodiversity loss was perceived as a lesser global environmental problem than environmental toxins, climate change, air and water pollution, and loss of rainforest, despite the fact that these topics can be difficult to separate since biodiversity loss is a function of other environmental problems. Loss of biodiversity was seen to have negative impacts on people's relationship to the natural environment, to impact environmental resilience, to be at least partly human-induced, and to be an issue of importance and relevance to the general public, not merely to the scientific community. Self-reported levels of knowledge of environmental topics were associated with increasing concern about consequences of reductions in species diversity. The authors conclude that efforts to increase public support for biodiversity conservation can be strengthened by increased emphasis on aesthetic, emotional and cultural aspects of biodiversity.

AB  - 1. The concept of cumulative impacts is widespread in policy documents, regulations and ecological studies, but quantification methods are still evolving. Infrastructure development usually takes place in landscapes with preexisting anthropogenic features. Typically, their impact is determined by computing the distance to the nearest feature only, thus ignoring the potential cumulative impacts of multiple features. We propose the cumulative ZOI approach to assess whether and to what extent anthropogenic features lead to cumulative impacts.
   2. The approach estimates both effect size and zone of influence (ZOI) of anthropogenic features and allows for estimation of cumulative effects of multiple features distributed in the landscape. First, we use simulations and an empirical study to understand under which circumstances cumulative impacts arise. Second, we demonstrate the approach by estimating the cumulative impacts of tourist infrastructure in Norway on the habitat of wild reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus), a near-threatened species highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.
   3. In the simulations, we showed that analyses based on the nearest feature and our cumulative approach are indistinguishable in two extreme cases: when features are few and scattered and their ZOI is small, and when features are clustered and their ZOI is large. The empirical analyses revealed cumulative impacts of private cabins and tourist resorts on reindeer, extending up to 10 and 20 km, with different decaying functions. Although the impact of an isolated private cabin was negligible, the cumulative impact of `cabin villages' could be much larger than that of a single large tourist resort. Focusing on the nearest feature only underestimates the impact of `cabin villages' on reindeer.
   4. The suggested approach allows us to quantify the magnitude and spatial extent of cumulative impacts of point, linear, and polygon features in a computationally efficient and flexible way and is implemented in the oneimpact R package. The formal framework offers the possibility to avoid widespread underestimations of anthropogenic impacts in ecological and impact assessment studies and can be applied to a wide range of spatial response variables, including habitat selection, population abundance, species richness and diversity, community dynamics and other ecological processes.

AB  - In Norway, the world's largest salmon-producing country, reducing sea-lice levels in fish farms has been an overarching goal of government policy since 2013. However, industry innovation has not yet succeeded in significantly reducing the sea lice problem.
   We identify two main types of radical environmental innovation that could potentially resolve the sea-lice problem: in-shore closed-cage production technology, and a genetically lice-resistant salmon. Furthermore, we provide an analytical framework that shows how radical environmental innovations with a "public good" character are least likely to receive private R&D funds. This leads us to conclude that neither in-shore closed cage technology nor targeted breeding towards lice-resistance will succeed in the market unless backed by targeted government intervention.
   Closer examination shows that these two types of innovation have been less prioritized, if at all, in recent policy interventions. First, the government has geared most of financial support towards relieving the risk of investment in offshore innovation projects, although inshore projects might be better suited for accommodating public and environmental needs. Second, this study underscores the need and potential for stimulating sustainable innovation through the genetic route-a point overlooked in Norway's current policy mix.

AB  - This article deals with techno-economic analysis for production of transportation liquid fuel from biomass (biomass to liquid - BTL fuel) under Norwegian conditions, via thermal gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, integrated with combined heat and electricity production. The production plant is fuelled by 150 MW (LHV basis) of biomass in the form of raw woodchips or torrefied woodchips. The plant design is based on high temperature entrained flow gasification followed by catalytic Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The plant efficiency based on FT-crude efficiency, thermal power efficiency, and electrical efficiency was predicted for two cases: with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In addition, it was also estimated for the production cost of FT-crude in terms of ($/GJ) in various plant operating conditions with varied feedstock quality, gasification temperature, and gasification equivalence ratio.

AB  - We present a bioeconomic model for moose Alces alces management in Norway, where two sub-populations of moose are subject to different site-specific mortality rates caused by the spatial distribution of territorial wolf Canis lupus packs, and are coupled by the seasonal migration of moose. The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.

AB  - Research Highlights: The informed decisions on land use require assessment of the impacts of these decisions on the supply of different ecosystem services. Background and Objectives: Scenario modeling can be used to provide harmonized and quantitative information on the impacts of various zoning decisions on the provision of various ecosystem services. In this study, we explored the effects of land-use zoning decisions on the provision of roundwood and energy wood, carbon stock of living tree components, berry yields, scenic beauty and recreation. Materials and Methods: Three alternative forest scenarios were formulated in terms of restrictions on forest management for already established land-use zones by the provinces in Finland. These data were integrated with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data for forest dynamics modeling. Results: In Finland, 9% of the forest land was protected and 9% was under restricted forest management due to legislative decisions, forest owners' decisions, or regional land use plans in 2016. These established zoning decisions resulted in an estimated 17% smaller roundwood and energy wood removals per year in 2016-2025 compared to the estimated wood removals in the scenario without any restrictions. The decrease in annual gross stumpage earnings was EUR 775 million per year. The carbon stock of living tree components in 2025 was 12% larger than in the scenario without any restrictions. Bilberry yield increased due to the restrictions considered in our study, while the restrictions had only a slight effect on cowberry yield at province and country levels. The restrictions increased the recreation value, particularly in Lapland, but only slightly affected scenic beauty at province and country levels. Conclusions: Scenario analyses support informed decision making and the balancing of different forest uses. Harmonized translation of restrictions and the use of standard indicators to model the impacts also support comparisons between the regions.

AB  - This study analyzes the extent to which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may be affected by a plan to purchase private forestland for the expansion of carbon sinks, focusing on how changes in forestland ownership affect deforestation and urbanization and how subsequent changes in deforestation and urbanization affect GHG emissions, using South Korea as a case study. The results from ex ante simulations imply that carbon dioxide equivalent emissions could increase between 17.4 and 19.2 million tons with private forestland purchases from a constrained budget of $750 million, compared with an increase of 34.5 million tons without the purchasing plan.

AB  - The efficiency of potential climate change mitigation is predicated on future costs and benefits and thus heavily influenced by the discount scheme. Dual discounting involves discounting carbon and monetary values differently; stand level modeling efforts show that it improves the profitability of afforestation projects. However, these stand level results may not hold across other age classes and stocking levels. Using a partial, spatial equilibrium model of the Norwegian forest sector, we analyze the impacts of a dual discounting scheme on climate change mitigation efforts. Dual discounting results in less mitigation efforts in the first decades but substantially higher long-term mitigation efforts.

AB  - Seed morphology (testa ornamentation and seed shape) and allozyme variation were investigated in three closely related and partially sympatric taxa of Silene in the Nordic region. Within this region, Silene vulgaris is a widespread weed of anthropogenic habitats. The two subspecies of Silene uniflora are restricted to naturally open habitats; ssp. uniflora has a coastal distribution, whereas the Swedish endemic, ssp. petraea, is restricted to limestone habitats on the islands of Oland and Gotland. All three taxa show a seed ornamentation polymorphism, with individuals producing either tubercled or smooth ("armadillo") seeds. Both seed morphology and allozymes show a separation between the two species Silene vulgaris and Si[ene uniflora and support the present taxonomic treatment of the endemic "petraea" as a subspecies of Silene uniflora. Tubercled seeds predominate in Silene vulgaris and armadillo seeds predominate in Silene uniflora. However, there is considerable between-population variation in seed morph frequencies within taxa. In contrast to the other two taxa, populations of Si[ene uniflora ssp. petraea consistently show intermediate frequencies of both seed morphs. Silene uniflora ssp. petraea has the lowest between-population component of diversity in both seed shape (18-46%) and allozymes (0.8%) and shows no significant geographic structure in any of the character sets. Both Silene uniflora ssp. uniflora and Silene vulgaris show significant geographic differentiation in allozymes and seed morphology. The highest between-population component of diversity was found in Silene uniflora ssp. uniflora, where 17% of the total allozyme diversity and 39-82% of the seed shape diversity are accounted for by differences between populations.

AB  - The article deals with the role of knowledge in discursive interpretations of an environmental conflict. The research is embellished through a special case study of the debate on the water eutrophication problem and the fish farming industry in the Finnish Archipelago Sea in southwest (SW) Finland. The main question addressed in the article concerns the competing definitions of the eutrophication problem and its spatial dimensions, and the possible implications these definitions have on the political efforts to solve the problem. My focus lies on the role of knowledge as a resource in the struggle over the definition. Accordingly, I will ask how the actors' frames and knowledge are connected with their position within the power hierarchy, and their relation with the study area.
   The results illustrate the dependence of the environmental debate on scientific research, but they also show the lay people's ambivalent attitude to science. The several gaps, uncertainties and controversies in the knowledge base allow interest groups to select the research results that support their view and challenge other scientific interpretations or to oppose environmental restrictions by referring to uncertainties of knowledge,
   Tensions are revealed between local and translocal views and several forms of knowledge. Disagreements do not arise, however, between pure, separate forms of knowledge. Particularly the fish farmers' discursive repertoire holds ingredients provided by traditional knowledge, knowledge based on their own experiences, knowledge produced in co-operation with researchers and popularised science.
   The results show how the lay persons' mistrust in scientific knowledge is linked with their critical attitudes towards the motives, interests and values of outside actors. The mistrust implies a strong spatial element, an experienced outside threat to local identity, way of life and traditional user rights of natural resources. Producers and users of scientific research are seen as part of the complex of social and cultural power representing urban recreation interests, ecological fundamentalism and an alienated connection with nature.

AB  - Applying biogeographical insights to the regulation of production forestry and the determination of forest reserve strategies is expected to increase the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation actions. Here, we assess the extent to which such applications take place. By using Sweden as a case study, we demonstrate fundamental differences among biogeographical regions in natural patterns and processes, past land-use, and anthropogenic impacts that need to be better incorporated into strategic conservation planning and decisions. Furthermore, assessment of specific forestry regulations and biogeographical variation in a number of other countries/provinces embracing boreal and temperate biomes also indicate that natural boundaries are insufficiently considered in forest management policies. We suggest that a substantial potential exists to better align conservation priorities with biogeographical characteristics. To illustrate the application of such an approach, we present a decision support model on how forest conservation policies that rest on natural boundaries and ecological processes can be developed.

AB  - MuskratsOndatra zibethicusare reported to have wide-ranging effects on wetland habitats, sometimes earning them the labels 'keystone species' or 'ecosystem engineers'. We conducted an extensive review of the scientific literature and evaluated evidence for muskrats as potential keystone species or ecosystem engineers, and more generally, their known impacts on wetland ecosystems. We identified 363 publications (peer-reviewed articles, books, theses, and reports) regarding muskrats, 202 of which were in an ecological context. Only 6% (n = 13) of these explicitly considered muskrats as ecosystem engineers (n = 9) or keystone species (n = 4). Our review found that muskrat populations may have broad effects on both wetland flora and fauna. However, studies generally occurred over small spatiotemporal scales and used dissimilar methods and reporting, which limited our inference regarding muskrats' influence on wetland ecosystems. Research explicitly identifying muskrats as ecosystem engineers or keystone species is limited, but published evidence suggests that muskrats may have an effect on plant species diversity and habitat heterogeneity, which in turn may influence other animal species. However, long-term and experimental research is needed to uncover impacts that muskrats have on ecosystems.

AB  - The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) population in Sweden went through a drastic decline in population size between the 1950s and 1980s, caused mostly by anthropogenic factors such as high hunting pressure and the introduction of environmental toxic chemicals into the otter's habitats. However, after the bans of PCBs and DDT in the 1970s, the population began to recover in the 1990s. This study compares microsatellite data across twelve loci from historical and contemporary otter samples to investigate whether there has been a change in population structure and genetic diversity across time in various locations throughout Sweden. The results suggest that otters in the south were more severely affected by the bottleneck, demonstrated by a decline in genetic diversity and a shift in genetic composition. In contrast, the genetic composition in otters from northern Sweden remained mostly unchanged, both in terms of population structure and diversity. This suggests that the decline was not uniform across the country. Moreover, our analyses of historical samples provide an overview of the level of genetic variation and population structure that existed prior to the bottleneck, which may be helpful for the future management and conservation of the species.

AB  - Old-growth forests are widely recognised for the benefits they provide for biodiversity; however, a more comprehensive understanding of their role in climate change mitigation must still be established to find the optimal balance between different forest ecosystem services at a national or regional scale. Very few studies have assessed carbon pools in old-growth Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)-dominated boreal forests, and none have been conducted in hemiboreal forests. Therefore, we assessed the carbon storage of the living tree biomass, deadwood, forest floor (soil organic horizon, including all litter and decomposed wood), and mineral soil in 25 hemiboreal old-growth (163-218 years) unmanaged Scots pine stands in Latvia. The studied stands were without known records of any major natural or human-made disturbance in the visible past. Our results show, that the total ecosystem carbon pool (excluding ground vegetation) was 291.2 +/- 54.2 Mg C ha(-1), which was primarily composed of living tree biomass (59%), followed by mineral soil (31%), deadwood (5%), and the forest floor (5%). Within the studied stand age group, the total carbon pool remained stable; however, interchanges among the carbon pools, i.e., living biomass and laying deadwood, did occur.

AB  - We present the results of an inventory and status assessment of alien species in Norway. The inventory covered all known multicellular neobiota, 2496 in total, 1039 of which were classified as naturalised. The latter constitute c. 3% of all species known to be stably reproducing in Norway. These figures are higher than expected from Norway's latitude, which may be due a combination of climatic and historical factors, as well as sampling effort. Most of the naturalised neobiota were plants (71%), followed by animals (21%) and fungi (8%). The main habitat types colonised were open lowlands (79%), urban environments (52%) and woodlands (42%). The main areas of origin were Europe (67%), North America (15%) and Asia (13%). For most taxa, the rate of novel introductions seems to have been increasing during recent decades. Within Norway, the number of alien species recorded per county was negatively correlated with latitude and positively correlated with human population density. In the high-Arctic territories under Norwegian sovereignty, i.e. Svalbard and Jan Mayen, 104 alien species were recorded, of which 5 were naturalised.

AB  - Modern agriculture's dependence on the intensive use of inputs, such as chemical fertiliser and pesticides, leads to high environmental impacts and, possibly, vulnerability in food security, since most of these inputs are im-ported from other countries. This calls for more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices. Diversification of crop rotations, e.g. by including perennial leys, enhances provision of ecosystem services, leading to healthier crops and increased yields. Perennial crops also increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, which is interesting from a global warming mitigation perspective. In addition, legume-rich leys can utilise atmospheric nitrogen (N) through symbiotic association with N2-fixing bacteria. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of short-term perennial leys in rotation on cropping system performance over long periods and under different conditions. In this study, we used data from three sites in a long-term experiment in Sweden (initiated in the 1960 s), in combination with Life Cycle Assessment methodology, to assess the environmental and yield effect of including ley in crop rotations. Two N fertiliser regimes (High, Low) in combination with three six-year crop rotations, consisting of either i) two-year mixed grass-legume ley, ii) two-year pure grass ley or iii) annual crops without ley, were compared. Environmental impacts (climate impact, energy resource depletion, eutrophication poten-tial) of the different combinations were quantified per kg harvested crop (expressed in cereal units, CU) and per hectare. The lowest environmental impact, at all sites, was found for the crop rotation with two-year mixed ley under the Low N regime. On average, this combination resulted in 329 g lower GHG emissions per kg CU than the crop rotation without ley and Low N, primarily due to lower input of chemical N fertiliser, which reduced the impact from fertiliser production and soil N2O emissions. Comparison of mean SOC change over the study period revealed reduced SOC stocks for all rotations and all sites, especially in the rotation without ley. Therefore, including short-term perennial leys, especially leys containing legume species, in crop rotations can be a useful tool in meeting policy targets on reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture, and in reducing the dependence on purchased agricultural commodities. However, despite the potential benefits of rotational leys, the market demand for the produced ley biomass may be insufficient. Hence, incentives to increase demand are necessary to promote large-scale adoption, for example, for use in bioenergy production and feed.

AB  - Awareness of the importance of the presence of deadwood in forest ecosystems has increased in recent decades. Today, deadwood is not only recognized as a key element in carbon sequestration, nutrient supply and water retention, but is also known to be a reservoir of saproxylic species (species associated with the decay of wood on living and dead trees). The amount of deadwood in clear-cut forest is currently higher than 100 years ago. The issue of how much deadwood and of what quality (including size) there should be in order to promote the conservation of saproxylic biodiversity and sustainable forest management is still vivid. Mycological analyses to determine (i) structure of fungal communities in Scots pine wood debris, (ii) sources and reservoirs of fungi, (iii) nutritional preferences of fungi, and (iv) potential rate and dynamics of wood decomposition were carried out on an 'old' and 'fresh' wood (stumps, branches and boughs) from Jedwabno Forest District (north-eastern Poland). Fungi from 62 wood samples were isolated on two artificial media (PDA and SNA) and identified according to their morphology. Eleven species of Zygomycota, 79 of Ascomycota and 15 of Basidiomycota were detected. The majority of species (91%) colonized many samples. Only 9% of species colonized single samples only. The most common species, with high rates of colonization, included Acremonium spp., Alternaria sp., Aspergillus spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Gladosporium spp., Epicoccum nigrum, Lecythophora spp., Mariannaea elegans, Ophiostoma + Sporothrix spp., Penicillium spp., Phialocephala spp., Phialophora spp., Phlebiopsis gigantea, Phoma spp., Sarodadium strictum, Scytalidium lignicola, Sydowia polyspora, Trichoderma spp. (mainly T. harzianum and T. viride) and Umbelopsis spp. A few species occurred only on stumps or only on branches. More species occurred on 'old' wood than on 'fresh' wood. The average level of sample colonization by a single fungal species was higher (non-significantly) on 'old' than on 'fresh' wood, and on branches than on stumps. The results show that deadwood is a habitat for many fungal species that occur in succession. The presence of deadwood in clear-cut forest and in its neighborhood is necessary for the conservation of saproxylic fungal diversity and ecological sustainability of forests.

AB  - Short-rotation energy forestry is one of the potential ways for management of abandoned agricultural areas. It helps sequestrate carbon and mitigate human-induced climate changes. Owing to symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation by actinomycetes and the soil fertilizing capacity and fast biomass growth of grey alders, the latter can be suitable species for short-rotation forestry. In our study of a young grey alder stand (Alnus incana (L) Moench) on abandoned arable land in Estonia we tested the following hypotheses: (1) afforestation of abandoned agricultural land by grey alder significantly affects the soil nitrogen (N) status already during the first rotation period: (2) input of symbiotic fixation covers an essential part of the plant annual N demand of the stand; (3) despite a considerable N input into the ecosystem of a young alder stand, there will occur no significant environmental hazards (N leaching or N2O emissions). The first two hypotheses can be accepted: there was a significant increase in N and C content in the topsoil (from 0.11 to 0.14%, and from 1.4 to 1.7%, respectively), and N fixation (151.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) covered about 74% of the annual N demand of the stand. The third hypothesis met support as well: N2O emissions (0.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were low, while most of the annual gaseous N losses were in the form of N2 (73.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Annual average NO3-N leaching was 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) but the N that leached from topsoil accumulated in deeper soil layers. The soil acidifying effect of alders was clearly evident: during the 14-year period soil acidity increased 1.3 units in the upper 0-10 cm topsoil layer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Livestock farming systems are major sources of trace gases contributing to emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), i.e. N2O accounts for 10% and CH4 for 30% of the anthropogenic contributions to net global warming. This paper presents scenario assessments of whole-system effects of technologies for reducing GHG emissions from livestock model farms using slurry-based manure management. Changes in housing and storage practice, mechanical separation, and incineration of the solid fraction derived from separation were evaluated in scenarios for Sweden, Denmark, France, and Italy. The results demonstrated that changes in manure management can induce significant changes in CH4 and N2O emissions and carbon sequestration, and that the effect of introducing environmental technologies may vary significantly with livestock farming practice and interact with climatic conditions. Shortening the in-house manure storage time reduced GHG emissions by 0-40%. The largest GHG reductions of 49 to, in one case, 82% were obtained with a combination of slurry separation and incineration, the latter process contributing to a positive GHG balance of the system by substituting fossil fuels. The amount and composition of volatile solids (VS) and nitrogen pools were main drivers in the calculations performed, and requirements to improve the assessment of VS composition and turnover during storage and in the field were identified. Nevertheless, the results clearly showed that GHG emission estimates will be unrealistic, if the assumed manure management or climatic conditions do not properly represent a given country or region. The results also showed that the mitigation potential of specific manure management strategies and technologies varied depending on current management and climatic conditions.

AB  - Although the European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is regarded as a keystone species for the biodiversity of northern Europe, its mechanisms of regeneration and persistence under old-growth conditions without large-scale disturbances have remained obscure. The aim of this paper is to describe the long-term dynamics and regeneration of European aspen in the old-growth forests of the Koli National Park, eastern Finland, in order to gain a better understanding of the occurrence of this species under natural forest conditions. The park includes both natural forests and forests that were previously managed. The long-term occurrence of aspen populations was determined on the basis of inventory data available for the years 1910, 1936 and 2004. Aspen is shown to have occurred at least temporarily over 34 per cent of the total forest area (840 ha). In addition, 13 per cent of the forest area continuously supported stands that contained large aspen trees between 1910 and 2004. In areas where no management took place (6.4 per cent of the area), about one-third of all the aspen stands contained large trees and persisted throughout the period. The results show that aspen can maintain long-term occurrence in old-growth forests and that the species is not only transient or confined to young successional stages. Areas where aspen regeneration is possible, as deduced from its long-term occurrence should be regarded as highly valuable for biodiversity because they offer long-term habitats for several threatened species that are associated with aspen trees. Recent changes in ecological conditions, however, may affect this in the future. Most notably, the increased population of large mammalian browsers may make aspen regeneration more difficult and should be taken into account when restoration and management measures are planned.

AB  - In this paper a method is presented for comparison of the cost effectiveness of mitigation of net emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), by measures carried out in different parts of the carbon cycle. The method is applied on forest production and wood fuels. Two roles are distinguished for forests in the carbon cycle: the role of biomass build-up, e.g. the process to fix carbon into biomass from CO2 in the atmosphere, and the role of a carbon store in wood and other biomass to be used asa sink or asa source for wood fuels. The two roles are interdependent and are related to the age of trees and other conditions of the forest stands, and can be influenced by forestry activities. The costs of reducing CO2 emissions by using wood fuels substituting fossil fuels are analysed and presented for a situation represented by the Swedish district heating system. It was found that the costs of replacing fossil fuels by biofuels generally are considerably lower than the corresponding level of the Swedish taxes on fossil fuels. In some cases wood fuels were found to be cheaper than fossil fuels irrespective of taxes. Comparisons between the costs of mitigation measures to reduce CO2 net emissions by wood fuel combustion and those aiming at increased storage of carbon in the forests strongly indicate that combustion measures are more cost effective, especially in a long perspective.

AB  - Understanding how governance structures align to ecological processes in a landscape is critical for effective management of ecological resources. Ecological resources are not independent from each other, instead they are interconnected, and their well-being is often critically dependent on upholding ecological connectivity, especially in times of change and disturbances. Coordination and collaboration among managing actors, each managing their own piece of the puzzle, is therefore essentially a requirement for effective management. We present a conceptual model that includes ecological resources, managing and coordinating actors, along with an explicit representation on how all these entities are connected to each other. We apply this model to 25 municipalities that manage 408 wetlands in central Sweden. The study shows a good social and ecological alignment, however with a high prevalence for coordination through third parties. We discuss this pattern emergence, its potential implications, and examine which municipalities adopt these coordinating functions.

AB  - Aim Knowledge concerning species distribution is important for biodiversity conservation and environmental management. Fungi form a large and diverse group of species and play a key role in nutrient cycling and carbon storage. However, our understanding of fungal diversity and distribution remains limited, particularly at large spatial scales. Here, we predicted the diversity and distribution of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic macrofungi at relatively fine spatial resolution at a continental scale and examined the importance of variables that affect the distribution of these two functional groups. Location Europe. Time period 1990-2018. Major taxa studied Macrofungi. Methods From observations of 1,845 macrofungal species, we predicted the diversity and distribution of two functional groups of macrofungi at a resolution of 5 km across eight European countries based on 25 environmental variables using the MaxEnt model. We determined the importance of variables that affect the distribution of these two functional groups of macrofungi using the built-in jackknife test in the model. Results Analysis of the modelling results showed that eastern Denmark and southern Sweden are biodiversity hotspots for both functional groups of macrofungal species. Tree species and human disturbance (i.e., the human footprint index) were found to be the two most important predictor variables explaining the distribution of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic macrofungi. Main conclusions Overall, our study demonstrates that tree species and human disturbance have played a more important role than climatic factors in determining the diversity and distribution of macrofungi at the continental scale. Our study suggests that fungal diversity and distribution might change considerably if the strongest predictors (i.e., tree species) were to be affected by climate change and/or human activity. Changes in fungal diversity might, in turn, influence other processes, because fungi are important in driving ecosystem processes, such as nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB  - Microscopic (> 10 mu m) and macroscopic (> 200 mu m) charcoal particles were analysed in sediments from two mires in subalpine coniferous forests at c. 1800 m a.s.l. in southeastern Switzerland. Pollen and plant macrofossils suggest that since 6000 BC, Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata (DC) Domin ('upright mountain pine') has mostly been the dominant tree species at one of the study sites (Il Fuorn). In contrast, forests dominated by Picea abies (Norway spruce) have formed the vegetation since c. 4000 BC around the mire 'Fuldera-Palu Lunga'. Mean fire-return intervals (MFI) varied from 250 to > 600 years, depending on forest type, climate and land use. In mountain-pine forests (Il Fuorn), local fires occurred approximately every 250 years, even before the region was agriculturally used (ie, before 3600 BC). About 2000 years ago, intensified human impact as documented by the pollen record resulted in increased fire activity at Fuldera. Post-fire vegetation dynamics suggest that the mountain-pine stands at Il Fuorn had a moderate fire regime with a mix of surface and crown fires. In alpine ecosystems, the impact of fire is generally overshadowed by with a mix of surface and crown fires. In alpine ecosystems, the impact of fire is generally overshadowed by other disturbance factors such as windthrow, landslides, fungal decay and by climate changes or human land use. Nevertheless, our results show for the first time that natural wildfires exerted a major control on the subalpine coniferous forest ecosystems of the Swiss National Park and its neighbouring areas, eg, by contributing to maintain Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata forests throughout the mid and late Holocene.

AB  - A life cycle assessment of a Swedish short-rotation coppice willow bioenergy system generating electricity and heat was performed to investigate how the energy efficiency and time-dependent climate impact were affected when the feedstock was converted into bio-oil and char before generating electricity and heat, compared with being combusted directly. The study also investigated how the climate impact was affected when part of the char was applied to soil as biochar to act as a carbon sequestration agent and potential soil improver. The energy efficiencies were calculated separately for electricity and heat as the energy ratios between the amount of energy service delivered by the system compared to the amount of external energy inputs used in each scenario after having allocated the primary energy related to the inputs between the two energy services. The energy in the feedstock was not included in the external energy inputs. Direct combustion had the highest energy efficiency. It had energy ratios of 10 and 36 for electricity and heat, respectively. The least energy-efficient scenario was the pyrolysis scenario where biochar was applied to soils. It had energy ratios of 4 and 12 for electricity and heat, respectively. The results showed that pyrolysis with carbon sequestration might be an option to counteract the current trend in global warming. The pyrolysis system with soil application of the biochar removed the largest amount of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, compared with the direct combustion scenario, the climate change mitigation potential depended on the energy system to which the bioenergy system delivered its energy services. A system expansion showed that direct combustion had the highest climate change mitigation potential when coal or natural gas were used as external energy sources to compensate for the lower energy efficiency of the pyrolysis scenario.

AB  - A chronosequence, representing a successional series, was used for the comparison of a hay meadow site managed in an old traditional way for at least a hundred years, and hay meadow sites abandoned for about 10, 20 and 30 years, respectively. Old traditional management included grazing early and late in the growing season, mowing in August and light or no fertilizing. The tree cover was the most important factor deciding the composition of vegetation. Time since abandonment was not completely correlated to tree cover, as some plots had a dense canopy and others were situated in the open. The total species number decreased with number of years since abandonment in plots > 0.001 m(2) and <100 m(2). The highest species number in I m2 plots was recorded in the managed site, with 38 species of phanerogams. Fourtyeight % of the indicators of traditional management present in the managed site was recorded in the site which had been abandoned for 30 years. Frequency - log area curves made it possible to group species according to persistence in the award. As a result, a group of functional indicators of rare hay meadows in the region was distinguished.

AB  - Fertilization experiments done in forest management in pollutant burdened and nutrient-poor spruce habitats cause multiple ecological changes. Fertilization affects population densities and the community structure of soil coenoses markedly so that sensitive groups or species of mites and collembolans (Isotomidae, e.g. Isotomiella minor) can be used as bioindicators for soil condition changes. While pure N-fertilizers decrease abundance, species-composition and diversity, well chosen ''slow release'' fertilizers (e. g. Biomag, Biomag with Bactosol) can positively influence soil coenoses and their turnover activities.

AB  - The impact of historical and present drivers on biodiversity, particularly species richness and abundance, in afforestation areas concerning non-native tree species is still poorly understood. A better understanding is important to ensure appropriate forest management in the face of climate change and increasing demand for wood products. Here, we have reviewed 75 biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, forest management recommendations for maintaining biodiversity, timber production and carbon sequestration in Sitka spruce forests in coastal Norway compared to NW Europe. Due to more focus on non-market landscape benefits and protection sites in coastal areas, transformation of spruce plantations is common. Premature cutting of stands and shelterbelts and clearing away saplings has become the dominant management practice in Norway. Based on the extent of use in Norway, and results from biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, the quality of evidence for the prevailing practice and recommendations in coastal Norway is highly questioned. To reduce conflicts, we propose a more knowledge-based management, a broader perspective underpinning the range of afforestation goals, also including the use of alternative silvicultural methods to increase structural variation in Sitka spruce stands.

AB  - In the time of ongoing climate change and the increasing area of post-mining landscape, the successful afforestation of reclamation sites by suitable adaptive tree species is gaining in importance. One of possible ways may be the use of introduced tree species, which is, however, a controversial topic in relation to risks for forest management and nature conservation. The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the forest stands (age 48 years) of 9 introduced and 3 native coniferous tree species in lowland post-mining coal site of the Czech Republic. The research was focused on production potential, health status, resistance to climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil properties. The highest timber production, biomass and carbon stock (49-95% above average), was observed in case of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra and Pseudotsuga menziesii. On the other hand, unsuitable habitat, insect and pathogens caused poor health status and extremely low production parameters (by 55-62% than average) in Pinus strobus and P. rotundata. In terms of climate, Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea omorika were the most resistance tree species in relation to climatic extremes. Conversely, Pinus rotundata, P. strobus, P. ponderosa, Picea pungens and P. abies were very sensitive to climate events, especially to the lack of precipitation in vegetation period with synergism of high temperature. In terms of soil parameters, the content of plant available nutrients (K, Ca, Mg) was adequate except P deficiency. The highest soil reaction was detected for Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris (pH 6.9-7.1) compared to Picea mariana (pH 4.8). The benefits of "suitable" introduced tree species (Pinus nigra, Pseudotsuga menziesii) are high timber production potential and good adaptation and mitigation of the changing climate; however, native tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua) can provide better environmental benefits on reclamation sites.

AB  - The beetle fauna of 299 sporocarps of the bracket fungus Fomitopsis pinicola in a 200 ha spruce forest in southeastern Norway was investigated in relation to sporocarp, tree and forest variables. The sporocarps contained 36 species of beetles, of which six species are on the Norwegian Red List. Of 12,373 individual beetles collected, 91% were Cis glabratus. Plots of species accumulation curves suggested that there may be more than 60 beetle species present in F. pinicola in the area, but that probably all the specialist Ciidae were found. The major factor influencing beetle diversity turned out to be the level of dead wood at and in the vicinity of the sampling site, with a higher number of species per unit volume of sporocarps in areas with high levels of dead wood. There were also significantly more red-listed species in those areas. Analysing the species occurrence with stepwise logistic regression, we show preferential habitat selection of the six most abundant species of Ciidae. Conservation of beetles associated with bracket fungi using amount of dead wood as a surrogate measurement is discussed.

AB  - This study focuses on the transitional steps leading from a hunter-gatherer economy to reindeer pastoralism among the Sami of northern Sweden. Changes in land use and settlement patterns are interpreted from an ecological perspective taking into account the ecosystem dynamics of the alpine zone. During the initial phase of pastoralism, land-use strategies included the requisitioning of previously unused ecological niches. Exploitation of forest resources near the tree line catalyzed an ecosystem degradation process that eventually necessitated a shift in land use towards more flexible and sustainable strategies. During the period AD 800-1500 a combination of economic, social, and ecological processes resulted in a splitting up of village communities into small mobile units and more sustainable forms of land use.

AB  - Intensive extraction of forest resources lowers biodiversity and endangers the functioning of forest ecosystems. As such, alternative management regimes have emerged, aspiring to promote forest biodiversity and nature protection in managed forests. Among them, continuous cover forestry, (i.e. selective logging), has received considerable attention and is being promoted by some researchers and NGOs. Yet, the full consequences of banning clear-cuts (i.e. rotation forestry) and replacing it entirely with continuous cover forest remains uncertain. We explore how restricting forest management alternatives (either rotation forestry or continuous cover forestry) will affect landscape-scale forest multifunctionality at a range of harvesting levels. We evaluate multifunctionality as a combination of recreational ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, habitat availability for vertebrates, and red-listed dead wood dependent species. Our results show that restricting forest management alternatives have a negative impact on forest multifunctionality at all harvesting levels when compared to the case with no restrictions. Using only continuous cover forestry management alternatives resulted in higher multifunctionality than the case when only rotation forestry management alternatives were used. We also show that maximizing multifunctionality using all management alternatives led to high proportion of continuous cover forestry over the landscape. We conclude that banning clear-cuts does not promote forest biodiversity and multifunctionality at the landscape scale, especially if there is a requirement for high economic benefits from the forest. However, we recommend that continuous cover forestry should be considered as a primary management alternative, with selective application of rotation forestry wisely planned at the landscape scale.

AB  - Background Scenario analyses that evaluate management effects on the long-term provision and sustainability of forest ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB) also need to account for disturbances. The objectives of this study were to reveal potential trade-offs and synergies between ESB provision and disturbance predisposition at the scale of a whole country. Methods The empirical scenario model MASSIMO was used to simulate forest development and management from years 2016 to 2106 on 5086 sample plots of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). We included a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and four scenarios of increased timber harvesting. Model output was evaluated with indicators for 1) ESB provision including a) timber production, b) old-growth forest characteristics as biodiversity proxies and c) protection against rockfall and avalanches and 2) for a) storm and b) bark beetle predisposition. Results The predisposition indicators corresponded well (AUC: 0.71-0.86) to storm and insect (mostly bark beetle) damage observations in logistic regression models. Increased timber production was generally accompanied with decreased predisposition (storm: >-11%, beetle: >-37%, depending on region and scenario), except for a scenario that promoted conifers where beetle predisposition increased (e.g. + 61% in the Southern Alps). Decreased disturbance predisposition and decreases in old-growth forest indicators in scenarios of increased timber production revealed a trade-off situation. In contrast, growing stock increased under BAU management along with a reduction in conifer proportions, resulting in a reduction of beetle predisposition that in turn was accompanied by increasing old-growth forest indicators. Disturbance predisposition was elevated in NFI plots with high avalanche and rockfall protection value. Conclusions By evaluating ESB and disturbance predisposition based on single-tree data at a national scale we bridged a gap between detailed, stand-scale assessments and broader inventory-based approaches at the national scale. We discuss the limitations of the indicator framework and advocate for future amendments that include climate-sensitive forest development and disturbance modelling to strengthen decision making in national forest policy making.

AB  - The identification of spatial associations between perceived ecosystem values and physical landscapes is confronted by a diversity of mapping methods, heterogeneous human populations, and variability in physical landscape classification systems. This study reviews previous research on spatial associations and reports new empirical findings from Norway to describe the potential for spatial "value transfer" methods that extrapolate ecosystem values to other locations. Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem "bundles" supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing loss of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is often debated in the bioenergy context, especially with respect to non-traditional crops that can be grown for energy production in the future. As promising renewable energy source and additional landscape element, the potential role of short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations to biodiversity is of great interest. We studied plant species richness in eight landscapes (225 km(2)) containing willow and poplar SRC plantations (1,600 m(2)) in Sweden and Germany, and the related SRC alpha-diversity to species richness in the landscapes (gamma-diversity). Using matrix variables, spatial analyses of SRC plantations and landscapes were performed to explain the contribution of SRC alpha-diversity to gamma-diversity. In accordance with the mosaic concept, multiple regression analyses revealed number of habitat types as a significant predictor for species richness: the higher the habitat type number, the higher the gamma-diversity and the lower the proportion of SRC plantation alpha-diversity to gamma-diversity. SRC plantation alpha-diversity was 6.9 % (+/- 1.7 % SD) of species richness on the landscape scale. The contribution of SRC plantations increased with decreasing gamma-diversity. SRC plantations were dominated more by species adapted to frequent disturbances and anthropo-zoogenic impacts than surrounding landscapes. We conclude that by providing habitats for plants with different requirements, SRC alpha-diversity has a significant share on gamma-diversity in rural areas and can promote diversity in landscapes with low habitat heterogeneity and low species pools. However, plant diversity enrichment is mainly due to additional species typically present in disturbed and anthropogenic environments.

AB  - Risk of pathogen transmission in Norwegian fjords depends on two main factors: location of farms and the density of fish in each farm. This paper presents a novel method to find the optimal values of these two variables that yield the optimal aquaculture system with a minimum risk of spreading disease and high fish production. For this purpose, agent-based models (ABMs) are used to simulate and analyze fish disease dynamics within and between fish farms in Norwegian fjords. Moreover, a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to identify the optimal values of fish density and farm's location for each farm. The objective function is defined as being the weighted sum between the fish density and the infection risk. We validated the PSO algorithm with the optimal objective function by demonstrating the capability of the algorithm to drive the system to produce an expected behavior and output in tested, known scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the PSO algorithm to converge rapidly to the optimal solution. In only 18 iterations, it finds an optimal solution that is three times larger than the initial fish farm density and in a location that keeps the risk of infection at an accepted level. The use of the PSO algorithm in finding optimal parameter values of ABMs will open for new applications of the model in aquaculture industry management, such as planning for a sustainable aquaculture industry.

AB  - Cities devastate the natural habitats of animals, but simultaneously form new ecological niches and create conditions far different from natural environments. In these new conditions some insects, such as aphids, can develop quickly and they become important pests. This paper presents the population dynamics of aphids inhabiting the Norway maple in the urban conditions of Lublin. Also shown are relationships among the aphid species inhabiting the studied tree. We have shown that aphids are abundant on Acer platanoides and the most numerous species was Periphyllus aceris. This species was clear superdominant in both of the studied sites (the housing estate site and the street site). Using ecological indices allows us to determine that housing estate site is predominantly characterised by a larger species diversity than the street site. We have also presented that weather conditions have a significant influence on the number of aphids on the Norway maple. The highest number of aphids was observed in 2008, which was characterised by a warm spring. This paper is an attempt to answer the question whether the changes in the number of aphids are a result, of weather and habitat conditions, or, perhaps, also of mutual relations among species.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are recognized as widely available and cost-effective mechanisms for sequestering carbon and offsetting carbon emissions. Realistic NbS implementations for carbon neutrality need to be effective at the global level and also appropriate for the socio-economic and physical conditions prevailing at the local level. This paper presents a framework that can help stakeholders identify demands, locations, and types of NbS interventions that could maximize NbS benefits at the local scale. Key processes in the framework include (1) interpolating carbon emissions data at larger spatial scales to high-resolution cells, using land use and socio-economic data; (2) assessing NbS effects on carbon reduction and their location-related suitability, through qualitative literature review, and (3) spatially allocating and coupling multiple NbS interventions to land use cells. The system was tested in Stockholm, Sweden. The findings show that the urban center should be allocated with combinations of improving access to green spaces and streetscapes, while the rural and suburban areas should prioritize preserving and utilizing natural areas. Our proposed method framework can help planners better select target locations for intended risk/hazard-mitigating interventions.

AB  - The understorey vegetation of temperate forests harbours a major proportion of terrestrial biodiversity and fulfills an important role in ecosystem functioning. Over the past decades, temperate forest understoreys were found to change in species diversity and composition due to several anthropogenic and natural drivers. Currently, the conversion and restoration of even-aged coniferous monocultures into more diverse and mixed broad-leaved forests are major objectives of sustainable forest management in Central Europe. This forest con -version alters understorey communities and abiotic site conditions but the underlying patterns and processes are not yet fully understood. Therefore, we investigated changes in the Bavarian Spessart mountains in southwest Germany, where we re-sampled 108 semi-permanent plots from four different coniferous stand types (i.e., Norway spruce, Scots pine, Douglas fir, European larch) about 30 years after the initial assessment. On these plots, we recorded understorey vegetation and forest structure, and derived abiotic site conditions based on ecological indicator values of understorey vegetation, followed by multivariate analysis. We found changes in plant communities that point towards a decrease of soil acidity and a "thermophilization" of forest understoreys. Understorey species richness remained constant, while understorey's Shannon and Simpson diversity increased. The observed changes in forest structure explained the temporal shifts in understorey species composition. The understorey species composition did not experience a significant floristic homogenization since the 1990s. However, plant communities exhibited a reduction in species characteristic of coniferous forests and a simul-taneous increase in species associated with broad-leaved forests. The increase of specialist species (closed forests and open sites) may have compensated for the detected decrease in generalist species. We conclude that the forest conversion towards mixed broad-leaved forest in the Spessart mountains of the past decades might have masked homogenization trends that are increasingly reported from Central European forest understoreys.

AB  - Population demographics of northern ungulates are influenced by density and weather conditions. For caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) that dig in the snow for winter food, snow accumulation and duration of the snow layer are suggested to be influential. Indices based on large-scale alterations of atmospheric pressure such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are connected to climate change and may predict ecological processes better than does local weather. Some empirical evidence of the effects of climate variation is available for Arctic and alpine populations but practically none for sedentary, boreal reindeer. We examined the effects of population density, winter and spring NAO, snow accumulation, and the timing of snowmelt on reproductive success (here the calf/female ratio) and on mean summer body mass of calves in a north-boreal, free-ranging herd of semi-domesticated reindeer in northeastern Finland. In this herd, day of snowmelt explained variation in the calf/female ratio and in the midsummer body mass of calves, more so than NAO, winter snow depth and population density.

AB  - BackgroundUnder the growing pressure to implement mitigation actions, the focus of forest management is shifting from a traditional resource centric view to incorporate more forest ecosystem services objectives such as carbon sequestration. Estimating the above-ground biomass in forests using airborne laser scanning (ALS) is now an operational practice in Northern Europe and is being adopted in many parts of the world. In the boreal forests, however, most of the carbon (85%) is stored in the soil organic (SO) matter. While this very important carbon pool is "invisible" to ALS, it is closely connected and feeds from the growing forest stocks. We propose an integrated methodology to estimate the changes in forest carbon pools at the level of forest stands by combining field measurements and ALS data.ResultsALS-based models of dominant height, mean diameter, and biomass were fitted using the field observations and were used to predict mean tree biophysical properties across the entire study area (50 km(2)) which was in turn used to estimate the biomass carbon stocks and the litter production that feeds into the soil. For the soil carbon pool estimation, we used the Yasso15 model. The methodology was based on (1) approximating the initial soil carbon stocks using simulations; (2) predicting the annual litter input based on the predicted growing stocks in each cell; (3) predicting the soil carbon dynamics of the annual litter using the Yasso15 soil carbon model. The estimated total carbon change (standard errors in parenthesis) for the entire area was 0.741 (0.14) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). The biomass carbon change was 0.405 (0.13) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), the litter carbon change (e.g., deadwood and leaves) was 0.346 (0.027) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), and the change in SO carbon was - 0.01 (0.003) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1).ConclusionsOur results show that ALS data can be used indirectly through a chain of models to estimate soil carbon changes in addition to changes in biomass at the primary level of forest management, namely the forest stands. Having control of the errors contributed by each model, the stand-level uncertainty can be estimated under a model-based inferential approach.

AB  - The growth, structure and production of mixed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests were analysed in the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic. The objective of the paper was to evaluate stand structure, timber production and dynamics of forests with historically different silvicultural practices in relation to climate conditions, management and game damage. The results indicate that scree forests (coppices and coppices with standards) were stands with high-rich species diversity and structure compared to herb-rich beech forests (high forests) with higher timber production. The Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) was the most sensitive tree species compared to low growth variability in European beech. The climate factors had the highest effect on radial growth from June to August. Natural regeneration showed great density potential (13,880-186,462 recruits.ha(-1)), especially in expansion of maples and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.). However, recruits were seriously limiting by damage caused by hoofed game, especially in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.; 53% browsing damage), wych elm (Ulmus glabra Hudson; 51%) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.; 50%).

AB  - Conditions in Sweden for using vegetative propagation and clones for forest regeneration differ from many other parts of the world where clones are used. In this paper, we describe how Swedish forestry takes place under semi-natural conditions, which should be considered when planning for conservation of species genetic diversity. We also describe how the Swedish long-term breeding program is sustainable by combining genetic progress and gene conservation. It involves clonal replication as the standard field-test strategy. In this way, the breeding program continuously supplies a large number of tested genotypes to be used as parents for recurrent breeding, seed orchards and for vegetative propagation of nursery stock. By computer simulation, we illustrate the progress of genetic gain and diversity in reforestation material from the breeding program. Finally, we briefly refer to Swedish experiences of clones in field trials.

AB  - Forest tree species strongly influence forest dynamics and management. French forests have the greatest compositional diversity in Europe, which constrains the quantitative analysis of associated wood resources. A partition of French forests according to dominant tree species composition and stratified by biogeographical regions (GRECO) was developed in order to handle this diversity. The partition relies on forest composition as measured by the national forest inventory (2006-2015, > 65,000 plots). It builds on the J-shaped distribution of elementary composition abundance, identifies dominant compositions describing at least 50% of the GRECO's area, and groups minor compositions. An ecological assessment of this partition and its application to the analysis of the growing stock are developed. The partition describes 61.4% of the forest area (66% of the growing stock) according to 29 dominant compositions, demonstrating its efficiency. These compositions revealed the importance of broadleaved mixtures, and of neglected forest strata (pine species in Northern France). Growing stock density appeared lowest in broadleaved compositions (Mediterranean oaks), and highest in some coniferous compositions (silver fir/Norway spruce mixture in mountains). Partitioning highlights the role of ecological contexts and forest management on tree diversity.

AB  - To reach the Paris Agreement, societies need to increase the global terrestrial carbon sink. There are many climate change mitigation solutions (CCMS) for forests, including increasing bioenergy, bioeconomy, and protection. Bioenergy and bioeconomy solutions use climate-smart, intensive management to generate high quantities of bioenergy and bioproducts. Protection of (semi-)natural forests is a major component of "natural climate solution" (NCS) since forests store carbon in standing biomass and soil. Furthermore, protected forests provide more habitat for biodiversity and non-wood ecosystem services (ES). We investigated the impacts of different CCMS and climate scenarios, jointly or in isolation, on future wood ES, non-wood ES, and regulating ES for a major wood provider for the international market. Specifically, we projected future ES given by three CCMS scenarios for Sweden 2020-2100. In the long term, fulfilling the increasing wood demand through bioenergy and bioeconomy solutions will decrease ES multifunctionality, but the increased stand age and wood stocks induced by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations will partially offset these negative effects. Adopting bioenergy and bioeconomy solutions will have a greater negative impact on ES supply than adopting NCS. Bioenergy or bioeconomy solutions, as well as increasing GHG emissions, will reduce synergies and increase trade-offs in ES. NCS, by contrast, increases the supply of multiple ES in synergy, even transforming current ES trade-offs into future synergies. Moreover, NCS can be considered an adaptation measure to offset negative climate change effects on the future supplies of non-wood ES. In boreal countries around the world, forestry strategies that integrate NCS more deeply are crucial to ensure a synergistic supply of multiple ES.

AB  - In the last 50 years, forest disturbances, caused mainly by insect outbreaks and windstorms, had a significant impact on the subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) stands across Europe. The high intensity of these factors often led to complete dieback of existing forest stands, as in Gorce National Park (Southern Poland). The aim of this study was to monitor land cover changes in subalpine Norway spruce stands and their dynamics in Gorce NP in the years 1977-2020 (43 years), with the use of archival remote sensing data. The study area was divided into two subareas: A-the Kudlon and B-the Jaworzyna range. Changes were tracked in six defined land cover classes, based on available aerial orthophotos and Landsat (NASA) imagery, with the help of the authors' photointerpretation key. The results showed that almost 50% of old-growth Norway spruce stands died in the analyzed time period (50.9% in subarea A; 48.8% in subarea B). However, young forests appeared in almost 17% of the study area (20.7% and 14.2% in subarea A and B, respectively). The dynamics of land cover changes were different for the analyzed subareas; in subarea A Norway spruce dieback processes weakened at the end of the analyzed time period, whereas in subarea B they maintained high intensity. The process of old-growth Norway spruce stands dieback is still occurring in Gorce NP, but it does not result in the disappearance of the whole subalpine spruce forest ecosystem but is rather a generational change, due to emerging young forests.

The socio-ecological dataset includes 1) place-based information on peoples' recreational activities, values expressed as pleasant and unpleasant sites, and negative preferences concerning land use in terms of tourism, nature protection and forestry, and 2) compiled information on scored biodiversity values and protection level of sites. The data are organized in 1ha grid cells. The data were compiled from a rural nature-based tourism area in two municipalities northern Finland. Peoples' opinions were assessed using a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) and the data were merged with spatial biodiversity data from the same area. The data are directly related to the article Tolvanen et al. [1] . Biodiversity data, also utilized in Tolvanen et al. 2020, were compiled from various sources and scoring was done in Kangas et al. [2] . References to individual respondents and spatial locations of markings were removed. The data are useful in evaluating the relationship between people's values and biodiversity.

AB  - Large numbers of wild members of commercially important fish species tend to congregate around fish farms. This effect is in conflict with the interests of fishermen because wild fish cannot be harvested close to fish farms due to the fishery exclusion zone, which is intended to prevent fishing gear from damaging the cages. We studied the potential for harvesting wild fish around a Norwegian salmon farm using three different types of pots. Our video observations showed that large quantities of wild fish, in particular saithe (Pollachius virens), aggregated in close vicinity of the cages. Pots set underneath salmon cages produced 17 times higher catches of saithe and five times higher catches of cod (Gadus morhua) than pots set at a distance of 100m from the cages. The pots set underneath cages also caught larger cod. large rigid pots were shown to be more efficient than smaller flexible pots. The stomach content of small cod was dominated by pellets, while large cod were feeding mainly on saithe. We suggest that dense aggregations of saithe and small cod beneath fish cages were associated with the supply of waste feed, whereas larger cod were attracted by the saithe. We conclude that pots have great potential for harvesting gadoids beneath salmon cages, but catches decline dramatically with the distance from cages. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest management affects soil carbon (C) storage through forest composition, microclimate and litter inputs. How two major forest management systems, continuous-cover forestry (CCF) and clear-cut-based rotation forest management (RFM), differ in their impact on soil C in boreal forests is still poorly understood, however. We compared their effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and quality in boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated forests in eastern Finland. We tested the hypotheses that (1) colder microclimates and continuous litter inputs will lead to higher SOC stocks in CCF plots than in clear-cuts and (2) the more labile litter in clearcuts with varying ground vegetation will enhance SOC decomposition rates. We sampled uncut mature forests, clear-cuts, retention-cuts and gap-cuts, in which we analysed SOC concentrations and calculated the stocks. We measured stand characteristics such as diameter-at-breast height, basal area, dominant tree height, and understorey species coverage of the various treatments and modelled the above- and belowground litter inputs based on these parameters. We used laboratory incubation and sequential fractionation of SOC to assess its degradability under standardized conditions. To estimate the decomposition rate in the various environments we incubated cellulose bags in situ. We assessed the impact of microclimate on SOC decomposition, using data from soil-temperature and soil-moisture field measurements. We quantified the microbial biomass C pool, using chloroform fumigation extraction to gain insight on the impact of forest management practice on soil microbes. The SOC concentrations and SOC stocks did not differ significantly between the treatments, despite the presence of a warmer microclimate and lower litter inputs in the clear-cut plots. However, we found differences in the quality of the SOC. Soils in clear-cut sites showed lower proportions of labile SOC compounds than did the other treatments. As hypothesized, the decomposition rates were elevated in clear-cuts, but were equally as high within the canopy gaps on gap-cut stands. Our work highlights that forest management affects the quality, degradability, long-term accumulation and storage of SOC. We conclude that the accumulation of labile compounds in uncut forests and retention-cuts, combined with the decreased decomposition rates, indicate a higher potential for future C accumulation in the soil than in clear-cuts.

AB  - Cities and urban green areas therein can be considered as complex social-ecological systems that provide various ecosystem services with different synergies and trade-offs among them. In this article, we show that multiple stakeholder perspectives and data sources should be used to capture key values for sustainable planning and management of urban green spaces. Using an urban forest in Helsinki, Finland as a case study, we incorporated data collected using public participation GIS, expert elicitation and forest inventories in order to investigate the guidance that the different types of data, and their integration, can provide for landscape planning. We examined the relationship and spatial concurrence between two social variables i.e. visitors' perceived landscape values and green space use, and two ecological variables i.e. forest habitat quality and urban biodiversity, using hot/coldspot analysis. We found weak correlations and low mean spatial coincidence between the social and ecological data, indicating great complementary importance to multi-criteria decision-making. In addition, there was a higher level of spatial agreement between the ecological datasets than between the social datasets. Forest habitat quality and urban biodiversity were positively correlated and spatially coincided moderately, while we found a negative correlation and very low overlap between visitor use and landscape values. This highlights the conceptual and spatial distinction between the general preferences and values citizens assign to public green spaces and the realized everyday use of these areas and their services. The resulting maps can inform planners on overall social and environmental quality of the landscape, and point out potential threats to areas of high ecological value due to intensive recreational use, which is crucial information for natural resource management. In the end, we discuss different strategies for managing overlaps and discrepancies between the social and ecological values.

AB  - This paper reviews the effects that windstorm-induced drastic changes (micro-climate, soil, vegetation, and ground structural heterogeneity) have on forest insect communities. In the current context of shady and CWD-deprived managed forests, windthrow gaps act as regional biodiversity hotspots by maintaining habitat continuity in a mosaic landscape, and by facilitating the breeding and population growth of clearing specialists and saproxylic species. Windthrow gaps are dead-wood islands where forest protection and habitat conservation goals may stand against each other. Besides the quantitative effect of dead wood on bark beetle outbreaks and saproxylic diversity, the latter is favoured by key dead-wood micro-habitats such as large logs, snags and sun-exposed coarse woody debris. The role of natural enemies and sanitation operations in regulating pest outbreaks is discussed. Heterogeneous openings provide many micro-habitats favouring flower-visiting insects, phytophages on saplings, on fallen tree crowns, and on diverse understory flora, as well as ground insects on specific micro-sites.

AB  - The lilioid herb, Anthericum ramosum, occurs in four geographically-isolated regions (Sjaelland, Skane, Oland and Gotland) in Denmark and southern Sweden. We investigated allozyme variation at nine polymorphic loci in A. ramosum from 16 sites (33 populations) in the four regions. There was no clear overall geographic pattern of differentiation between the regions, but the southernmost Gotland and the Oland populations had similar allele frequencies, suggesting that they have had a common history. the total genetic diversity (H-tot) wa 0.458 and the between-region, site- and population components of diversity accounted, respectively, for 13%, 10% and 2% of the total diversity. The species is restricted to grassland habitats. Such habitats have become increasingly rare in the Sjaelland and Skane regions, where A. ramosum now has a highly fragmented distribution. Within three of the regions (Sjaelland, Skane and Oland) there was a negative relationship between the extend of grassland habitat and the between-site components of genetic diversity. Oland, with its extensive grassland habitats and low levels of population disjunction, showed little allelic differentiation between sites and the lowest between-site component of diversity (3%), suggesting that there is (or has been) extensive gene flow between sites. The between-site components of diversity were higher within Skane (7%) and Sjaelland (12%). The high within-region G(ST) (25%) for the fourth region, Gotland, cannot be explained in terms of recent habitat disjunction but is, instead, interpreted in terms of the restricted distribution of limestone bedrock on Gotland and the fact that the southern and northern Gotland populations appear to have had different origins.

AB  - This study explores the economic feasibility of several long-rotation afforestation scenarios for southern Ontario, Canada. Three species, red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) and black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) are examined. We integrate growth and yield models, site suitability maps, and several management scenarios to investigate the investment attractiveness of these species inclusive and exclusive of carbon sequestration values. We report net present values (NPV), internal rates of return (IRR) and two break-even price metrics. For wood value only scenarios the IRRs range from 4.3 to 4.6% for red pine and 3.4-3.6% for Norway spruce (for the most attractive 10,000 ha, in a single rotation scenario). Black walnut had rates of return 3.5-3.7% for the most attractive 10,000 ha area. Adding carbon valued at Cdn $3.4 per metric ton CO2-e (roughly 2005 prices in the Chicago Climate Exchange) increases rates of return by about 0.6% for red pine and Norway spruce and 0.4% for black walnut scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly these returns are comparable and better than 20-year rotation hybrid poplar plantations. To achieve a 6% real rate of return break-even carbon prices were $10.7/t CO2-e for red pine, $12.6/t CO2-e for Norway spruce and $17.2/t CO2-e for black walnut (again for the "best" 10,000 ha). Although somewhat unremarkable, the results suggest that these longer-rotation species may be a better investment than perhaps previously expected if landowners have the appropriate site conditions.

AB  - On January 18, 1986 a snow avalanche fell down from the steep slope of Mount Watzmann, Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany, into a mountain mixed forest reaching an elevation of only 610 m asl. The trees were bent to the ground, but they survived, forming a dense canopy pressed to the ground. Although on the landscape scale the avalanche marked a strong visual impact we hypothesized that the species composition of the forest ground layer would not change significantly. To test this we established a set of permanent plots. In the following years new avalanches over and adjacent to the former avalanche track occurred. The established permanent plots allow us to evaluate a second hypothesis, namely that not only structural diversity has been enhanced by the avalanches, but also a sequence of different succession pathways initiated which all together will keep diversity at a high level in the affected area. Our analysis of forest patches which were affected only by the first avalanche shows that, although a strong change in forest structure has taken place, the species composition here remained to a large extent unchanged. This suggests that beneath the dense crown canopy built up by the bent trees the microclimate shows little change, mechanical soil disturbances are rare, and therefore species of open land have no chance to establish. In contrast, if the avalanche uproots and kills the trees a clear change in species composition is the result. On our permanent plots we were able to identify eight different succession pathways initiated by the different disturbance events, causing at various points of time a set of different development phases of the forest ecosystem on the avalanche track.

AB  - Crop choice affects biodiversity within fields due to crop-specific characteristics and management practices. However, there is a lack of studies systematically comparing the biodiversity value of different crops across multiple taxa. This study empirically compared the diversity of plants, pollinators, predatory arthropods, and multi-taxa diversity between seven crop types and long-term environmental fallows in boreal farmland. The effects of crop production method (organic vs. conventional) on biodiversity were also examined. Biodiversity data were collected in 78 fields in Southern Finland. The studied species groups differed in their preferences for crop types and fallows, but none of them was particularly associated to spring cereal (oat), the dominant arable crop in the boreal farmland. Environmental fallows had the highest plant species richness and butterfly abundance, whereas faba bean and oilseed crop fields attracted high numbers of bumblebees. Carabid beetles were most abundant in winter cereal (rye) fields, and spiders in perennial crop types. Multi-taxa diversity was highest in fallows and lowest in spring cereal (oat), ley and cabbage fields. Organic production increased plant species richness across crop types. Hoverflies responded to the interaction of production method and crop type, being most abundant in organically managed faba bean fields. The other species groups and multi-taxa diversity were not affected by the production method. High arable land cover in the surrounding landscape had negative effect on butterflies, solitary bees and carabid beetles within fields. Our results suggest that diversifying cropping systems to include more insect-pollinated crops, winter cereals and pastures, and increasing the area of environmental fallows while maintaining landscape heterogeneity would enhance resource provision for a variety of organism groups in boreal agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Ecological and social fragmentation of hunting grounds presents a challenge to the management of ungulate populations. We studied how the local groups of moose hunters (hunting clubs) have adjusted their hunting practices in the face of competing uses of the land in the Helsinki metropolitan area. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative data from the 11 hunting clubs operating around the Nuuksio National Park. Our theoretical approach was a blend from the social-ecological systems theory and pragmatist conception of habit. According to our findings, there are some key mechanisms of adaptation operative and functioning in this particular social-ecological system. First, we discovered various technical and tactical adaptations in how the actual hunt was exercised in the environment where the perturbations are frequent. We also identified the ways in which the hunters attempted to entrain their activities with the spatial and temporal rhythms of other users. Thirdly, we found out how the hunters also tried to influence the societal rules and the interpretation of existing rules. In the face of continuous fragmentation, the wildlife administration and management would benefit if the collaborative politics of becoming, i. e., prospective will for habit breaking and habit taking in perpetually changing environments, was exercised.

AB  - Outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus kill extensive areas of Norway spruce forests in Central Europe, affecting both protected areas and neighboring commercial forests. In protected areas, uncontrolled (non-intervention) management allows natural beetle-induced tree mortality, while in commercial forests infested trees are salvage-logged in order to lower I. typographus numbers and stabilize wood production. However, the effects of active pest controls on I. typographus population are often ambiguous, and little is known about how antagonists, beetle density, or intraspecific competition help terminate I. typographus outbreaks. To answer this question, we studied I. typographus population development, breeding performance, and natural antagonists under intervention and non-intervention management in the High Tatra Mts. from 2014 to 2017. We used sentinel logs and windthrown trees, following the current legislation in Tatransky narodny park (TANAP, Slovakia) and Tatrzanski Park Narodowy (TPN, Poland). Both parks are mountainous, are covered by Norway spruce forests that have been extensively affected by windthrows and extensive I. typographus outbreaks over the last 20 years, and are zoned under intervention and non-intervention types of management. We found that I. typographus was a dominant species and that its numbers gradually increased during the study, but that the numbers of maternal galleries in sentinel logs (from 50 to 300 per m(2)) and sex ratio (1 male:2.5 females) remained the same among years. The length of maternal galleries and egg production (per m(2) of bark), however, gradually declined, and breeding performance decreased from 10 daughter beetles per female in 2014 to almost zero in 2017. These parameters did not significantly differ between intervention and non-intervention sites. Antagonists were not abundant and had limited effects on I. typographus numbers.
   Active intervention did not affect I. typographus population dynamics or rates of parasitism but increased numbers of Thanasimus beetles, which are predators of bark beetles. In other words, intervention increased the numbers of some natural enemies of I. typographus but did not affect I. typographus population dynamics. Because control measures did not reduce I. typographus numbers in the intervention zone, the natural ecological processes crucial for maintaining ecosystem functioning and biodiversity were evidently preserved.

AB  - In this study, out goal was to test whether typical vent/seep organisms harbouring symbionts or not, would be able to settle on organic substrates deployed in the vicinity of chemosynthetic ecosystems. Since 2006, a series of novel standardized colonization devices (CHEMECOLI CHEMosynthetic Ecosystem COlonization by Larval Invertebrates) filled with three types of substrates (wood, alfalfa and carbonate) have been deployed in different types of reducing habitats including cold seeps in the eastern Mediterranean, a mud volcano in the Norwegian Sea, and hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge for durations of 2 weeks to 1 year. For all deployments, highest species diversities were recovered from CHEMECOLIs filled with organic substrates. Larvae from species associated with thiotrophic symbionts such as thyasirid, vesicomyid and mytilid bivalves, were recovered in the eastern Mediterranean and at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge At the Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, larvae of symbiotic siboglinids settled on both organic and carbonate substrates Overall, novel colonization devices (CHEMECOLI) filled with organic substrates attracted both fauna relying on chemosynthesis-derived carbon as well as fauna relying on heterotrophy the latter being opportunistic and tolerant to sulphide.

AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa's total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

AB  - Forests can help mitigate climate change in different ways, such as by storing carbon in forest ecosystems, and by producing a renewable supply of material and energy products. We analyse the climate implications of different scenarios for forestry, bioenergy and wood construction. We consider three main forestry scenarios for Kronoberg County in Sweden, over a 201-year period. The Business-as-usual scenario mirrors today's forestry while in the Production scenario the forest productivity is increased by 40% through more intensive forestry. In the Set-aside scenario 50% of forest land is set-aside for conservation. The Production scenario results in less net carbon dioxide emissions and cumulative radiative forcing compared to the other scenarios, after an initial period of 30-35 years during which the Set-aside scenario has less emissions. In the end of the analysed period, the Production scenario yields strong emission reductions, about ten times greater than the initial reduction in the Set-aside scenario. Also, the Set-aside scenario has higher emissions than Business-as-usual after about 80 years. Increasing the harvest level of slash and stumps results in climate benefits, due to replacement of more fossil fuel. Greatest emission reduction is achieved when biomass replaces coal, and when modular timber buildings are used. In the long run, active forestry with high harvest and efficient utilisation of biomass for replacement of carbon-intensive non-wood products and fuels provides significant climate mitigation, in contrast to setting aside forest land to store more carbon in the forest and reduce the harvest of biomass.

KW  - Finland
AB  - Decision making and regulatory policies on contaminated land management (CLM) are commonly governed by risk assessment. Risk assessment, thus, has to comply with legislation, but also provide valid information in terms of actual risks to correctly focus the potentially required measures and allocate the available resources. Hence, reliable risk assessment is a prerequisite for justified and sustainable risk management. This paper gives an introduction to the Finnish risk-based regulatory framework, outlines the challenges within the policies and the practice and provides an overview of the new guidance document to promote risk-based and sustainable CLM. We argue that the current risk assessment approaches in the policy frameworks are not necessarily efficient enough in supporting justified risk-based decisions. One of the main reasons for this is the excessive emphasis put on conservative risk assessments and on generic guideline values without contributing to their appropriate application. This paper presents how some of the challenges in risk-based decision making have been tackled in the Finnish regulatory framework on contaminated land. We believe that our study will also stimulate interest with regard to policy frameworks in other countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important substrate in forests, provides habitat for a multitude of organisms and is also a sink and a source for nutrients and carbon. To assess the dynamics of this substrate equations to describe the course of decomposition have been developed. They can also be used to describe the release of carbon from dead wood into the atmosphere. Unfortunately few equations have been parameterised for European conditions, although there is a need to estimate the dynamics of CWD in this region. Therefore, a method (termed the LB-method) was invented to estimate suitable decomposition rate constants (DRC) from sources published in the CWD Global Database by systematically comparing features and conditions of the area and species of interest with the information given with the published equations. The DRC were weighed according to these comparisons and then sorted by the weight assigned to them. From the resulting distribution a plausible DRC for the region and species of interest was estimated. The LB-method was compared to results from a study on Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) decomposition in Thuringia, Germany, and to results from an expert elicitation on DRC for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany. In both cases the method gave results within the confidence interval of the respective study used for comparison. Both methods are suitable for the estimation of preliminary DRC until more accurate constants can be derived by research. While the focus in this study was on density loss the method can be applied to other dead wood features (e.g. volume), and should be applicable to other regions of the world where information is also scarce.

AB  - [ 1] We used a simple hydrological-biogeochemical mixing model to test the hypothesis that export of total organic carbon occurring mainly during spring in taiga and tundra watersheds might be compensated by production and export of bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) from groundwater during the rest of the year. The investigated watersheds are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle. An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river systems. During this snowmelt, total organic carbon (TOC), previously stored as soil carbon, is flushed and exported from the watersheds, and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea, thereby contributing to atmospheric CO(2). The TOC yields of the watersheds investigated increased with vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watersheds from 0.5 to 2.8 tons km(-2) yr(-1). During frozen periods, streamflow is dominated by "old'' groundwater. This water has percolated through the soils and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate; that is, atmospheric carbon that has been "consumed'' in chemical weathering processes is partly exported as bicarbonate to the sea, where carbon is stored as CaCO(3) for geological time. The bicarbonate export of the watersheds investigated was between 0.4 and 1.2 tons C km(-2) yr(-1) corresponding to 15 - 73% of the TOC export. Very likely, global warming will affect water flow through the soils in taiga and tundra ecosystems and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budgets. This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amounts of the exported TOC, thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO(2).

AB  - Submarine tailing disposal (STD) in fjords from land-based mines is common practice in Norway and takes place in other regions worldwide. We synthesize the results of a multidisciplinary programme on environmental impacts of STDs in Norwegian fjords, providing new knowledge that can be applied to assess and mitigate impact of tailing disposal globally, both for submarine and deep-sea activities. Detailed geological seafloor mapping provided data on natural sedimentation to monitor depositional processes on the seafloor. Modelling and analytical techniques were used to assess the behaviour of tailing particles and process-chemicals in the environment, providing novel tools for monitoring. Toxicity tests showed biological impacts on test species due to particulate and chemical exposure. Hypersedimentation mesocosm and field experiments showed a varying response on the benthos, allowing to determine the transition zone in the STD impact area. Recolonisation studies indicate that full community recovery and normalisation of metal leakage rates may take several decades due to bioturbation and slow burial of sulfidic tailings. The results are synthesised to provide guidelines for the development of best available techniques for STDs.

AB  - Carex digitata and Melica nutans are forest understorey herbs with wide European distributions and their northern range margins in Fennoscandia. The species have closely similar habitat requirements, occur in small populations in old forest stands on base-rich to neutral soils and have restricted dispersal abilities at the present day. This study investigates the structure of allozyme variation (12 and 8 loci, respectively) in material of both species (38 and 37 populations, respectively) from throughout southern Sweden and southern Finland. Both species show a relatively low overall genetic diversity (HT excluding monomorphic loci = 0.17 and 0.18, respectively). The hierarchic structuring of allelic diversity in the species is similar, with a relatively high between-population component of diversity (G(ST) = 0.36 and 0.37. respectively). Neither of the species shows a clear intraspecific pattern of geographic differentiation. The lack of large-scale patterns of geographic differentiation is not consistent with a simple scenario of discrete and independent waves of immigration into Fermoscandia. However, particularly in M. nutans, a group of populations from a lowland belt across southwestern Finland and southern central Sweden is somewhat differentiated from populations to the north and south. A number of rare alleles in both species are widely, but patchily distributed in low frequencies. Hybridization may account for the scattered occurence of some of the rare alleles in Carex digitata, but cannot explain the distribution of rare alleles in Melica nutans.

AB  - In Norway there is an official system (ANISTAT) for reporting notifiable diseases to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, which is mainly done by veterinarians and laboratories. Another separate official system (HAVBRUKSDATA) is also in place, for reporting production data from fish farms, such as the number of fish put into the sea, and their weight, density, feed consumption and mortality. The reported data are aggregated monthly with information from companies' private databases related to each production site and each production unit. There also are official procedures in place for the registration of drugs used in aquaculture, based on veterinary prescriptions. However there is no electronic system for active reporting diseases influencing production and/or welfare.
   It is our aim to establish a more advanced official system for monitoring the health situation in Norwegian fish farms (MFISK) by linking relevant production data from the various private databases to an official disease database. The output of the new system will be improved statistics on diseases in the Norwegian fish farming industry, with diseases sorted by their impact on production and welfare. This will enable us to identify diseases that, overtime, cause such losses that they should be dealt with by the authorities, or by the farmers themselves. It will also have an early warning function regarding new/emerging diseases or disease trends. This system quantifies losses due to health problems and, in the long run, will be a useful tool for strengthening fish health.
   The system aims to combine data from various sources: the veterinary and fisheries authorities in Norway, farmers, veterinarians and laboratories. To be sustainable, it will need the active and constructive cooperation of all these stakeholders.

AB  - The gradients of soil physicochemical properties along mountain slopes and across climate-elevation gradients were studied in the Karkonosze Mountains, focusing on the human-impacted zonality of the vegetation cover. The main focus of the study was the environmental consequences, both human-induced and spontaneous, of vegetation changes in the mountains which may occur due to climate change. In soils developed from granite, a clear altitude-related differentiation of soil properties was manifested by: (i) an increase in total organic carbon (TOC) with elevation; (ii) an increase in exchangeable acidity and aluminum (Al-ex); (iii) a decrease in pH, (iv) a decrease in base saturation; and (v) finer soil texture and higher content of base cations in the foothills and lower slopes. These altitude-dependent trends have a threshold-type distribution, i.e. the values stabilize at 7501000 m a.s.l. or are reversed in the subalpine zone. Grass vegetation decreased TOC and Alex, but increased soil pH and base saturation compared with forest vegetation at the same altitude zone. Soils under spruce had higher TOC but lower pH compared with beech stands.
   Present-day changes of mountain area management in Central Europe, i.e. the replacement of spruce monocultures with beech or mixed stands in the lower forest zone and reforestation (mainly with spruce or mountain pine) of abandoned meadows and pastures at and above the timberline significantly influence topsoil properties, but there is a contrasting direction of changes in the lower and upper altitude zones. Expected climate changes may shift the upper limits of the individual forest zones and reinforce the ongoing changes in forest management. The final regional result of changes is difficult to calculate and strongly dependent on the degree of anthropogenic transformation of vegetation cover. However, both the current changes in management practices and possible climate changes will reinforce the existing vertical gradients of mountain soil properties, including the elevation-related increase in TOC, exchangeable acidity and Alex, as well as the decrease in soil pH and base saturation.

AB  - Non-native tree species are widely used in forest plantations. This may have negative consequences for biodiversity. Hitherto, most studies have compared species diversity between native and non-native forest stands, which makes it difficult to separate the impact of tree species per se from stand characteristics. Our study, conducted in the south of Sweden, compares saproxylic beetle diversity across different nutritional groups, in dead wood of two native and four non-native tree species in a block design after one and three seasons. Such an approach allows analysis of the impact of non-native tree species per se. Mean species richness (+/- SD) per log was lower in non-native than in native tree species (non-native trees: lodgepole pine: 10.7 (+/- 5.3); Sitka spruce: 8.5 (+/- 4.3), Douglas fir: 7.1 (+/- 4.3), Japanese larch 9.4 (+/- 4.6); native trees: Norway spruce: 12.0 (+/- 6.0), Scots pine: 12.3 (+/- 5.2)). Sample-based rarefaction revealed that when only native tree species were pooled, the species richness was higher than for all tree species combined. The difference in species composition among tree species was strongly driven by bark and wood consumers in the first season, while for predators and fungivores, the differences were smaller. Species composition differed most in the first season. Dissimilarity in beetle species composition was positively correlated with phylogenetic distances of the tree species. Species richness was lower in non-native tree species that are only remotely related to native trees species. Of the studied non-native tree species, lodgepole pine was more closely related to native tree species and consistently harboured higher species richness. Synthesis and applications. Although non-native tree species also harbour saproxylic beetle communities, the use of non-native tree species, especially those only remotely related to native tree species, reduces local diversity of saproxylic beetles. Thus, for biodiversity conservation, an extensive use of non-native tree species is not recommended as this increases the risk of losing forest biodiversity, especially when they are only distantly related to native tree species.

AB  - The study of ecological perturbation gradients provides a unique opportunity to investigate the utility of various biocomplexity indices. The ability of four measures of biocomplexity (quadratic entropy, taxonomic entropy, total complexity and total diversity) and their components to quantify the nature and degree of perturbation in plant communities was assessed by how closely each measure reflected the trends in biocomplexity that are expected to occur along a gradient of decreasing perturbation. The measures were applied to two landscapes, located near Sudbury, Canada and Harjavalta, Finland, perturbed by nickel-copper smelter emissions. Taxonomic entropy was determined to be the most useful of the four measures as it has a clear information-theoretical meaning, the relative contributions of classical diversity and taxonomic information can be easily isolated, and its computation is straightforward relative to the other measures. Additionally, it is relatively insensitive to community evenness, thereby rendering it less sample-size dependant and a more appropriate measure to use for comparisons between studies as well as for conservation and restoration purposes.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture has been identified as key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to end poverty and hunger and address climate change while maintaining natural resources. Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is a key soil function for ecosystem services, and storing carbon (C) in soil by changing traditional management practices can represent an important step toward the development of more sustainable agricultural systems in Europe. Within the European project Diverfarming, the process-based ecosystem model ECOSSE was modified and evaluated in four long-term experiments (>8 years) to assess the impact of crop diversification and agricultural management in SOC dynamics. ECOSSE was able to simulate SOC under dry conditions in Mediterranean regions in Spain and Italy. In the site of Murcia, Spain, the addition of manure and cover crop in the diversified systems produced an increase of SOC in 9 years, when compared with the conventional management (16% measured increase, 32% simulated increase). The effect of tillage management on SOC stock in dry soil, in Foggia, Italy and Huesca, Spain, was also modeled, and a positive impact on SOC was predicted when no tillage was practiced. Finally, ECOSSE was used to understand the impact of diversifications in Boreal regions, Finland, where different proportions of legumes and grass were considered in a 4-year crop rotation compared with conventional cereal rotations. Experiments and modeling showed that the loss of SOC in conventional cereal was compensated when grass was introduced in the rotations. A good agreement (NRMSE <10%) and a nonsignificant bias were observed between model and experimental data for all sites. Mitigation scenarios considered in the modeling analysis for the test site Huesca showed that an integrated management of no tillage and manure is the best strategy to increase SOC, similar to 51% over 20 years, compared with the baseline scenario (current farmers practice). This study demonstrated the ability of the modified version of ECOSSE to simulate SOC dynamics in diversified cropping systems, with various soil management practices and different climatic conditions.

AB  - Stocking is a widely applied practice for enhancement of fish populations exploited for recreational and commercial uses. In the present study, we investigate the genetic consequences of stocking and river diversion by analyzing 18 microsatellites in 440 brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from three historical and ten contemporary populations from two river systems in a national park in Norway. Eight sources have been recorded for stocking in this area, but not concurrently. These stocking events took place after historical sampling and river diversion by construction of a barrier and a channel. A complete shift in the genetic structure between historical and contemporary populations was revealed. The genetic differentiation can be explained by stocking with just four non-native sources. The constructed barrier has helped to maintain a fraction of the historical genetic profile. Stocking success is discussed in relation to population exploitation, variation in natural recruitment, and reduced discharge due to river diversion. Our study demonstrates a high vulnerability of natural populations to stocking with non-native fish, of particular importance for fishery management and preservation of native fish.

AB  - Because the family Chironomidae, or non-biting midges, is one of the most species-rich groups of macro-invertebrates in freshwater habitats, species-level identifications of chironomids are important for biodiversity assessments in these ecosystems. Morphology-based species identifications from adult female chironomids usually are considerably more difficult than from adult males, or even impossible; thus, the females are often neglected in community assessments. We used DNA barcoding to investigate how inclusion of the females influenced the species count from springs and spring brooks at Solendet Nature Reserve in Central Norway. By means of the barcodes we were able to identify 77.6% of the females to species by associating them with males from the study site or from other regions, whereas the remaining, unassociated females could be identified to genus level only. The number of recorded species increased by 27% when females were included. We also found that DNA barcoding is effective for the detection of taxonomically challenging species and species groups. Using DNA barcoding in combination with traditional taxonomy, we recognised at least five species new to science and three species and one genus new to Norway.

AB  - In Central European mountain forests, timber production and the protection of infrastructure and settlements against gravitational natural hazards are key forest ecosystem services (ES). The quantitative assessment of mountain forest ES for management planning and decision support is a particular challenge, due to manifold involved spatial scales from tree to slope and landscape level. We present an assessment framework to analyze and communicate the effect of management and climate change on the provision of selected ES in mountain forests. Core element is the spatially explicit hybrid forest ecosystem model PICUS. Remote sensing data and inventories are combined to generate realistic fine-grained forest landscapes with single tree resolution as input to PICUS. Landscape-level planning of silvicultural prescriptions employs geographic information systems functionalities (locate skyline corridors and treatment areas, prescribe silvicultural operations based on tree-level attributes) and produces management maps, which are interpreted by PICUS and executed in course of simulation runs. Model output is imported into a spatially explicit landscape assessment tool to assess the protective effect of vegetation. In a 250 ha case study in the Eastern Alps in Austria, the assessment framework is demonstrated to evaluate effects of climate change and management on timber production and protection against landslides and snow avalanche release. Climate change had, depending on climate and management scenario both, positive and negative impacts on desired ES. Key factor for ES provisioning in the case study was the interaction of bark beetle disturbances, legacies of past land-use practices and forest management.

AB  - Stump harvesting as a way to increase wood biomass production in order to meet the European Union targets for reduced CO2 emissions is starting up in Sweden. The knowledge about if and how Collembola species can use low stumps as a substrate is very limited. Stumps of three different ages (4, 14 and 75 years) were sampled to see if Collembola used the dead wood during the whole rotation period of a forest. Stumps of spruce, pine and birch were compared. Both the bark and the splint wood of the stumps were sampled. To determine whether the stump also influenced the nearby soil, the soil close to the stump were sampled as well as the soil further away. In total, five Collembola species that are known to prefer dead wood as a substrate were found in the stumps. Wood specialists were more dominating in young stumps, but occurred also in the oldest stumps. No preference was found for any specific tree species. Wood-living Collembola seem to be able to survive in low stumps for a whole rotation period, at least in low numbers. There is, however, a risk for extinction debt due to their low capacity for active long-distance dispersal.

AB  - In order to effectively identify and protect the most valuable forest areas for conservation, it is essential to understand species diversity patterns and the co-variation of different taxonomic groups. In this study we analysed the extent to which lichens, bryophytes and saproxylic beetles co-vary, their ability to represent each other in a reserve network (surrogate capacity), and their patterns of beta-diversity. We also tested the surrogate capacity of dead wood. A species and dead wood inventory was conducted in forest sites in a boreal forest region in central Sweden. Overall, the correlations in species richness between taxa were weak, but some were statistically significant, i.e. those between red-listed lichens and red-listed bryophytes. Beetles were weakly positively correlated with bryophytes, but never with lichens. None of the tested taxa provided a reliable surrogate for representing the other taxa. However, dead wood diversity did represent saproxylic beetles and bryophytes better than random selection and might therefore function as a conservation surrogate for those taxa. Beta-diversity differed significantly between the taxa; lichens had the lowest, while beetles had the highest. Altogether beetles showed low association with the other taxa but high beta-diversity, which implies that they may require specific conservation planning.

AB  - Nordic water bodies face multiple stressors due to human activities, generating diffuse loading and climate change. The 'green shift' towards a bio-based economy poses new demands and increased pressure on the environment. Bioeconomy-related pressures consist primarily of more intensive land management to maximise production of biomass. These activities can add considerable nutrient and sediment loads to receiving waters, posing a threat to ecosystem services and good ecological status of surface waters. The potential threats of climate change and the 'green shift' highlight the need for improved understanding of catchment-scale water and element fluxes. Here, we assess possible bioeconomy-induced pressures on Nordic catchments and associated impacts on water quality. We suggest measures to protect water quality under the 'green shift' and propose 'road maps' towards sustainable catchment management. We also identify knowledge gaps and highlight the importance of long-term monitoring data and good models to evaluate changes in water quality, improve understanding of bioeconomy-related impacts, support mitigation measures and maintain ecosystem services.

AB  - Mountain spruce forests in Central Europe decline under storms and bark beetle calamities driven by climate change. A stabilisation by planting rare or missing tree species is expensive and requires funding. A funding policy should mitigate climate change and support biodiversity. The goal of this study was to identify a conversion strategy of even-aged spruce-dominated forest stands to uneven-aged mixed stands with spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and fir (Abies alba Mill.). A simultaneous nonlinear optimisation of the number of planted trees and harvested trees per species and per period schedules stand treatments aiming to maximise the long-term financial outcome. Planting modelling extends a density-dependent stand-level matrix transition model based on diameter classes with an age-class-based model for artificial regeneration. An optimal conversion strategy was applied for five funding policy schemes, each for five initial states representing different stages of age and species composition typical for spruce forest conversion in the mountain zone of the Western Carpathians. Only 50% and higher funding of planting costs for the minor/missing fir and beech species facilitates a substantial increase of their shares in stand volume. Funding decreases the volume failure due to mortality. Funding increases the standing and harvested volume, which mitigates climate change by increasing the carbon sequestration. Funding causes unintended effects on ecosystem services by lowering harvest diameters, decreasing the volume of less profitable beech, and temporarily reducing the stand density aimed at supporting plantings and their diameter increments.

AB  - Forests play an important role in one of the most important ecosystem services, climate regulation. In order to mitigate climate change, various international agreements aim at decreasing emissions through Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) activities. In a legislative proposal by the European Union, emissions from forests are accounted for in relation to an estimate of average emissions for a range of years in the past. However, different forest structures, management activities, growth variations and impacts of changing climate may result in considerably different future emissions. We assessed the magnitude of potential uncertainties due to changing climate and forest management to the projections of carbon stocked in above- and belowground forest biomass in Finland until 2050. We used an area-based matrix model, which was developed to incorporate climate-induced tree growth as a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. The potential amounts of both the carbon stored and extracted varied considerably depending on the level and allocation of future harvests. If realized, climate- or management-induced growth improvements could increase the carbon stocks by up to one third in the end of the simulated period. Projections based solely on business-as-usual transitions and harvests could therefore lead to inefficient decisions regarding future carbon stocks and harvesting possibilities. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Sown wildflower strips should promote the species diversity of several insect groups in order to be an effective tool for the compensation of biodiversity loss in agricultural environments. We studied the responses of two herbivorous insect groups, Heteroptera (true bugs) and Auchenorrhyncha (leaf-hoppers), to the properties of wildflower strips in a three-year (2008-2010) study in southern Finland. The experiment was replicated in six reed canary grass fields. The insect groups showed opposite responses; the abundance of Auchenorrhyncha was lower while the abundance and species richness of Heteroptera was higher in wildflower than control strips. During succession, both species richness and abundance of Auchenorrhyncha increased unlike Heteroptera. This difference could largely be explained by dietary differences. Auchenorrhyncha, including several grass feeders, could not take advantage of the increasing dicot species richness like Heteroptera species. This was also a likely reason for the unexpected finding that only Heteroptera species richness depended on the placement of the strip, being higher near field margins than in mid-field. We conclude that the optimal planning and implementation of wildflower strips call for the definition of clear goals, the knowledge of the requirements of target species as well as considering the cropping system involved.

AB  - The occurrence of fires was studied in the eastern Saariselkd area, North-West Russia, by using satellite images and topographical maps. In total, more than 330 burned areas were pinpointed in the study area of 4770 km(2). Old burns were concentrated in the eastern part of the study area, but young burns were more common in the west. Sites affected by fires in the more recent past were much smaller than those burnt over earlier. The abundance of burns along rivers and the border surveillance road provided evidence of human impact. The most significant changes in the landscape were found in the eastern part of the study area, where spruce forests had been replaced by birch woodlands.

AB  - Incentive based voluntary conservation programs have gained prominence as a regulation mechanism to protect ecosystem services on private land either through the set-aside of land for reserves or by altering land management practices. A crucial challenge for voluntary approaches is however to ensure private landowner involvement and get the ecosystem services delivered where they are most demanded by society. To promote participation and ensure an instrumental design of voluntary initiatives that is coherent with this, there is a need to understand the motivations of the landowners and determinants of their participation choice. We investigate landowners' willingness to participate in protecting oak scrub sites in Denmark. Combining contract data of the landowners' actual choices, GIS information on area specific characteristics and detailed individual level register data, we develop and implement a framework for analysing revealed choice of private landowners' in voluntary conservation programs. We find that both the physical characteristics of the property and the sociodemographic characteristics of landowner in question matter, along with the information flow provided from the regulator. Results provide impetus into the design of future conservation policies, in terms of how, to whom and where to target efforts.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been vital for meeting global food demand but has caused environmental degradation. This has disrupted the ability of soil to provide vital ecosystem services. Organic farming is often thought to conserve and utilise soil ecosystem services, and thus be a more sustainable method of food production than conventional farming. However, evidence for this is equivocal, and little is known of the potential trade-offs between soil functions, which can be classified as supporting and provisioning ecosystem services, in conventional and organic systems. In addition, few studies have simultaneously examined how surrounding landscape heterogeneity affects soil functions in agriculture. In this study we investigated the effects of farming method (conventional versus organic) and landscape heterogeneity (100 m, 500 m and 1000 m radius) on indicators of soil ecosystem services: soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water holding capacity (WHC) and plant-available phosphorous (P) (measures of carbon storage and nutrient retention); net N mineralisation and microbial community composition and biomass (nutrient cycling); and crop yield. We found no effect of landscape heterogeneity, and no differences in any of the measured soil and microbial variables between conventional and organic farms, apart from net N mineralisation, which was higher in organic farms. However, conventional farms had significantly greater yield than organic farms, and there was no apparent trade-off between increasing yield and the level of supporting ecosystem services. The organic farms in this study appear to have been intensively managed, with a straight substitution of organic inputs for chemicals, but little other effort to enhance soil fertility. For example, the organic farms applied large quantities of manure compared with conventional farms but conducted mechanical weeding (harrowing), whereas conventional farms applied herbicides. This repeated soil disturbance may cause rapid organic matter mineralisation and undermine the ability of these organic farms to retain carbon and nitrogen. The terms 'organic' and 'conventional' agriculture both cover a wide variety of farming methods, some of which enhance or deplete ecosystem services more than others. To develop truly sustainable methods of agriculture, research should focus on the effects of specific farming practices, rather than the labels 'conventional' and 'organic'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Norway, 29 fjords and 52 rivers have been designated for protection in order to prevent the infection of important populations of wild salmonids with salmon lice of farm origin. We evaluated the effect of this protection on the lice infection pressure for wild salmonids based on lice counts performed on wild-caught sea trout and Arctic charr inside one-third of these protected fjords (known as 'National Salmon Fjords'). Results indicate that these areas may provide a certain extent of protection against lice of farm origin, but their configuration will play a key role in their success. When the size and shape of a protected area are such that fish farms are kept at a minimum distance (calculated here as at least 30 km, but this distance is likely site-dependent), wild fish seem unaffected by the direct lice infection pressure imposed by fish farms. In contrast, the effects of small protected fjords were strongly dependent on the production pattern of the aquaculture industry in the surrounding area, and we found a clear correlation between lice levels on wild salmonids and lice production in nearby salmon farms. To establish more precise management practices, both in National Salmon Fjords and other fjord systems along the Norwegian coast, the development and validation of accurate distribution and abundance models for the dispersion of planktonic lice larvae is needed; this could also be the basis for an area management system based on 'maximum sustainable lice loads' or 'lice quotas.'

AB  - Background: Forests and forest products can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation by stabilizing and even potentially decreasing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Harvested wood products (HWP) represent a common widespread and cost-efficient opportunity for negative emissions. After harvest, a significant fraction of the wood remains stored in HWPs for a period that can vary from some months to many decades, whereas atmospheric carbon (C) is immediately sequestered by vegetation re-growth. This temporal mismatch between oxidation of HWPs and C uptake by vegetation generates a net sink that lasts over time. The role of temporary carbon storage in forest products has been analysed and debated in the scientific literature, but detailed bottomup studies mapping the fate of harvested materials and quantifying the associated emission profiles at national scales are rare. In this work, we quantify the net CO2 emissions and the temporary carbon storage in forest products in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the period 1960-2015, and investigate their correlation. We use a Chi square probability distribution to model the oxidation rate of C over time in HWPs, taking into consideration specific half-lives of each category of products. We model the forest regrowth and estimate the time-distributed C removal. We also integrate the specific HWP flows with an emission inventory database to quantify the associated life-cycle emissions of fossil CO2, CH4 and N2O.
   Results: We find that assuming an instantaneous oxidation of HWPs would overestimate emissions of about 1.18 billion t CO2 (cumulative values for the three countries over the period 1960-2015).We also find that about 40 years after 1960, the starting year of our analysis, are sufficient to detect signs of negative emissions. The total amount of net CO2 emissions achieved in 2015 are about -3.8 million t CO2, -27.9 t CO2 and -43.6 t CO2 in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, respectively.
   Conclusion: We argue for a more explicit accounting of the actual emission rates from HWPs in carbon balance studies and climate impact analysis of forestry systems and products, and a more transparent inclusion of the potential of HWP as negative emissions in perspective studies and scenarios. Simply assuming that all harvested carbon is instantaneously oxidized can lead to large biases and ultimately overlook the benefits of negative emissions of HWPs.

AB  - Norway, a significant petroleum producer and exporter, has been a frontrunner within policies for carbon capture and storage (CCS). As CCS is recognized as a key technology for achieving the Paris climate policy targets, there is a clear need for more knowledge about how to design successful projects. Norway's first CCS policy initiative, the ambitious Mongstad project, was the result of a political compromise that was imposed from above, basically with one single company in control. The project was largely seen as a failure and was terminated in 2013. However, instead of dropping ambitions for developing CCS projects, the authorities launched a new policy soon afterwards. This policy evolved with the differently organized Longship CCS project as its core. Using a path-dependency perspective, we find that established institutional structures from the Mongstad project, combined with national interests and expertise, help to explain the fundamental continuity of CCS policies in Norway. This explanation is supplemented by a policy-learning perspective, which helps to explain policy changes and differences between the two flagship CCS projects. The Longship project developed gradually 'from below'; linked project responsibilities close to competences and interests; dealt with key risks separately to reduce the inherent complexity; and organized clear requirements up front. We hold that this way of designing CCS projects is of relevance to other countries considering CCS projects. Furthermore, by placing the Norwegian case in context of the development of EU and international climate policy we contribute a theoretical framework relevant also for subsequent research.

AB  - A large share, estimated at 12-25%, of the annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to global deforestation. Increasing the forested areas therefore has a positive impact on carbon (C) sequestration and mitigation of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Fast-growing species, such as willow and poplar, are of high interest as producers of biomass for fuel, but also as C sinks. The present study estimated the rate of C sequestration in biomass and soil in willow and poplar plantations. Calculations were based on above- and below-ground biomass production data from field experiments, including fine root turnover, litter decomposition rates, and production levels from commercial plantations. Accumulation of C in woody biomass, above and below ground, was estimated at 76.6-80.1 Mg C ha(-1) and accumulation of C in the soil at 9.0-10.3 Mg C ha(-1) over the first 20-22 years. The average rates of C sequestration were 3.5-4.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in woody biomass, and 0.4-0.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the soil. If 400,000 ha of abandoned arable land in Sweden were planted with willow and poplar, about 1.5 Tg C would be sequestered annually in woody biomass and 0.2 Tg C in soils. This would be nearly one tenth of the annual anthropogenic emissions of C in Sweden today. These calculations show the potential of fast-growing plantations on arable land to mitigate the effect of high CO2 concentrations over a short time span. Knowledge gaps were found during the calculation process and future research areas were suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riparian zones are hotspots of plant species richness in temperate and boreal biomes. The phenomenon is believed to be caused primarily by river-related processes, and upland influences on riparian zones have received relatively little attention. We investigated the importance of discharge of groundwater derived from uplands on riparian patterns in vascular plant species composition. We found that groundwater discharge areas in riparian zones were 36-209% more species rich than non-discharge areas, depending on spatial scale ( 1-50 m wide transects from annual high-water levels to summer low-water levels) and river ( one free-flowing and one regulated). Higher nitrogen availability and less drought stress during low river stages are suggested as the major causes for the higher species diversity in discharge areas. Riparian zones lacking groundwater discharge lost more species following water-level regulation than did discharge areas. This indicates that groundwater discharge areas are more resistant to regulation because both individual plants and plant populations may grow larger in discharge areas. These results demonstrate that riparian zones are controlled by water and nutrient input from upland parts of catchments in ways that have been overlooked despite more than three decades of research into linkages between stream ecosystems and their valleys.

AB  - The marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium Halim represents perhaps the most significant and intensively studied genus with respect to species diversity, life history strategies, toxigenicity, biogeographical distribution, and global magnitude and consequences harmful algal blooms (HABs). The socioeconomic impacts, environmental and human health risks, and mitigation strategies for toxigenic Alexandrium blooms have also been explored in recent years. Human adaptive actions based on future scenarios of bloom dynamics and shifts in biogeographical distribution under climate-change parameters remain under development and not yet implemented on a regional scale. In the CoCliME (Co-development of climate services for adaptation to changing marine ecosystems) project these issues were addressed with respect to past, current and anticipated future status of key HAB genera and expected benefits of enhanced monitoring. Data on the distribution and frequency of Alexandrium blooms related to paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events from key CoCliME Case Study areas, comprising the North Sea and adjacent Kattegat-Skagerrak, Norwegian Sea, and Baltic Sea, and eastern North Atlantic marginal seas, were evaluated in a contemporary and historical context over the past several decades. The first evidence of possible biogeographical expansion of Alexandrium taxa into eastern Arctic gateways was provided from DNA barcoding signatures. Various key climate change indicators, such as salinity, temperature, and water-column stratification, relevant to Alexandrium bloom initiation and development were identified. The possible influence of changing variables on bloom dynamics, magnitude, frequency and spatial and temporal distribution were interpreted in the context of regional ocean climate models. These climate change impact indicators may play key roles in selecting for the occurrence and diversity of Alexandrium species within the broader microeukaryote communities. For example, shifts to higher temperature and lower salinity regimes predicted for the southern North Sea indicate the potential for increased Alexandrium blooms, currently absent from this area. Ecological and socioeconomic impacts of Alexandrium blooms and effects on fisheries and aquaculture resources and coastal ecosystem function are evaluated, and, where feasible, effective adaptation strategies are proposed herein as emerging climate services.

AB  - Sustainable forest management and harvested wood products together can create a growing carbon sink by storing carbon in long-lived products. The role of wood products in climate change mitigation has been studied from several perspectives, but not yet from a consumer's view. In this study, we examine the impact of wooden housing on consumer carbon footprints in Finland. We use the 2016 Finnish Household Budget Survey and Exiobase 2015, a global multi-regional input-output model. The sample size is 3700 households, of which 45% live in a wooden house. We find that residents of wooden houses have a 12(+/- 3)% (950 kg CO2-eq/year) lower carbon footprint on average than residents of non-wooden houses, when income, household type, education of the main income provider, age of the house, owner-occupancy and urban zone are controlled in regression analysis. This is not fully explained by the impact of the construction material, which suggests that the residents of wooden houses may have some features in their lifestyles that lower their carbon footprints further. In addition, we find that an investment in a new wooden house in an urban area has a strong reducing impact on a consumer's carbon footprint, while investments in other types of housing have a weaker or no reducing impact. Our findings support wooden housing as a meaningful sustainable consumption choice.

AB  - We present regionally aggregated emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from five land cover categories in Finland: artificial surfaces, arable land, forest, waterbodies, and wetlands. Carbon (C) sequestration to managed forests and unmanaged wetlands was also assessed. Models FRES and ALas were applied for emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) from artificial surfaces and agriculture, and PREBAS for forest growth and C balance. Empirical emission coefficients were used to estimate emissions from drained forested peatland (CH4, N2O), cropland (CO2), waterbodies (CH4, CO2), peat production sites and undrained mires (CH4, CO2, N2O). We calculated gross emissions of 147.2 & PLUSMN; 6.8 TgCO2eq yr-1 for 18 administrative units covering mainland Finland, using data representative of the period 2017-2025. Emissions from energy production, industrial processes, road traffic and other sources in artificial surfaces amounted to 45.7 & PLUSMN; 2.0 TgCO2eq yr-1. The loss of C in forest harvesting was the largest emission source in the LULUCF sector, in total 59.8 & PLUSMN; 3.3 TgCO2eq yr-1. Emissions from domestic livestock production, field cultivation and organic soils added up to 12.2 & PLUSMN; 3.5 TgCO2eq yr-1 from arable land. Rivers and lakes (13.4 & PLUSMN; 1.9 TgCO2eq yr-1) as well as undrained mires and peat production sites (14.7 & PLUSMN; 1.8 TgCO2eq yr-1) increased the total GHG fluxes. The C sequestration from the atmosphere was 93.2 & PLUSMN; 13.7 TgCO2eq yr-1. with the main sink in forest on mineral soil (79.9 & PLUSMN; 12.2 TgCO2eq yr-1). All sinks compensated 63% of total emissions and thus the net emissions were 53.9 & PLUSMN; 15.3 TgCO2eq yr-1, or a net GHG flux per capita of 9.8 MgCO2eq yr-1.

AB  - As a consequence of colonisation from different glacial refugia, many northern European taxa are split into distinct western and eastern lineages. However, as for the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), the exact location of the contact zone between lineages often remains poorly known. We assessed the genetic differentiation and diversity in the nine-spined stickleback within Europe using 1037 base pairs of cytochrome b sequence for 320 individuals from 57 locations, including pond, lake, river, and coastal habitats. Our main aims were (i) to locate the contact zone between the previously recognized western and eastern lineages, (ii) investigate latitudinal patterns in genetic diversity, (iii) compare genetic diversity among different habitat types, and (iv) date the known split between eastern and western lineages. The data revealed the split between eastern and western to be located across the Danish Straits and roughly following the Norway/Sweden border to the North. Reference sites from Canada form their own clades, and one of the Canadian sites was found to have a haplotype common to the Eastern European lineage, possibly representing an ancestral polymorphism. The split between the two European clades was dated to approximately 1.48 million years ago (Mya), and between Canada and Europe to approximately 1.62 Mya. After controlling for habitat effects, nucleotide (but not haplotype) diversity across populations decreased with increasing latitude. Coastal populations showed significantly higher haplotype diversity (but not nucleotide diversity) than pond populations, but there were no detectable differences in haplotype diversity among different freshwater habitat types (viz. river, lake and pond populations), or between coastal and lake/river populations. Sequences were found to cluster according to their geographic proximity, rather than by habitat type, and all habitat types were found within each major clade, implying that colonisation and adaptation between the coastal and freshwater environments in different regions must have occurred in parallel.

AB  - Biochar soil amendment may provide the forestry sector with a formidable tool to simultaneously sequester carbon (C) in the soil and aboveground by enhancing plant productivity, yet several key uncertainties remain. Crucially, empirical evidence of long-term effects of biochar management on vegetation and on greenhouse gas emissions in forest ecosystems is scarce. Using a large field experiment in a young managed boreal forest in northern Sweden, we investigated the effects of biochar (applied either on the soil surface or mixed in the soil 8-9 years prior to this study) on supply rates of soil nutrients, on survival and growth of planted Pinus sylvestris, on community composition of the understory vegetation, and on forest floor fluxes of N2O, CH4, and CO2. We found that biochar promoted P. sylvestris survival only when biochar was applied on the soil surface. Conversely, biochar enhanced P. sylvestris growth overall, resulting in a 19% increase in C stored in biomass. Biochar also altered the composition of the understory vegetation, especially when mixed into the soil, and promoted a more resource-conservative community (i.e., with more ericaceous shrubs and less graminoids and forbs). Meanwhile, supply rates of the main soil nutrients were largely unaffected by biochar. Finally, we found that biochar did not alter overall N2O and CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake from the forest floor. Our findings show that biochar amendment increased the net C input to the system, since, besides directly increasing soil C stocks, biochar enhanced biomass growth without increasing soil C losses. Therefore, our study suggests that biochar could potentially be used for emissions abatement in intensively managed boreal forests.

AB  - The sustainability of aquaculture is a complex issue that can be hard to assess and communicate. Communicating it to the general public is in many ways an even bigger challenge than communicating to experts on sustainability or aquaculture. The general public's perception of the status and challenges for sustainability is important for the development of the aquaculture industry and for society at large, through its roles both as consumers and electorate, and generally in providing or denying a "social license to operate" for the industry. This paper presents the process and challenges involved in choosing and quality assuring sustainability indicators for Norwegian aquaculture, covering environmental, economic, and social dimensions. It involved a team of researchers, a quality assurance group, IT developers and designers, a literature review, a national survey, and user-testing, all to establish criteria for selecting data and indicators and how to present them, and to do the actual production. The endpoint is a web-portal with indicators currently covering 22 themes, aimed at anyone interested in the sustainability of Norwegian fish farming. The portal does not conclude if or to what degree Norwegian fish farming is sustainable, as that would require making valuation and trade-offs among different sustainability objectives. Many indicators are automatically updated, and data are only from publicly available sources and produced by the authorities or research institutions. The portal is under continuous development, with new themes and indicators, and improving spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - Higher tree species richness often increases the diversity of other taxonomic groups and is promoted in many managed forest systems. The reason for the higher diversity is due to, for example, inter-specific differences in resource filtering of the trees. Resource filtering also depends on the total density of the tree layer, but the interaction between tree species composition and density is, so far, unexplored. Likewise, few studies have addressed whether mixtures of tree species host higher diversity, or support higher productivity, of other taxa than monocultures of the same tree species. We use a gradient in overstory tree species composition, ranging from pure Norway spruce (Picea abies) to pure Birch (Betula sp.), combined with a gradient from open to closed forest, to assess the joint effects of tree species mixture and forest density on the understory vegetation. The cover and species richness of understory vascular plants increased with an increasing proportion of birch and decreased with increasing forest density, while the cover of bryophytes decreased with an increasing proportion of birch and increasing forest density. There were clear interactions between tree species composition and forest density; the decrease in vascular plants with forest density was stronger in forest dominated by spruce than in forests dominated by birch, and the positive effect of an increasing proportion of birch was smaller in dense than in open forests. There were no indications of mixed forests supporting a higher species richness or plant cover than any of the two monocultures. Additionally, few species (10%) showed tendencies toward a higher probability of occurrence in mixed forests, and most of these also occurred in open pure stands. Our results indicate a potential conflict between goals for diversified forests and increased biomass production, as the positive effects for understory vegetation from mixtures may be lost to concomitant increases in forest density. Furthermore, the limited number of species benefiting from mixtures per se indicates that similar biodiversity benefits for understory vegetation may be obtained at landscape levels from the increased use of broadleaf and lower-density production stands, as from mixtures.

AB  - In addition to flooding and water quality management, blue-green infrastructure (BGI) provides multiple benefits to humans and ecosystems, including health and biodiversity. Various tools are available for assessing these benefits but few evaluate economic benefits. Two tools that monetize the benefits, the Benefits Estimation Tool (B ST) pound (UK) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) (Netherlands), have been used to estimate value for a case study in Lulea, Sweden. Three options for a newly developed area were assessed in comparison with two different baselines. The main economic benefits of the newly developed area were related to amenities, home values, health, and social cohesion rather than to stormwater. However, as a result of the proposed development, negative economic benefits (i.e., costs) were attributed to carbon sequestration and biodiversity when considering the value of the existing area due to a loss of green spaces and trees. B ST pound gave higher negative impacts than TEEB. Direct comparison of each category used in each tool was not possible since these categories and the way in which the monetized values are determined in each case differ. While the overall approach used in both tools is applicable in Sweden, calculations and data used need to be adapted to local circumstances and valuation.

AB  - As different macrophyte habitats house different distributions of invertebrates, we questioned if differences in the composition of fish in these habitats also could be identified. Additionally, we addressed the question if the fish communities could be affected a few years after sugar kelp beds had shifted to degraded turf habitats. Gill-nets of different mesh sizes were used to catch fish in the then four dominating subtidal macrophyte habitats; the kelp species Laminaria hyperborea and Saccharina latissima, the turf algae, and the seagrass Zostera marina. Each habitat was sampled in South Norway, day and night, and at two following months. Altogether, 31 species of fish and five species of larger crustaceans were caught. Both individuals and species numbers were dominated by wrasses and codfish. The wrasses were most active at daytime, while most codfish entered the habitats at night. Wrasses were mainly occurring in the seaweed habitats, while codfish dominated the seagrass samples. The kelps had highest numbers of individuals, while seagrasses showed highest species diversity. The turf habitats did not result in dramatic negative effects on the fish fauna. Fish can take advantage of other adjacent habitats, a benefit that could be reduced by expanding shifts from kelps to turfs.

AB  - Seabirds can strongly affect several major factors correlated with species diversity by concentrating marine nutrients on their nesting islands and by physically disturbing island vegetation. In this study, we investigated the effects of nesting cormorants on the abundance, species richness, and composition of plants and arthropods (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Araneae, and Chironomidae) on islands in Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Nesting cormorants negatively affected plant species richness and vegetation cover and that changed plant species composition. The effect of nesting cormorants on island arthropods varied between feeding groups and sampling methods. Most orders did not change in abundance or species richness but some, such as coleopterans and spiders changed in species composition. Herbivorous coleopterans were generally negatively affected by cormorants whereas fungivorous species and scavengers were generally positively affected. In structural equation modeling we found that the effect of cormorants was sometimes direct, such as on scavengers, but many effects on island consumers were mediated by changes in vegetation caused by cormorant presence. Overall, arthropod communities were highly dissimilar between cormorant and reference islands, and we therefore conclude that nesting cormorants not only affect the diversity of their nesting islands but also of the archipelago as a whole. The total diversity in the archipelago may increase through regional increased habitat heterogeneity and by adding species which are favored by seabirds (e.g. scavenging and fungivorous coleopterans).

Mimicking of the natural disturbances is considered a part of the forest management strategy in the particular areas. However, the diversity of the possible initial stand and landscape composition leads to the various corresponding pathways of recovery after the disturbance. So far, a limited number of short term (up to 25 years after the windthrow) empirical studies have assessed them in the hemiboreal forests. In this study, the stand development 45-46 years after the stand replacing windthrow was assessed in the north-western part of Latvia, Slitere National Park. In the areas formerly dominated by Norway spruce, the post-storm tree species composition was significantly altered by the site type. Birch dominated in the overstorey; however, the dominance of spruce was found in 12 and 33% of the areas in the mesic and wet sites, respectively; the understorey and the advanced regeneration were mostly (61 and 46%, respectively) formed by spruce. In most cases, the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the overstorey spruce was similar or larger than for pioneer species (except aspen), regardless of the proportion of spruce in the stand composition. The dimensions of spruce were significantly larger in mesic than in wet sites: DBH and height was 23.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 19.4 +/- 1.5 cm and 22.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 17.7 +/- 1.0 m, respectively. Regardless of the distance from the undamaged stand, the number of the overstorey spruce was similar, indicating the sufficient seed dispersal from the windthrown trees. However, on the wet sites, the proportion of spruce from the total number of trees was significantly higher in the areas up to 50 m from spruce stand that remained after the storm. Also, the abundance of the understorey spruce had significant positive relation to the distance to the undamaged stand. The results suggest that 45 years after the stand-replacing windthrow spruce is abundant within all stand layers and might dominate the overstorey besides the pioneer species.

AB  - When seeking to resolve complex land-management issues, geographical assessment of resources that are in short supply or in dispute can aid the communication of knowledge and the understanding among and between different stakeholders. In this paper, we illustrate how remote sensing and GIS can be used to gather and compile information regarding land-use activities and patterns among reindeer herders and other land users (forestry, mining, tourism, etc) in northern Sweden. The project represents a novel user-oriented effort largely based on the work carried out by-the principal end user, i.e. the reindeer herders themselves. The basis for development of land-use plans for reindeer husbandry, was the following: to collect and digitally systemize traditional ecological and landscape knowledge of reindeer habitat use; to integrate this information with results from field inventories and satellite-based vegetation classifications; to map activities of other land users. The resulting land-use plans provide information that can facilitate consultation between the reindeer herders and other stakeholders and can facilitate operational work in reindeer management. This project can serve as a model for participatory involvement and planning, bringing indigenous knowledge and advanced remote-sensing techniques together in an interactive process.

AB  - Shallow coastal soft bottoms are important carbon sinks. Submerged vegetation has been shown to sequester carbon, increase sedimentary organic carbon (C-org) and thus suppress greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The ongoing regression of seagrass cover in many areas of the world can therefore lead to accelerated emission of GHGs. In Nordic waters, seagrass meadows have a high capacity for carbon storage, with some areas being recognized as blue carbon hotspots. To what extent these carbon stocks lead to emission of methane (CH4) is not yet known. We investigated benthic CH4 emission (i.e., net release from the sediment) in relation to seagrass (i.e. Zostera marina) cover and sedimentary C-org content (%) during the warm summer period (when emissions are likely to be highest). Methane exchange was measured in situ with benthic chambers at nine sites distributed in three regions along a salinity gradient from similar to 6 in the Baltic Sea (Finland) to similar to 20 in Kattegat (Denmark) and similar to 26 in Skagerrak (Sweden). The net release of CH4 from seagrass sediments and adjacent unvegetated areas was generally low compared to other coastal habitats in the region (such as mussel banks and wetlands) and to other seagrass areas worldwide. The lowest net release was found in Finland. We found a positive relationship between CH4 net release and sedimentary C-org content in both seagrass meadows and unvegetated areas, whereas no clear relationship between seagrass cover and CH4 net release was observed. Overall, the data suggest that Nordic Zostera marina meadows release average levels of CH4 ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which is at least 12-78 times lower (CO2 equivalents) than their carbon accumulation rates previously estimated from seagrass meadows in the region, thereby not hampering their role as carbon sinks. Thus, the relatively weak CH4 emissions from Nordic Z. marina meadows will not outweigh their importance as carbon sinks under present environmental conditions.

AB  - Species diversity and interactions vary on a landscape scale and are sensitive to landscape alterations, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat degradation. At the same time, the species position within food webs or mutualistic networks (e. g. generalist or specialist, network hub or peripheral vertex) may affect their ability to persist after perturbations. This study was conducted in a heavily managed boreal forest landscape in southeastern Norway, using study plots situated in forest stands with contrasting disturbance history: old growth forest (least disturbed), young forest (intermediate) and clear cuts (most disturbed). By studying 12 pollination networks with contrasting disturbance history we found that important network descriptors were conserved after perturbation. Link-diversity was higher, both overall and per site, in the more disturbed communities while link-turnover was highest in the least disturbed community. We conclude that despite an increase in diversity in the more degraded habitat, the higher link-turnover in the least degraded, old growth forest, community indicates a homogenization of the plant-pollinator networks as a result of habitat degradation. Finally, we found that the degree (number of interacting partners) and network functional role for particular species changed along the disturbance gradient, though not in any systematic way. We conclude that structural properties of the pollination network are conserved after perturbations, but that particular species' network functional roles may change.

AB  - Intensification of forestry may further increase the threat that forestry already imposes on biodiversity. The recent re-introduction of stump harvest in Swedish forestry clearly represents such intensification. Stump harvest not only decreases the available habitat for organisms living on dead wood, but also causes soil disturbance that can potentially alter understory diversity. In this study we capitalized on the large-scale stump harvest (c. 10,000 ha) that took place during the period from 1977 to 1989 in south-central Sweden. In 2013, we performed vegetation surveys in forest stands where stumps were harvested and in conventionally harvested reference stands. Twenty-four to 36 years after stump harvest we found no differences in species richness and composition of vascular plants and mosses between the two categories of stands. We conclude that our study lends no support for any long-term effects of stump harvest on understory vegetation. The lack of differences between stump harvested and conventional clear-cut stands may be due to that the additional disturbance effects generated by stump harvest were overridden by the strong disturbance effects already imposed by the standard forest management, i.e. clear-cutting with subsequent soil scarification.

AB  - Unique information on the characteristics of intra- and interpopulation genetic differentiation of various salmonids has been accumulated during the last 25 years, mostly be electrophoresis of protein polymorphisms, and more recently by DNA polymorphism analysis. Almost simultaneously, polygenic morphological variation was being studied, and selection for growth and maturation rates has founded a basis for aquaculture. Achievements in Norway and Scotland signal the wide prospects opened up by genetics and selection for the fish industry.
   However, progress in selection of organisms has been gained always at the expense of a change of genetic variability, and results in decreased fitness. Another consequent problem for salmonids is the influence of artificially produced fish on wild populations. A compromise is needed to maintain a steady level of economic benefit while countering the negative effects of directional selection. Therefore investigators must understand clearly the genetic structure of wild and hatchery populations of salmonids. To this end they should combine the approaches, methods and possibilities of quantitative with those of Mendelian genetics.
   The present paper considers this thesis. focussing on Pacific (Oncorhynchus) and Atlantic (Salmo) salmon species. In particular it deals with: (i) specific features of intra- and interpopulation genetic differentiation; (ii) major factors responsible for maintaining protein polymorphism in the populations; and (iii) effects of human impacts (e.g. fisheries, transfers and artificial reproduction) on the genetic structure of populations. It concludes with a scheme of artificial reproduction to maintain optimal levels of gene diversity, specific for each population and for its preservation in time and space.

AB  - Saving the remaining natural forests in northern Europe has been one of the main goals to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. To facilitate the recognition, mapping and efficient conservation of natural forests, there is an urgent need for a general formulation, based on ecological patterns and processes, of the concept of "forest naturalness". However, complexity, structural idiosyncracy and dynamical features of unmanaged forest ecosystems at various spatio-temporal scales pose major challenges for such a formulation. The definitions hitherto used for the concept of forest naturalness can be fruitfully grouped into three dimensions: 1) structure-based concepts of natural forest, 2) species-based concepts of natural forest and 3) process-based concepts of natural forest. We propose that explicit and simultaneous consideration of all these three dimensions of naturalness can better cope with the natural variability of forest states and also aid in developing strategies for forest conservation and management in different situations. To become operational, criteria and indicators of forest naturalness need to integrate the three dimensions by combining species (e.g. red-listed-, indicator- and umbrella species) with stand and landscape level structural features that are indicative of disturbance and succession processes.

AB  - Three field experiments with broadened permanent field boundaries were established in agricultural landscapes near Uppsala (southern Sweden). One aim was to test methods for increasing the amount of non-cultivated areas with high plant species diversity and at the same time suppressing the occurrence of weeds. The treatments consisted of re-establishing or broadening boundary strips, sowing a mixture of ley grasses and clover, of wild meadow species, or planting bushes. All treatments were managed by yearly mowing and taking away of the plant material. The vegetation was examined on two occasions during a 10-year period. At the second occasion, a set of untreated field boundaries (reference boundaries) in the vicinity of each experiment was examined for comparison. Sowing meadow species changed the species composition substantially compared to untreated boundaries. Out of 32 sown species, 22 remained after 10 years. These species are normally found in well-managed meadows or pastures. Species that did not establish or disappeared tended to be either adapted to moist or to dry conditions. Sowing meadow species kept the abundance of weeds on a lower level than sowing clover and grasses or free regeneration at one site and kept weed abundance lower or at least not higher than in reference boundaries.

AB  - Land management policies, which emphasize timber production and biodiversity conservation may neglect other important services that these landscapes provide, such as the recreational opportunities that are particularly important in urban forests and woodlands. The quality of recreational opportunities in forested lands is largely dictated by the degree of human influence on the landscape, including forestry, recreational facilities, infrastructure and other man-made constructions. We present a four-part conceptual model based on the recreation opportunity spectrum framework, and tested it by using survey data and automatic counters in urban forests of Oslomarka in Norway. We find empirical support for the four-part planning concept. The pragmatic model may inspire forest landowners, land managers and planners to envision potential contributions to recreational opportunities by identifying four broad categories of suitability for recreational activities labelled: general consideration-, special consideration-, service- and wilderness areas. The conceptual framework can be used as a tool to plan and manage for recreational opportunities at different spatial scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shrub communities have expanded in arctic and alpine tundra during recent decades. Changes in shrub abundance may alter ecosystem carbon (C) sequestration and storage, with potential positive or negative feedback on global C cycling. To assess potential implications of shrub expansion in different alpine plant communities, we compared C fluxes and pools in one Empetrum-dominated heath, one herb- and cryptogam-dominated meadow, and one Salix-shrub community in Central Norway. Over two growing seasons, we measured Gross Ecosystem Photosynthesis, Ecosystem Respiration (ER), and C pools for above-ground vegetation, litter, roots, and soil separated into organic and mineral horizons. Both the meadow and shrub communities had higher rates of C fixation and ER, but the total ecosystem C pool in the meadow was twice that of the shrub community because of more C in the organic soil horizon. Even though the heath community had the lowest rates of C fixation, it stored one and a half times more C than the shrub community. The results indicate that the relatively high above-ground biomass sequestering C during the growing season is not associated with high C storage in shrub-dominated communities. Instead, shrub-dominated areas may be draining the carbon-rich alpine soils because of high rates of decomposition. These processes were not shown by mid-growing season C fluxes, but were reflected by the very different distribution of C pools in the three habitats.

AB  - Short-rotation coppice (SRC) Salix plantations have the potential to provide fast-growing biomass feedstock with significant soil and climate mitigation benefits. Salix varieties exhibit significant variation in their physiological traits, growth patterns and soil ecology-but the effects of these variations have rarely been studied from a systems perspective. This study analyses the influence of variety on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and climate impacts from Salix cultivation for heat production for a Swedish site with specific conditions. Soil carbon modelling was combined with a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to quantify SOC sequestration and climate impacts over a 50-year period. The analysis used data from a Swedish field trial of six Salix varieties grown under fertilized and unfertilized treatments on Vertic Cambisols during 2001-2018. The Salix systems were compared with a reference case where heat is produced from natural gas and green fallow was the land use alternative. Climate impacts were determined using time-dependent LCA methodology-on a land-use (per hectare) and delivered energy unit (per MJ(heat)) basis. All Salix varieties and treatments increased SOC, but the magnitude depended on the variety. Fertilization led to lower carbon sequestration than the equivalent unfertilized case. There was no clear relationship between biomass yield and SOC increase. In comparison with reference cases, all Salix varieties had significant potential for climate change mitigation. From a land-use perspective, high yield was the most important determining factor, followed by SOC sequestration, therefore high-yielding fertilized varieties such as 'Tordis', 'Tora' and 'Bjorn' performed best. On an energy-delivered basis, SOC sequestration potential was the determining factor for the climate change mitigation effect, with unfertilized 'Jorr' and 'Loden' outperforming the other varieties. These results show that Salix variety has a strong influence on SOC sequestration potential, biomass yield, growth pattern, response to fertilization and, ultimately, climate impact.

AB  - The dynamics of water and energy fluxes in the high mountains of central Norway was studied along micro-spatial topographic gradients in different altitudes and regions of the Scandes. Landscape ecological processes like snow accumulation during winter, snow melting, evaporation, percolation, soil moisture variability and temperature variations were quantified. Combining spatio-temporal data on physical environment functioning and vegetation patterns resulted in a process-oriented characterisation of high mountain ecosystems. Extensive data from long-term measurements were synthesised illustrating the influence of micro-climate, snow cover, and soil moisture on high mountain ecosystem functioning. The results reveal that the micro-climatic impact on the vegetation is predominantly determined by snow cover overlaying soil moisture gradients. Water only becomes superior where near-surface water saturation and flooding occur. A lack of soil moisture availability was not found during any time of the year even under driest site conditions. Contrasting literature, the Norwegian mountain vegetation was found to be interpreted by environmental variable constellations excluding drought stress.

AB  - The importance of forest strips along communication routes has to be put into the context of stand stability, resilience to disturbances and biodiversity while satisfying societal needs. In order to address such important issues, through the data provided by the forest management plans, an analysis of the forest stands structure and composition of the forest stands in the Transylvanian alps in Romania was carried out. The forest distribution according to age and species has provided an uneven aged, multi-layered forest with a high tree and plant communities diversity, which according to the slenderness index, have shown a high degree of stability and resilience. Based on species diversity above ground, the stands have shown increased biodiversity from a plant community point of view and an enhanced structural connectivity. The species richness in mixed broadleaved forests was higher than in pure stands whereas, in resinous forests, the species richness was higher in pure spruce stands as compared to mixed stands where spruce participation was secondary. On a national scale, Natura 2000 sites consists of more than 25% of the total forested area, contributing to the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, EU Green Deal and the EU Forest strategy 2030 targets and commitments.

AB  - Background: Columnaris disease caused by Flavobacterium columnare is a serious problem in aquaculture, annually causing large economic losses around the world. Despite considerable research, the molecular epidemiology of F. columnare remains poorly understood.
   Methods: We investigated the population structure and spatiotemporal changes in the genetic diversity of F. columnare population in Finland by using a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and analysis (MLSA) based on DNA sequence variation within six housekeeping genes. A total of 83 strains of F. columnare were collected from eight different areas located across the country between 2003 and 2012.
   Results: Partial sequencing of six housekeeping genes (trpB, tuf, atpA, rpoD, gyrB and dnaK) revealed eight sequence types and a moderate level of genetic diversity (H = 0.460). Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated protein-encoding gene sequence data (ca. 3,509 nucleotides) formed two lineages, which could be further divided into five clusters. All analysed F. columnare strains appeared to have a genetic origin distinct from that of another important fish pathogen form the genus Flavobacterium, F. psychrophilum. Although the value of the index of association between alleles, 0.292 (P < 0.001), supports some degree of clonality for this species in Finland, recombination has introduced molecular diversity to the population almost three times more than mutation.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that Finnish F. columnare strains have an epidemic population structure followed by clonal expansion of successful genotypes. Our study with reproducible methodology and comparable results establishes a robust framework for the discrimination and phylogenetic analysis of F. columnare isolates, which will help to improve our understanding about geographic distribution and epidemiology of columnaris disease.

AB  - Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with study site averages ranging from 600 to 1400 km(2) for resident males and from 300 to 800 km(2) for resident females. When home range sizes were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be conserved in the multiuse seminatural forest habitats that cover large areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding, and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest). Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these conflicts, and finding solutions.

AB  - The European Union-funded ECASA project (Ecosystem Approach for Sustainable Aquaculture) studied the impacts from aquaculture on ecosystems from northern Norway to Greece. The objectives of this investigation were to identify quantitative indicators of the effects of aquaculture on marine communities. and to assess their applicability over a range of ecosystems and aquaculture production systems. The study included 6 Mediterranean and 4 Atlantic sites, 7 of which produced finfish (seabream, seabass, tuna, salmon and cod), and 2 bivalve molluscs (oysters, mussels, and clams); one site produced both fish and bivalves. Cultivation methods included finfish cages, long-lines and trestles. Similar sampling methodologies were employed at the 10 study sites, obtaining sediment, hydrodynamic, and benthic faunal data. The horizontal impact from organic enrichment extended 50 m from the farms, with contradictory responses in several indicators (individual abundance, biomass) and a more consistent response of the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). By means of Partial Redundancy Analysis, it was demonstrated that the environmental variables explained 53.2% of the variability in the macrofaunal variables (individual abundance, species richness. diversity, AMBI and ITI), whilst the explained variance was partialled out within three groups of variables: (i) 'hydrography' (depth, distance to farm, average current speed), which explained 11.5% of the variance; (ii)'sediment'(Eh and percentages of silt and total organic matter), which explained 5.4%: and (iii) 'cages' (years of production and annual production), which explained 15.2%. The shared variance explained by interactions among these groups was 21.1%. These results, together with multiple regression analysis, provide an accurate assessment of the degree of impact from aquaculture. In conclusion, the use of several benthic indicators, in assessing farm impacts, together with the investigation of dynamics of the studied location, water depth, years of farm activity, and total annual production, must be included when interpreting the response of benthic communities to organic enrichment from aquaculture.

Adult mosquitoes representing 17 species and 6 genera were collected in July and August 1998. Although the 2 trap types did not differ significantly in total number of adult female mosquitoes collected, CF2000 traps captured a greater diversity of mosquito species and significantly more adult males than did CDC traps. Interspecific differences in capture rates and interactions between trap type and location also were observed.

AB  - Additions of nutrients, faster growing tree varieties, more intense harvest practices, and a changing climate all have the potential to increase forest production in Sweden, thereby mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration and fossil fuel substitution. However, the effects of management strategies for increased biomass production on soil resources and water quality at landscape scales are inadequately understood. Key knowledge gaps also remain regarding the sustainability of shorter rotation periods and more intensive biomass harvests. This includes effects of fertilization on the long-term weathering and supply of base cations and the consequences of changing mineral availability for future forest production. Furthermore, because soils and surface waters are closely connected, management efforts in the terrestrial landscape will potentially have consequences for water quality and the ecology of streams, rivers, and lakes. Here, we review and discuss some of the most pertinent questions related to how increased forest biomass production in Sweden could affect soils and surface waters, and how contemporary forestry goals can be met while minimizing the loss of other ecosystem services. We suggest that the development of management plans to promote the sustainable use of soil resources and water quality, while maximizing biomass production, will require a holistic ecosystem approach that is placed within a broader landscape perspective.

AB  - Protected areas worldwide are important to maintaining biodiversity and providing recreational opportunities to society. However, many protected areas are affected by unprecedented, large and severe natural disturbances, like bark beetle outbreaks. Due to the contrasting responses of different taxonomic groups to disturbance events and largely negative human perceptions of disturbed landscapes, there are conflicting opinions about the appropriate way of managing affected stands. Aligning these different objectives and understanding the responses of biodiversity and visitors' perceptions to different disturbance severities is a prerequisite for disturbance management in protected areas. We conducted multi-taxon biodiversity surveys - including meta barcoding hyperdiverse groups such as insects and fungi - and analysed the restorativeness (i.e. the landscape's ability to renew personal cognitive capacities for forest visitors) using visitor surveys in five national parks throughout Europe. Response curves of biodiversity and restorativeness were analysed along a continuous gradient of bark beetle infestation severities in Norway spruce forests on the same study plots. Arthropod biomass and the diversity of primary producers and pollinators increased linearly with increasing disturbance severity, while overall multi-diversity (an index of the average scaled species richness per taxonomic group) did not change. Restorativeness decreased linearly with increasing disturbance severity; however, even heavily disturbed forests still had high restorativeness. In spite of the ongoing debates about disturbance management, the high biodiversity and restorativeness that accompany disturbance suggest that major goals of protected areas are not threatened by bark beetle disturbances.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Forests in mountains are similarly affected by environmental changes like those in northern latitudes as species are closer to the edge of their ecological niche. There are recent studies that report species-specific responses to climate change in unmanaged, mono-layered mountain mixed forests. We analyze how environmental changes modify the growth of multi-layered, managed selection forest, which are often targeted for stabilization and risk prevention. We pose the central hypothesis that different species-specific susceptibility to disturbances and structural diversity contribute to ecosystem stability. Materials and Methods: Based on the long-term experiment Freyung 129 in the montane zone of the Bavarian Forest, Germany we analyze long term chronologies of periodic single tree and stand growth of Norway Spruce, silver fir, and European beech in dependence of environmental factors and forest management. Results: First, we show that despite environmental changes in terms of air pollution and drought stress, productivity at stand level persists constantly because of structural diversity and species traits. Second, we show that the species-specific contribution to total stand growth and growth distribution among stem diameter classes may change over time; the species interactions balance total growth. Third, we reveal a role reversal of tree species growth pattern. N. spruce was superior in growth in the first half and was replaced by s. fir in the second half of the survey period. Fourth, we identify the interplay of different stress factors on species-specific growth as the main cause for species-specific asynchronous but growth stabilizing reaction pattern. Finally, we show that density regulation was limited in its impacts to mitigate prevailing stress factors. Conclusions: We discuss the reasons for the observed stability of productivity. We interpret results, where especially the diversity of species and structure typical for selection forests result in stable productivity and wider plateau of the density-productivity relationship, and the suitability of the selection forest concept for risk prevention and stress resilience. We conclude that species composition and stand structure of selection forestry in mixed mountain contribute to climate smart forestry.

AB  - Managed forests serve as a store of carbon (C) and a renewable source of energy and materials. By using forest products as substitutes for fossil fuels or non-renewable materials, emissions from fossil C sources can be displaced. The efficiency of emissions displacement depends on the product, its lifecycle and the fossil-fuel based reference system that is substituted. Forest management practices have an impact on C stocks in biomass and on the annual supply of products and their mix. There are trade-offs between sequestering C stocks in forests and the climatic benefits obtained by sustainable forest harvesting and using wood products to displace fossil C emissions. This article presents an integrated, steady-state analysis comparing various equilibrium states of managed forests and wood product pools that represent sustainable long-term forestry and wood-use strategies. Two climatic indicators are used: the combined C stock in forests and wood products and the fossil C emissions displaced annually by harvested wood products. The study indicates that long-term strategies could be available that are better according to both indicators than forestry practices based on the existing silvicultural guidelines in Finland. These strategies would involve increasing the basal area and prolonging rotations to produce more sawlogs. Further, the climate benefits appear to be highest in case the sawlog supply is directed to production of long-lived materials substituting for fossil-emission and energy intensive materials and recycled after their useful life to bioenergy.

AB  - Temperate forests have recently been identified as being continuing sinks for carbon even in their mature and senescent stages. However, modeling exercises indicate that a warmer and drier climate as predicted for parts of Central Europe may substantially alter the source/sink function of these economically important ecosystems. In a transect study with 14 mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests growing on uniform geological substrate, we analyzed the influence of a large reduction of annual precipitation (970-520 mm yr-1) on the carbon stocks in fast and slow pools, independent of the well-known aging effect. We investigated the C storage in the organic L, F, H layers, the mineral soil to 100 cm, and in the biomass (stem, leaves, fine roots), and analyzed the dependence of these pools on precipitation. Soil organic carbon decreased by about 25% from stands with > 900 mm yr-1 to those with < 600 mm yr-1; while the carbon storage in beech stems slightly increased. Reduced precipitation affected the biomass C pool in particular in the fine root fraction but much less in the leaf biomass and stem fractions. Fine root turnover increased with a precipitation reduction, even though stand fine root biomass and SOC in the organic L, F, and H layers decreased. According to regression analyses, the C storage in the organic layers was mainly controlled by the size of the fine root C pool suggesting an important role of fine root turnover for the C transfer from tree biomass to the SOC pool. We conclude that the long-term consequence of a substantial precipitation decrease would be a reduction of the mineral soil and organic layer SOC pools, mainly due to higher decomposition rates. This could turn temperate beech forests into significant carbon sources instead of sinks under global warming.

AB  - The distribution of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker (Leiopicus medius) is restricted to mature deciduous forests with large trees, mainly oaks (Quercus spp.). Intensive forest management resulted in the loss of many suitable habitats, thus resulting in a decline in the population of this species. This study aimed to identify the parameters of foraging sites in the breeding season (April to June) and in the non-breeding season (other months). The research was conducted in the primeval oak-lime-hornbeam forest of the Bialowieza National Park, where foraging woodpeckers were observed and detailed parameters of foraging sites were recorded. During the breeding season woodpeckers foraged primarily on European hornbeams (Carpinus betulus L.), but in non-breeding season the use of this tree species decreased by a factor of two, whereas the use of Norway spruces (Picea abies L.) increased more than twice. The most preferred tree species as a foraging site in both seasons was pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.). In the non-breeding season, woodpeckers foraged at sites located higher, and the foraging session was longer compared with the breeding season. In both seasons, woodpeckers preferred dead and large trees and prey gleaning from the tree surface was their dominant foraging technique. Our results confirmed the key role of oaks and large trees, but also revealed the importance of European hornbeams and Norway spruces as foraging sites for the Middle Spotted Woodpecker.

AB  - Quantitative information of tree biomass is useful for management planning and monitoring of the changes in carbon stock in both forest and agroforestry systems. An estimate of carbon stored in these systems can be useful for developing climate change mitigation strategies. A precise estimate of forest biomass is also important for other issues ranging from industrial forestry practices to scientific purposes. The individual tree-based biomass models serve as fundamental tools for precise estimates of carbon stock of species of interest in forest and agroforestry systems. We developed individual tree aboveground biomass models for Castanopsis indica using thirty-six destructively sampled tree data covering a wide range of tree size, site quality, growth stage, stand density, and topographic characteristics. We used diameter at breast height (DBH) as a main predictor and height-to-DBH ratio (a measure of tree slenderness) and wood density (a measure of stiffness and cohesiveness of wood fibres) as covariate predictors in modelling. We, hereafter, termed the biomass models with former two predictors as first category models (density independent models) and the models with all three predictors as second category models (density dependent models). Among various functions evaluated, a simple power function of the form 0.98 and RMSE<72.2) with no significant trend in the residuals. Since both density dependent and density independent models exhibit almost similar fit statistics and graphical features, one of them can be applied for desired accuracy, depending on the access of the input information required by the model. Our biomass models are site-specific, and their applications should therefore be limited to the growth stage, stand density, site quality, stand condition, and species distribution similar to those that formed the basis of this study. Further research is recommended to validate and verify our model using a larger dataset with a wider range of values for site quality, climatic and topographic characteristics, stand density, growth stage, and species distribution across Nepal.

AB  - Understanding the potential of forest ecosystems as global carbon sinks requires a thorough knowledge of forest carbon dynamics, including both sequestration and fluxes among multiple pools. The accurate quantification of biomass is important to better understand forest productivity and carbon cycling dynamics. Stand-based inventories (SBIs) are widely used for quantifying forest characteristics and for estimating biomass, but information may quickly become outdated in dynamic forest environments. Satellite remote sensing may provide a supplement or substitute. We tested the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimates modeled from a combination of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and topographic data, as well as SBI-derived variables in a Picea abies forest in the Western Carpathian Mountains. We employed Random Forests for non-parametric, regression tree-based modeling. Results indicated a difference in the importance of SBI-based and remote sensing-based predictors when estimating aboveground biomass. The most accurate models for biomass prediction ranged from a correlation coefficient of 0.52 for the TM- and topography-based model, to 0.98 for the inventory-based model. While Landsat-based biomass estimates were measurably less accurate than those derived from SBI, adding tree height or stand-volume as a field-based predictor to TM and topography-based models increased performance to 0.36 and 0.86, respectively. Our results illustrate the potential of spectral data to reveal spatial details in stand structure and ecological complexity.

AB  - Altitudinal difference increases the complexity of the response of tree growth to climate change in the mountainous areas, and may change the carbon sequestration capacity of forests under the ongoing warming climate. In this work, four tree-ring width chronologies from Pinus henryi Mast. growing at different altitudes of Shiyan, the northern subtropical China were developed. Results of Pearson correlation analysis, factor analysis and redundancy analysis indicate that tree growth-climate response models can be divided into two types according to the altitudinal gradient: the high-altitude model, represented by SWDH and WDSH above 1330 m a.s.l., and the low-altitude model, represented by WDSL and DDZL less than 1070 m a.s.l. The biggest difference between the two models is that tree growth at the low altitudes shows significantly negative response to temperature in the previous September-December and current April-May, and positive response to moisture conditions from the previous September to current May, April-May in particular; while the high-altitude ones show consistently positive responses to temperature in current February-April, but no significant response to seasonal moisture condition. The existence of a temperature-related altitudinal threshold between 1070 m a.s.l. to 1330 m a.s.l. may change the hydro-thermal combination models above and below the threshold, thus lead to the change of climatic response models along altitude gradient. 30-yr moving correlation analysis reveals that the relationships between tree growth and the limiting climatic factors present evident altitudinal difference: gradually strengthened at the high altitudes but weakened at the low altitudes. It is distinct that water availability and demand are critical for the growth of low-altitude trees, and high-altitude trees show a stronger positive response to climate warming, therefore could be an important carbon sink in the future. In addition, future forest management should focus on the low altitudes and formulate effective protection strategies.

AB  - We study the economic profitability of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Finland. We show a moderate rate of returns (1.0% in Northern and 1.4% in Southern Finland) for the PV system investments with time-of-use hot water heating. Optimized hot water heating increases the rate of return by 0.6 percentage points. We internalize the negative externalities of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation by presenting the hourly electricity prices as a function of emission permit costs. A 10 (sic)/tCO(2) increase in carbon price improves the PV investment rate of return by 0.3 percentage points.

AB  - Managed forests can play an important role in climate change mitigation due to their capacity to sequester carbon. However, it has proven difficult to harness their full potential for climate change mitigation. Managed forests are often referred to as socio-ecological systems as the human dimension is an integral part of the system. When attempting to change systems that are influenced by factors such as collective knowledge, social organization, understanding of the situation and values represented in society, initial intentions often shift due to the complexity of political, social and scientific interactions. Currently, the scientific literature is dispersed over the different factors related to the socio-ecological system. To examine the level of dispersion and to obtain a holistic view, we review climate change mitigation in the context of Swedish forest research. We introduce a heuristic framework to understand decision-making connected to climate change mitigation. We apply our framework to two themes which span different dimensions in the socio-ecological system: carbon accounting and bioenergy. A key finding in the literature was the perception that current uncertainties regarding the reliability of different methods of carbon accounting inhibits international agreement on the use of forests for climate change mitigation. This feeds into a strategic obstacle affecting the willingness of individual countries to implement forest related carbon emission reduction policies. Decisions on the utilization of forests for bioenergy are impeded by a lack of knowledge regarding the resultant biophysical and social consequences. This interacts negatively with the development of institutional incentives regarding the production of bioenergy using forest products. Normative disagreement about acceptable forest use further affects these scientific discussions and therefore is an over-arching influence on decision-making. With our framework, we capture this complexity and make obstacles to decision-making more transparent to enable their more effective resolution. We have identified the main research areas concerned with the use of managed forest in climate change mitigation and the obstacles that are connected to decision making.

AB  - The greatest known global response of lakes to climate change has been an increase in water temperatures. The responses of many lake fishes to warming water temperatures are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. We experimentally evaluated the responses of embryos from a group of cold, stenothermic fishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae) to increased incubation temperatures. Study groups included cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario (USA), and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi (Finland). Embryos from artificial crossings were incubated at water temperatures of 2.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 9.0 degrees C, and their responses were quantified for developmental and morphological traits. Embryo survival, incubation period, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to incubation temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with incubation temperature within study groups. However, varying magnitudes of responses among study groups suggested differential levels of developmental plasticity to climate change. Differential levels of parental effects indicate genetic diversity may enable all study groups to adapt to cope with some degree of changing environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the coregonines sampled within and among systems may have a wide range of embryo responses to warming incubation conditions.

AB  - Multi-taxon analyses of ecological assemblages are needed when the effects of forestry on biodiversity are examined. Management usually simplifies the structure of forests, which results in quantitative and qualitative declines in many microhabitats and species associated with them. In Fennoscandia, most forests are managed for industrial use of wood, but relatively little is known about the relationships between structural components and biodiversity in managed forests. Abundance, composition or species number of different species groups reacting similarly to variation in their environment would be a useful tool e.g. in estimating responses of species that are more difficult to sample. Thus far evidence for, or the lack of, such congruence or indicator functioning is not conclusive. We therefore examined the associations between stand structural features and species diversity and congruence between species groups of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, polypores and beetles. Our study was carried out in mature managed Norway spruce dominated forests in Southern Finland in 2009. Our main findings were (1) cross-taxon congruence in species richness was generally low, suggesting that any single taxonomic group performed poorly as an indicator of overall biodiversity; (2) the volume and diversity of dead trees were the most frequently detected significant predictors of species richness of the studied groups; (3) in terms of species composition, only vascular plants co-varied significantly with bryophytes and lichens; in addition, bryophytes and lichens as well as polypores co-varied significantly with stand structural features; (4) species composition of vascular plants, polypores and saproxylic beetles was associated with the volume of living trees, and in polypores it was also associated with the volumes of both dead and living deciduous trees. These results suggest that biodiversity monitoring for management and conservation requires data from several taxa. However, the volume and diversity of dead wood are useful indicators of stand-level species richness of several taxa, whereas the volume of living trees is an important indicator for the stand-level species composition of several groups. Thus, these structural variables have the potential to function as easily attainable indicators of general forest biodiversity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to study species richness and species composition of coprophilous ascomycetes in borcal forest. Dung was sampled at three localities and of three herbivores; moose (Alces alces), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Species richness differed significantly among dung types and we also found a significant effect of the interaction between locality and dung type on the mean number of species. The highest species richness was found on roe deer dung. While moose did not differ from mountain hare. There was a strong positive relationship between the total number of ascomycete species and the number of plant species foraged by the three herbivores. We believe that food choice is one important factor influencing the species richness of coprophilous ascomycetes, and that some species are more associated with habitat and food choice of the herbivore, rather than a specific dung type/animal species. The composition of species on the different dung types is also discussed. Our results suggests that the coprophilous mycota in the boreal forest is poorly known; we found 47 species in total, four species were undescribed. I was new to Sweden, 24 species were new records for the province, and we made a total of 22 new substrate records.

AB  - This paper analyzes socially optimal forest management in terms of the rotation period and strict protection of stands when society values biodiversity benefits and harvest revenue. By using species presence and decaying wood functions, the Hartman model is extended to tackle biodiversity. A parametric version is developed to assess optimal management by using Finnish data on 32 old-growth stands. The results suggest that delayed harvesting is the optimal solution if the society values the annual flow of biodiversity benefits from these forests at or above is an element of 106 per hectare on average. If the annual value of biodiversity benefits is at or above is an element of 502 per hectare, then old-growth forest are set aside from commercial harvesting permanently. With the reference value of biodiversity, 251 is an element of/ha/a derived from stated preference surveys, the parametric model shows that delayed harvesting is the most common option for the socially optimal management of old-growth forests, but two stands are preserved. In this case, the integrated approach maximizing both biodiversity benefits and harvest revenue results in considerably longer rotation periods than pure maximization of harvest revenue. The Hartman rotation ages and the number of permanently protected stands are, however, sensitive to the level of interest rate and stumpage prices. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analyse the short- and long-term consequences for atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations of forest management strategies and forest product uses in Sweden by comparing the modelled consequences of forest resource use vs. increased conservation at different levels of GHG savings from carbon sequestration and product substitution with bioenergy and other forest products. Increased forest set-asides for conservation resulted in larger GHG reductions only in the short term and only when substitution effects were low. In all other cases, forest use was more beneficial. In all scenarios, annual carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration rates declined in conservation forests as they mature, eventually approaching a steady state. Forest set-asides are thus associated with increasing opportunity costs corresponding to foregone wood production and associated mitigation losses. Substitution and sequestration rates under all other forest management strategies rise, providing support for sustained harvest and cumulative mitigation gains. The impact of increased fertilization was everywhere beneficial to the climate and surpassed the mitigation potential of the other scenarios. Climate change can have large-positive or negative-influence on outcomes. Despite uncertainties, the results indicate potentially large benefits from forest use for wood production. These benefits, however, are not clearly linked with forestry in UNFCCC reporting, and the European Union's Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry carbon accounting, framework may even prevent their full realization. These reporting and accounting frameworks may further have the consequence of encouraging land set-asides and reduced forest use at the expense of future biomass production. Further, carbon leakage and resulting biodiversity impacts due to increased use of more GHG-intensive products, including imported products associated with deforestation and land degradation, are inadequately assessed. Considerable opportunity to better mobilize the climate change mitigation potential of Swedish forests therefore remains.

AB  - Exactly 100 years ago the first national parks in Europe were established in Sweden. Since then there has been a veritable boom of newly designated protected areas across the globe while biodiversity has decreased all the while. There are manifold reasons why the global network of protected areas obviously fails to "achieve the long-term conservation of nature with its associated ecosystem services" (IUCN 2008). The Nature Conservancy, a US environmental NGO, for example, pointed out significant weaknesses in the design and management of protected areas which leave them vulnerable to threats such as population pressures or the effects of climate change. In order to deliver on their promise of a sustainable future, protected areas need to be well-funded, well-managed and have the support of both governments and society. This calls for professional staff. Frequently both natural and social scientists lack adequate training to deal successfully with the challenging tasks that come with managing a protected area.
   Nowadays this knowledge gap can be filled by special master courses on the "Management of Protected Areas". One of them was launched in 2005 at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria. The course has become an internationally well-established hub for training integrated management of protected areas. The application deadline for the new course is 30th of June 2009. It will start in September 2009 and run till June 2011.

AB  - During the past centuries Danish populations of Primula farinosa have seriously declined in number. We investigated the genetic structure and genetic diversity of plants of seven populations from two different regions, Zealand and Bornholm in Denmark, using three AFLP markers. Two populations from nearby Scania, Sweden were included as reference. We found 54 unambiguously polymorphic loci. The genetic structure analysis suggested division of the 268 plants into three distinct groups, to a large extent matching the geographical distribution of the populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated significant genetic differentiation of 67% within populations and 33% among the populations. Our results suggest that genetic differentiation among regions and unique local genetic diversity should carefully be considered in future conservation attempts if we are to maintain as much genetic variation as possible. We present a historical overview of the decline in Danish populations and discuss conservation management and restoration strategies.

AB  - We employed a forest ecosystem model (SIMA) to study how the changes in forest conservation area and management affect the volume growth, harvested amount of timber, carbon stock, and amount of deadwood in Finnish boreal upland forests under current and changing climates (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) over 2010-2099. Simulations were carried out on National Forest Inventory plots using three different forest conservation scenarios (baseline and 10% and 20% increases of conservation area) and three thinning regimes (baseline and maintenance of +/- 20% stocking in thinning compared with recommendations). An increase of forest conservation area increased the volume growth, carbon stock, and quantity of deadwood in forests, as did the maintenance of 20% higher stocking in thinning. Maintenance of 20% lower stocking in thinning increased, in general, the amount of harvested timber, but it could not compensate for the decrease of harvested timber due to increase of conservation area. Climate warming greatly increased all of the studied variables in northern Finland but decreased them in southern Finland, the most under the strongest climate warming scenario, RCP8.5. Climate warming also increased the quantity of deadwood throughout Finland. To conclude, we found clear trade-offs for production of different ecosystem services.

AB  - We investigated how the initial age structure of a managed, middle boreal (62A degrees N), Norway spruce-dominated (Picea abies L. Karst.) forest area affects the net climate impact of using forest biomass for energy. The model-based analysis used a gap-type forest ecosystem model linked to a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. The net climate impact of energy biomass refers to the difference in annual net CO2 exchange between the biosystem using forest biomass (logging residues from final felling) and the fossil (reference) system using coal. In the simulations over the 80-year period, the alternative initial age structures of the forest areas were (i) skewed to the right (dominated by young stands), (ii) normally distributed (dominated by middle-aged stands), (iii) skewed to the left (dominated by mature stands), and (iv) evenly distributed (same share of different age classes). The effects of management on net climate impacts were studied using current recommendations as a baseline with a fixed rotation period of 80 years. In alternative management scenarios, the volume of the growing stock was maintained 20% higher over the rotation compared to the baseline, and/or nitrogen fertilization was used to enhance carbon sequestration. According to the results, the initial age structure of the forest area affected largely the net climate impact of using energy biomass over time. An initially right-skewed age structure produced the highest climate benefits over the 80-year simulation period, in contrast to the left-skewed age structure. Furthermore, management that enhanced carbon sequestration increased the potential of energy biomass to replace coal, reducing CO2 emissions and enhancing climate change mitigation.

AB  - One promising approach to mitigate the negative impacts of insect pests in forests is to adapt forestry practices to create ecosystems that are more resistant and resilient to biotic disturbances. At the stand scale, local stand management practices often cause idiosyncratic effects on forest pests depending on the environmental context and the focal pest species. However, increasing tree diversity appears to be a general strategy for reducing pest damage across several forest types. At the landscape scale, increasing forest heterogeneity (e.g., intermixing different forest types and/or age classes) represents a promising frontier for improving forest resistance and resilience and for avoiding large-scale outbreaks. In addition to their greater resilience, heterogeneous forest landscapes frequently support a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. A challenge will be to develop cooperation and coordination among multiple actors at spatial scales that transcend historical practices in forest management.

AB  - Domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) play a vital role in the culture and livelihoods of indigenous people across northern Eurasia. These animals are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme cold, limited feed availability and long migration distances. Therefore, understanding the genomics of reindeer is crucial for improving their management, conservation and utilisation. In this study, we have generated a new genome assembly for the Fennoscandian domestic reindeer with high contiguity, making it the most complete reference genome for reindeer to date. The new genome assembly was utilised to explore genetic diversity, population structure and selective sweeps in Eurasian Rangifer tarandus populations which was based on the largest population genomic dataset for reindeer, encompassing 58 individuals from diverse populations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct genetic clusters, with the Finnish wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) standing out as a unique subspecies. Divergence time estimates suggested a separation of similar to 52 thousand years ago (Kya) between the northern European Rangifer tarandus fennicus and Rangifer tarandus tarandus. Our study identified four main genetic clusters: Fennoscandian, the eastern/northern Russian and Alaskan group, the Finnish forest reindeer, and the Svalbard reindeer. Furthermore, two independent reindeer domestication processes were inferred, suggesting separate origins for the domestic Fennoscandian and eastern/northern Russian reindeer. Notably, shared genes under selection, including retroviral genes, point towards molecular domestication processes that aided adaptation of this species to diverse environments.

AB  - Roots mobilize nutrients via deep soil penetration and rhizosphere processes inducing weathering of primary minerals. These processes contribute to C transfer to soils and to tree nutrition. Assessments of these characteristics and processes of root systems are important for understanding long-term supplies of nutrient elements essential for forest growth and resilience. Research and techniques have significantly advanced since Olof Tamm's 1934 "base mineral index" for Swedish forest soils, and the basic nutrient budget estimates for whole-tree harvesting systems of the 1970s. Recent research in areas that include some of the world's most productive and intensively managed forests, including Brazil and the USA, has shown that root systems are often several meters in depth, and often extend deeper than soil is sampled. Large amounts of carbon are also sometimes stored at depth. Other recent studies on potential release of nutrients due to chemical weathering indicate the importance of root access to deep soil layers. Nutrient release profiles clearly indicate depletion in the top layers and a much higher potential in B and C horizons. Reviewing potential sustainability of nutrient supplies for biomass harvesting and other intensive forest management systems will advance understanding of these important ecosystem properties, processes and services relevant for management.

AB  - There is a need for large-scale demonstrations to address the challenges and possibilities for upscaling of ecosystem restoration, and for learning and sharing knowledge across professions and habitats. Large-scale and complex restoration projects need new perspectives on goal formulation, indicators for success, and evaluation to encompass both scientific approaches and the tacit knowledge held by practitioners. The objective of this paper is to use the restoration of a 165 km(2) former military training area in alpine central Norway into National Park to demonstrate the challenges of upscaling and integration. Main tasks were to remove roads and technical infrastructure, prepare for natural recovery and remove undetonated ordnance. In total, 19 indicators were used to evaluate the restoration outcome, related to four overall restoration goals formulated by the Norwegian Parliament: nature protection, considerable nature benefit, safe civilian use, and restoration back to natural state. Despite an overall linear project cycle, a dynamic and adaptive process of planning, implementation and evaluation was performed at the individual site scale. A dynamic dialogue between all involved professions allowed for exchanging scientific and tacit knowledge, and continuous improvement of solutions. The study demonstrated the relevance of qualitative assessments combined with quantitative indicators - i.e., use of expert opinions and the continuous evaluation to feed back into planning and improving the implementation of restoration measures. A "Green training " procedure was developed, linking top-down formally defined settings of the project with bottom-up hand-on solutions. This procedure can be directly transferred to other large-scale mitigation and restoration projects. Demonstration sites like the one described here, are valuable to develop an expanded vision of restoration to meet the UN Sustainable Goals.

AB  - Scale dependence is a fundamentally important topic in ecology because it determines whether results can be generalized over different spatial scales. We Studied the relationship between forage consumption by moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) and forage availability across six nested spatial scales in south-central Sweden. By using multiple regression, we concluded that the amount of available forage was the best single variable explaining absolute consumption, irrespectively of scale. Forage species diversity, site productivity, and moose density were also important for predicting forage consumption, but their effects differed across the different spatial scales. A multiple regression including forage availability, moose density, site productivity, and forage diversity explained between 31% and 49% of the variation in forage consumption. The importance of a moose index as an explanatory variable decreased with increasing spatial scale, whereas the importance of site productivity increased. According to model selection based on Akaike's information criterion, the same model was ranked highest at the four smallest spatial scales, whereas the top-ranked models at the two largest spatial scales differed. Furthermore, the relationship between consumption and forage availability changed from underutilization at small scales to proportional use at the home range level. Thus, for a comprehensive understanding of moose browsing in relation to food resources, we conclude that a multi-scale approach is necessary.

AB  - We examine how levels of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) change with succession in forests with different tree species composition. More specifically we ask how ecosystem age interacts with environmental conditions to regulate ES delivery. Using the nationwide Swedish forest inventory, comprising boreal and temperate regions, we investigated how levels of six provisioning, regulating, recreational, and/or cultural forest ESs changed with forest age (10-185 years) in stands of different tree species composition. We also tested whether the number of ESs delivered (i.e. multifunctionality) changed substantially with stand age, using different threshold levels for ES delivery. Accounting for environmental conditions and stand properties, we found that levels of single ESs changed with stand age. Tree biomass production usually peaked in young to medium aged stands. In contrast, production of berries and game, and services related to biodiversity, were typically highest in old stands (120-185 years). Consistent with this strong temporal tradeoff, multifunctionality at lower threshold levels increased with stand age in most monocultures and mixtures, with the highest multifunctionality being reached somewhere between 100 and 185 years, depending on tree species composition. This was not evident for the highest threshold ES level (the top-20%), however. Moreover, multifunctionality usually decreased with warmer climatic conditions, with the exception of spruce-pine-birch mixtures. Taken together, our results show that a reduced forest age, e.g. due to forestry targeting early harvest of stands, most likely would limit the delivery of several ESs valued by society and result in less multifunctional forests. To maintain the capacity of forests to deliver high levels of multiple ESs, the role of stand age and tree species composition should be considered in decisions on how to manage future forests.

AB  - The Kostomuksha State Nature Reserve (KSNR) is located in northwestern Russia, in the Republic of Karelia (hereinafter - Karelia), near the Finnish border. It has an area of 492.76 km(2). This Protected Area was established in 1983 to protect a typical area in the north-taiga subzone of European Russia. The paper contains the results of a long-term inventory of mosses. We critically checked own samples from 1995-1998 and 2016, deposited into the Herbarium of the Karelian Research Centre of RAS (PTZ). Own samples, collected in 2010, 2012 and 2017-2019, have been processed. All available data, including literature, were summarised. An annotated list of 180 moss species was compiled. It makes up 70% of the moss flora of the Kuitozero-Leksozero floristic province and about 35% of Karelia's moss flora. Twenty-six species are reported for the KSNR for the first time. Of them, six species (Campyliadelphus elodes, Racomitrium fasciculare, Didymodon rigidulus, Eurhynchium angustirete, Grimmia elatior, Grimmia torquata) are new to the Kuitozero-Leksozero floristic province. The distribution of some known species was clarified based on the latest records. The taxonomic and ecological-coenotic structure of the moss flora has been revealed. Most moss species (75%) are widespread in the north-taiga subzone of Karelia. There are five species included in the Red Data Book of the Republic of Karelia (2020): Campyliadelphus elodes (3 VU), Eurhynchium angustirete (3 VU), Neckera pennata (3 NT), Diobelonella palustris [=Dichodontium palustre] (3 VU), Sphagnum auriculatum (3 VU). For the first three protected species KSNR is the northernmost locality in Karelia and for Diobelonella palustris it is the only locality in Karelia. Nine species (Callicladium haldanianum (NT), Campyliadelphus elodes (NT), Dicranum spadiceum (VU), Mnium lycopodioides (NT), Neckera pennata (VU), Schistostega pennata (VU), Sphagnum contortum (NT), Sphagnum inundatum (EN), and Sphagnum subnitens (NT)) are included in the Red List of Finnish species (2019). Seven species (Campyliadelphus elodes (NT), Fontinalis dalecarlica (NT), Helodium blandowii (NT), Meesia triquetra (NT), Scorpidium scorpioides (NT), Splachnum ampullaceum (NT), and Tomentypnum nitens (NT)) are listed on the European Red List (2019). The moss flora of KSNR was compared with a few other Protected Areas in European Russia, along the country borders, in the north-taiga, namely Pasvik State Nature Reserve (Murmansk Region), Paanajarvi National Park, Kalevalsky National Park, and projected Tulos Nature Sanctuary (all three - Karelia).

AB  - Recently, the European Commission has adopted a Circular Economy package. In addition, climate change is regarded as a major global challenge, and the de-carbonization of the energy sector requires a massive transformation that involves an increase of renewable shares in the energy mix and the incorporation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes.
   Given all this strong new momentum, what will the Norwegian waste-to-energy (WtE) look like in a decade? What threats and opportunities are foreseen? In an attempt to answer these questions, this study combines process-based life-cycle assessment with analysis of the overall energy and material balances, mathematical optimization and cost assessment in four scenarios: (1) the current situation of the Norwegian WtE sector, (2) the implications of the circular economy, (3) the addition of CCS on the current WtE system and (4) a landfill scenario.
   Except for climate change, the CCS scenario performs worse than the WtE scenario. The energy recovering scenarios perform better than the recycling scenario for (1) freshwater eutrophication and human toxicity potentials due to secondary waste streams and (2) ozone depletion potential due to the additional fossil fuel used in the recycling processes. The inclusion of the near-term climate forcers decreases the climate change impacts by 1% to 13% due to a net cooling mainly induced by NOx.
   Circular economy may actually give the WtE system the opportunity to strengthen and expand its role towards new or little developed value chains such as secondary raw materials production and valorization of new waste streams occurring in material recycling.

AB  - The challenge to sustain food security while halting the loss of biodiversity and soil quality might be achieved by a transformation in agriculture from high-input management of annual crops to a more nature-based solution introducing perennial cropping systems. This study analysed earthworm communities (numbers, biomass, ecological categories) and diversity over two years, from annual wheat and perennial intermediate wheatgrass (IWG, Thinopyrum intermedium, Kernza (R)) within the EU-Biodiversa project NAPERDIV from Southern to Northern Europe. Study sites in France, Belgium and Sweden represented diverse soil, climatic and plant growth conditions. In total, 16 species were identified with IWG in France having the highest (13) and annual wheat in Belgium and Sweden the lowest (7) species numbers. Improved biodiversity under perennial wheat was indicated by alpha-diversity indices (Simpson index, Shannon-Weaver index, Evenness). Earthworm abundance and biomass were generally significantly higher in IWG across the three sites (GLMM model). The overall mean earthworm number under IWG was 424.7 No. m(-2) compared to 164.7 No. m(-2) for annual wheat. Mean earthworm biomass under IWG was 83.7 g m(-2) relative to 45.9 g m(-2) under annual wheat, respectively. Remarkably, mean number of juvenile earthworms was several times higher on IWG sites relative to the annual comparatives. Moreover, endogeic and epigeic earthworms were supported on the IWG plots. Beta diversity (Sorensen coefficient) emphasised highest similarity between Belgium and Sweden and lowest between France and Sweden, indicating a possible South to North distribution within Western Europe. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed discrete clusters for study sites and species distribution (including the subtypes of Allolobophora chlorotica) in relation to soil parameters (pH, soil texture, TOC, TN, WHC, C-N ratio). The CCA additionally discriminated between annual and perennial plots in France. In summary, earthworm communities were more diverse under IWG and seemed to follow a South to North gradient.

AB  - As mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in natural forest ecosystems. A great number of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) have been isolated from leaves of forest trees, and some metabolites are also isolated and characterized from the FEFs. These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth. In the review, we provide an overview of the ecological roles of FEFs and hope the resources of FEFs can be developed and be used in forestry and agriculture to reduce use of insectcides and fungicides and in pharmacology to maintain human health.

AB  - The effects of restorative grazing on species composition and community structure of butterflies and moths were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands differing in their management history: (1) old continuously grazed pastures, (2) restored pastures with similar to5 yr of reinitiated grazing, and (3) abandoned former pastures. Butterflies and moths were counted with a transect method during 1999 and 2000 in 33 study sites in southwest Finland. In a multivariate ordination (NMDS), the studied grasslands were separated from each other on the basis of their species composition so that the actively grazed pastures differed from abandoned pastures. The first ordination, axis represented most (73%) of the variation in species composition, and it was strongly correlated with variables describing the current grazing intensity. Species richness and total abundance were highest in abandoned pastures, both for all species and for grassland-preferring species. In contrast, relative diversity (N-1, N-2, and alpha) and evenness (Alatalo's evenness index) were in most cases highest in old pastures and lowest in abandoned pastures. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed for four response variables: total species richness, grassland species richness, abundance of all species, and abundance of grassland species. The derived models explained 78-84% of the total variation for species richness and 92-93% for abundance, and the type of grazing history explained the largest proportion of variation. Mean vegetation height was included in the abundance models as a quadratic function, which indicated that butterflies and moths were most abundant at an intermediate level of grazing intensity, as predicted by the "dynamic equilibrium model." The results suggest that grazing management is a useful tool in the restoration of insect communities of abandoned semi-natural grasslands. In order to enhance the survival of species suffering from continuously high grazing intensity, the existing management instructions should be developed toward construction of regional networks of semi-natural grasslands, which would allow differing grazing intensities or rotational grazing on the patch level, but simultaneously ensure continuity of varying management regimes on a regional level.

AB  - Forest management is widely considered to have an impact on the understorey plant diversity, which is essential for sustainable forestry and nature conservation. However, contradictions among previous large-scale studies and meta-analyses raised the need for better-designed research. Such research should identify drivers controlling diversity and species composition, quantify the overstorey-understorey relationships and their dynamics in the temperate forests.
   Two spatial scales (2.25 m(2); 314 m(2)) and stratified random sampling design were used to record under storey vegetation and overstorey and environmental properties along the whole lifecycle of managed Norway spruce (108 years) and European beech (140 years) stands, the most wide-spread mountain forest types in European temperate zone. The dataset also includes primeval fir-beech forests located in the same area.
   Forest management significantly altered understorey diversity and species composition in both beech and spruce stands. Diversity measures changed considerably over the development of managed stands, exhibiting the rapid decline from species-rich forest clearings to poor stands of 30-40 years, later slowly recovering and reaching the average level of old-growth forests at the age of over 100 years. The impact of management was stronger at the smaller scale. It is caused by the fine-scale character of overstorey-understorey interactions, and it is weakened due to stand structure heterogeneity in larger scales.
   Competition of overstorey trees was identified as the most important driver of understorey diversity and its temporal dynamics. It was also reflected in the litter amount, which negatively affected diversity especially in the beech forests. In contrast, the light amount was a more important factor in the spruce stands.
   We conclude that comparisons between datasets that are heterogeneous regarding overstorey age and proportion of development stages, as well as meta-analyses based on such inconsistent studies, can lead to confusing conclusions and improper applications. As a practical implementation, we recommend using overstorey tree density as the most efficient measure for assessment, prediction and managing understorey plant diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rural tourism, especially through second-home development is increasing rapidly in much of Europe, the USA and Canada offering new economic opportunities for local communities, but also challenges related to environmental impacts and differing perceptions within communities about appropriate development paths. This study examines associations between the environmental attitudes of residents and attitudes towards second-home development in two regions in Southern Norway, with community attachment and economic dependency as additional predictors. Ecocentrism was found to have a strong negative effect on attitudes towards tourism development, while, in contrast to previous findings, community attachment did not have significant effects. Economic dependency is significantly related to attitudes towards development; both ecocentrism and economic dependency are mediated by other variables, such as expected impacts and benefits. The findings are important in planning to reduce potential conflicts.

AB  - It is a challenging task to get tourists involved in tourism planning. In addition, it is often believed that local authorities and tourism companies have an adequate understanding of what tourists prefer or need and how local people's interests can be integrated in tourism planning. Regardless, the tourism business is simply dependent on tourists - whether they want to come to a resort again or not. This article examines how the method of internet-based public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) serves in gathering tourists' and locals' views about their favourite places at the Levi tourism resort in northern Finland. By using the PPGIS method it was not only possible to find clusters of favourite places, but also several single places of interest. The study revealed technical challenges in using PPGIS software. The quality and usability of the information and the method are discussed in relation to tourism planning.

AB  - Storm events resulting in windthrows, bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreaks and subsequent forestry operations are the main disturbance agents in European mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests. In the 1990s, a bark beetle outbreak resulted in a large-scale dieback of semi-natural mountain spruce forests in the Sumava National Park, Czech Republic. Two applied management measures enabled long-term monitoring of the effect of natural and anthropogenic disturbance on forest recovery: core zones were left without intervention, and surrounding zones were clear-cut, trees removed, and cleared areas replanted. Research plots were established in three disturbance types: climatically conditioned spruce forest with dead canopy, without intervention (1), with intervention (2), and waterlogged spruce forest partly resistant to bark beetle disturbance without intervention (3). The amount and vertical structure of tree regeneration and vegetation changes have been studied since the beginning of the disturbance in 1997.
   The main question of the study was whether tree regeneration and herb-layer vegetation differed between naturally developing disturbed forests and clearcuts 15 years after the disturbance. The species composition of regeneration in all disturbance types consisted mainly of spruce, with accompanying rowan. The total numbers after 15 years since the beginning of the disturbance did not differ significantly among the studied disturbance types, and were sufficient to replace the previous canopy. However, in clearcuts, these numbers were achieved by artificial reforestation, which was applied after initial destruction of natural regeneration due to salvage operations, whereas advance natural regeneration grew successfully under the protection of unmanaged dead canopy. There was a more unified height structure of spruce regeneration in the clearcuts, with significantly higher numbers of saplings taller than 2 m compared to unmanaged forests. Due to a less harsh change in site conditions, typical herb species flourished in the non-intervention zones in comparison to the clearcuts. The impact of post-disturbance interventions on herb-layer vegetation was still obvious 15 years after the event. Therefore, a non-interventional approach is recommended as the best for restoration of mountain Norway spruce forests affected by large-scale natural disturbances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We have investigated public preferences for use intensity and visual quality of forest recreational infrastructure. Forest infrastructure covers five classes, along a continuum from unmarked paths to paved walkways. Altogether, 39 sites were categorized into the five classes and measured with automatic counters. A sample of 545 respondents living in southeastern and middle Norway were asked to rate 15 forest scenes and 35 preconceptions of recreational settings. The path scenarios were depicted as digitally calibrated photos that systematically displayed physical path feature in boreal, semi-natural settings. Survey participants showed a clearly greater preference for photos and preconceptions of forests settings containing minor elements of forest infrastructure; unmarked paths received the highest score and forest roads/walkways/bikeways the lowest. We identified a clear mismatch between public preferences for forest infrastructure and the intensity of use; the less appreciated infrastructure was the most used. Planning and management has to consider these different needs for recreational infrastructure, and we propose an area zoning system that meets the different segments of forest visitors.

AB  - This study provides first insights into the moss-dwelling meio-invertebrate community inhabiting mosses collected from underwater, splash-water and adjacent terrestrial habitats along a Swedish lake. Additionally, changes in both species and functional diversity of the nematode community were followed. Total meio-invertebrate mean densities and biomass peaked at 10 644.2 +/- 2391.8 individuals (g dry weight (DW) moss)-1 and 14199.3 +/- 5037.3 mu g DW (g DW moss)-1 underwater, 1 m away from the shoreline, where the community was strongly dominated by rotifers, followed by nematodes. Total invertebrate biomass in terrestrial mosses was much lower, indicative of a significantly higher carrying capacity of moss patches in aquatic environments, which provide a high level of resource turnover as well as a buffer against desiccation and extreme temperature fluctuations. We found a total of 74 nematode species and maximum diversity was attained 1 m away from the shoreline and at the splash-water zone. The underwater mosses at the shoreline thus housed the most diverse and abundant assemblages of meio-invertebrates, suggesting they may play an important ecological role at the land-water interface. Evidenced by the multiple shifts in dominance, our study clearly showed that feeding types differed between habitats. The taxonomic and functional segregation of the nematode community along the ecotone further indicated that the composition of nematode species assemblages has the potential to mirror the ecological changes of the study site, even at small scales.

AB  - Norwegian agriculture has, as in most western-European Countries, gone through several periods of change during the last 100 years. Pronounced changes have occurred in production systems and the spatial organisation of farm land, as well as agricultural policy. During the last 50 years, official statistics document a marked decline in the number of active farms. This decline has caused concern, as Norway traditionally has had an agricultural policy that emphasises self-sufficiency and rural settlement. Yet statistics also show that the amount of agricultural land in use has remained the same. This is usually explained through a larger proportion of tenanted land, as technological progress has allowed production levels to be maintained with a smaller workforce. Studies elsewhere in Europe show, however, that tenancy may not promote the same levels of investment and landscape management as owner occupation.
   To assess the potential impact of this change on Norway's landscape (and its value as both a cultural and tourism resource) we analyse tenancy patterns in Norwegian agriculture between 1999 and 2003. In particular we note that, even if owner occupation remains strong nationally, when the statistics are broken down by municipality, tenancy has increased significantly in some areas. This has left large areas of land managed as tenancies by a relatively small number of farmers, including parts of the iconic west coast fjords. We conclude therefore that further work is urgently required to establish whether the effects of tenancy seen elsewhere apply to Norway, whether this exposes key landscapes to increased risk of abandonment and if so what appropriate political responses there could be.

AB  - We studied the effects of tillage and straw management on soil aggregation and soil carbon sequestration in a 30-year split-plot experiment on clay soil in southern Finland. The experimental plots were under conventional or reduced tillage with straw retained, removed or burnt. Wet sieving was done to study organic carbon and soil composition divided in four fractions: 1) large macroaggregates, 2) small macroaggregates, 3) microaggregates and 4) silt and clay. To further estimate the stability of carbon in the soil, coarse particulate organic matter, microaggregates and silt and clay were isolated from the macroaggregates. Total carbon stock in the topsoil (equivalent to 200 kg m(-2)) was slightly lower under reduced tillage (5.0 kg m(-2)) than under conventional tillage (5.2 kg m(-2)). Reduced tillage changed the soil composition by increasing the percentage of macroaggregates and decreasing the percentage of microaggregates. There was no evidence of differences in the composition of the macroaggregates or carbon content in the macroaggregate-occluded fractions. However, due to the higher total amount of macroaggregates in the soil, more carbon was bound to the macroaggregate-occluded microaggregates in reduced tillage. Compared with plowed soil, the density of deep burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) was considerably higher under reduced tillage and positively associated with the percentage of large macroaggregates. The total amount of microbial biomass carbon did not differ between the treatments. Straw management did not have discernible effects either on soil aggregation or soil carbon stock. We conclude that although reduced tillage can improve clay soil structure, generally the chances to increase topsoil carbon sequestration by reduced tillage or straw management practices appear limited in cereal monoculture systems of the boreal region. This may be related to the already high C content of soils, the precipitation level favoring decomposition and aggregate turnover in the winter with topsoil frost. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogeomorphological and ecological succession following a disturbance or the exposure of new ground often proceeds in stages, from domination by abiotic, geophysical factors through stages characterized by increasing effects of biota, biotic-abiotic feedbacks, and eventual domination by ecological processes. However, some studies in forest settings have found more varied development patterns, including persistence of states dominated by biogeomorphic feedbacks. In this study we investigated this phenomenon In Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated forests on the main ridge of the & Scaron;umava Mountains in the Czech Republic along the German and Austrian borders. Throughout most of the Holocene, Picea has strongly influenced microtopography and soil/regolith characteristics so as to inhibit hydrological connectivity and development of surface drainage, and maintain hydromorphic soil conditions. These strongly historically and geographically contingent ecosystem engineering effects create and maintain habitat that favors spruce over other trees. These interactions have maintained a landscape dominated by biogeomorphic feedbacks.

AB  - National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are becoming increasingly important worldwide in order to provide information about the multiple functions of forests, e. g. their provision of raw materials to industry, biodiversity and their capacity to store carbon for mitigating climate change. In several countries the history of NFIs is very long. For these countries a specific challenge is to keep the inventories up-to-date without sacrificing the advantages associated with long time series. At the turn of the 20th century European NFIs faced some major challenges. In this article we describe the history and the recent developments of the Swedish NFI as an example from which general observations are made and discussed. The Swedish NFI started in 1923 and has evolved from an inventory with a narrow focus on wood resources to an inventory today which aims to provide information about all major forest ecosystem services. It can be concluded that the traditional approaches of most European NFIs, e.g. to collect data through sample plot field inventories, has proved to be applicable even for a wide range of new information requirements. Specifically, detailed data about land use, trees, vegetation, and soils has found new important uses in connection with biodiversity assessments and the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. Though time-consuming and difficult, making NFI information comparable across countries through harmonization appears to be a useful approach. The European National Forest Inventory Network (ENFIN) was formed in 2003 and has been successful in pan-European NFI harmonization.

AB  - Isozyme analysis was applied to deter-mine the genetic structure of 14 Norway spruce populations from Slovakia. Gene diversity as well as observed heterozygosity proved to be comparatively high. No essential differences were found between virgin forests and naturally regenerated stands. On the other hand, the genetic variation in artificially established stands proved generally to be decreased. The changed genetic structure is reflected also by large values of genetic distances of these stands from all remaining populations as well as from each other.

AB  - Tree genetic diversity is among the most important factors determining the sustainability of forest ecosystems. The main aim of the present study was to track possible changes in genetic diversity of regenerating populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in areas subjected either to a natural disturbance (windthrows and subsequent clear-cutting of the affected spruce stand) or to a changed land-use legacy (pine regeneration on abandoned agricultural land) with the aim of testing whether the new forest generation retains the genetic diversity of the putative maternal stand. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to reveal the genetic diversity and its spatial distribution in the studied tree populations. Self-regenerating juveniles of Norway spruce and Scots pine were spatially random and as genetically diverse as in the putative maternal populations. Genetic differentiation between putatively maternal trees and regenerating juveniles was low for both species. A high genetic diversity and random spatial genetic structure revealed in the regenerating populations provides a basis for the formation of evolutionary and ecologically sound stands able to adapt to ever-changing climatic conditions. Information on the genetic dynamics of the studied natural populations of long-lived coniferous tree species may be important for evaluating possible changes in genetic diversity at a local scale following forest ecosystem disturbances and changes in land-use legacies.

AB  - The importance of local forests as places of recreation and human well-being depends very much on their visual impact on human perception. Forest managers, therefore, seek to achieve structural elements or attributes that can be used to enhance the visual aesthetics of managed forest ecosystems. The following survey was undertaken in the Tharandter Forest in Saxony (Germany). The field interviews were focussed on visual aesthetics and acceptance. The statements of the 53 participants in the survey were used to analyse views concerning typical Norway spruce forest types: with the regeneration of deciduous tree species in the background, without regeneration, and with European beech as a second layer in the foreground. The evaluation of the questionnaires confirmed a clear ranking. The forest view with the regeneration of deciduous tree species received the highest number of positive scores, followed by the forest view with beech as a second layer. The forest view characterised by pure and dense Norway spruce trees received the worst rating, differing significantly from the other two, on the basis of the spatial arrangement, visual diversity and acceptance. Linear mixed models demonstrated that visual aesthetics was mostly explained by visual diversity as a result of tree species diversity or mixtures and age structures, the diversity of surrounding structures and colours, ground vegetation or visibility.

AB  - Ponds are key elements for ecosystem functions in urban areas. However, little is known about pond biodiversity changes over time and the drivers underlying such changes. Here, we tested whether past species assemblages, land cover and pond environmental change influence pond macroinvertebrate species richness and temporal beta diversity. We also compared spatial and temporal beta diversity, and investigated species-specific colonization and extinction rates over time. We sampled for presence of Odonata and Trichoptera (larvae), and Coleoptera and Hemiptera (larvae and adults) species in 30 ponds in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2014 and 2019. Past species richness was the best predictor of current species richness, whereas temporal changes in land cover and pond environment were not significantly related to current species richness. No correlations between temporal beta diversity and land cover or pond environmental changes were detected. However, ponds showed large changes in their temporal beta diversity, with equal contributions from species gains and losses. The probability of species colonizing and going extinct from ponds revealed that more common species were more likely to colonize a pond, while uncommon species were more likely to go extinct in a pond. Within our 5-year study, we found (i) highly similar spatial and temporal beta diversity, (ii) that past species richness is a good predictor of current species richness; however, the same does not hold true for species composition. The high dynamics of urban pond communities suggest that a large number of ponds are required to maintain high species richness at a landscape level.

CP  - 5th International Symposium on Earthworm Ecology (ISEE 5)
AB  - We have determined and assessed the earthworm population community structure under different selected microecosystems (i.e. forest ecosystem and herbaceous ecosystem). Samples of earthworms and soil were studied from four sites in Lafayette Forest Experimental Station, State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry. These sites are the Northern Hardwood forest, Tamarack plantation, Norway spruce and Old Field Herbaceous. They represent temperate woody (forest) vegetation cover and herbaceous ecosystems. Samples were collected from summer 1984 through early summer of 1985. The comparative study of temperate earthworm populations under these sites showed that the optimal physico-chemical soil environment for earthworms includes a 20-35% soil water content, a soil pH of 5.8-6.2 and soil E-h of 510-640 mV. Application of diversity and similarity indices showed that diversity of earthworm populations increases with increased species numbers. At the same time, there is a negative correlation between diversity and population density (ind./species) in CSD (Community Structure Diversity) scale that explains the sensitivity of CSD index toward the rare species. Similarity indices showed that earthworm populations of similar vegetative cover ar: very similar. Earthworm communities exhibit the lowest similarity between the coldest and hottest seasons in all habitats studied. Also, there is a similarity between consecutive seasons in the different habitats. It was found also that spring and summer seasons are the most important seasons for the increase in Aporrectodea earthworm species in central New York. Aporrectodea tuberculata and Octalasion tyrtaeum are the numerically dominant species, while the dominant genus of juvenile earthworms is Lumbricus spp. (J) based upon the ISA index (Roberts and Hsi, 1979). There was a significant association between anecique and epigeic species and between epigeic and endogetic species. This shows that earthworms depend on the type of dominant vegetative cover in the site. Finally, the litter composition is the factor that affects earthworm abundance and biomass on the sites.

AB  - Finfish farming is the most common aquaculture mode in Europe. In Norway, the industry faces sustainability challenges. One major challenge is fish escape, which is a threat to both the environment and the industry's reputation. The more complex the operation, the greater the risk of escape, and their safety management needs improvement. A recommended strategy is to implement a safety indicator programme to monitor the risk levels before, during, and after an operation. The main objective of this study is to identify risk influencing factors (RIFs) and develop safety indicators for fish farm operations based on accident reports, using a qualitative graphical network to visualise and systematise causal chains. We have used a six-step methodology to develop safety indicators that can be applied to the case of fish escape: 1) The study was limited to fish escape accidents caused by the hazardous events hole in the net and submerged net. 2) Operations of high risk were identified, and chains of events were established, starting with these operations and ending with the accident (fish escape), based on fish escape report data and accident analyses. 3) A qualitative Bayesian network (BN) was drawn to specify the influence between the contributing causes and conditions in the causal chains. 4) RIFs were identified based on the BN (seven environmental, four organisational, eight operational, and 12 technical). 5) Safety indicators were developed to measure the condition of the RIFs. Update frequency of indicators, methods of measurement, and recommended states were also suggested. 6) The safety indicators were evaluated according to the chosen quality criteria. Based on the resulting list of safety indicators, we suggest a safety indicator programme for the operation fish crowding. The causal chains, RIFs, and safety indicators can also be used as a supplement in internal audits and quality improvement work, development of preventive measures, and training of fish farm personnel.

AB  - This study looks into the role of participation in influencing the adaptation of national policies to generate local economic development opportunities. The main question put forward is: What are the preconditions for creating new local development opportunities in a national state's government planning process? The subject of the study is a planning process for the designation of a national park in the southwestern part of Norway. The analysis looks into three factors from the perspective of power: the mobilization and power base development of local stakeholders, the planning authority's intention and structure for participation and change, and how conflicts are handled in the dialogue arenas. The conclusion with respect to regional innovation literature is that local stakeholders could make a difference by articulating both power over and power with and that conflicts may be useful if the planning authority takes the participants' claims seriously by showing compromise or allowing integration of interests. From such preconditions new local economic opportunities could be created by collaboration.

AB  - Bottom trawling alters the abundance, diversity, size-composition, and function of benthic communities. However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can 'disentangle' trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1-4 mm) and large ( > 4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting is a coherent framework for integrating measures of ecosystems and the flow of services they provide to the national accounting of economic activity. Here we focus on the accounting of cultural ecosystem services, particularly, nature-based recreation in open access conditions in Finland. The aim is to improve national capacity to proceed to ecosystem accounting by illustrating possibilities in existing data and knowledge and by identifying data gaps. We apply the United Nations System of Integrated Environmental Accounting - Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA EEA) framework for recreation accounting to test its applicability, and to show how existing national forest and outdoor recreation-related data sets can support accounting. Assessment of the extent of recreational resources is based on data from areas available for recreation. In the assessment of recreational use, we illustrate how nationwide survey data can provide an estimate of the number of recreational visits to nature areas and a solid base for monetary accounts. We identify gaps in the extent, supply and use data for recreational ecosystem services.

AB  - As one of the most abundant tree species in the hemiboreal zone, birch is important from both commercial and biodiversity perspectives. While old-growth deciduous stands are important for biodiversity conservation with an emphasis on deadwood availability, the role that deadwood in these stands plays in carbon sequestration remains unclear. We studied mature (71-110 years old) and old-growth (121-150 years old) birch stands on fertile mineral soils. The marginal mean deadwood volume was 43.5 +/- 6.4 m(3)ha(-1)in all mature stands, 51.3 +/- 7.1 m(3)ha(-1)in recently unmanaged mature stands, and 54.4 +/- 4.4 m(3)ha(-1)in old-growth stands; the marginal mean deadwood carbon pool for each stand type was 5.4 +/- 0.8 t.ha(-1), 6.3 +/- 0.9 t.ha(-1), and 7.9 +/- 0.6 t.ha(-1), respectively. Deadwood volume was not related to stand productivity in terms of stand basal area, stand height, or stand age. The difference between mature and old-growth stands remained non-significant (p< 0.05). A high volume of deadwood was almost continuously present throughout the landscape in assessed unmanaged sites; moreover, 88% of sample plots in old-growth stands and 63% of sample plots in mature stands had a deadwood volume higher than 20 m(3.)ha(-1). Old-growth stands had a slightly greater volume of large deadwood than unmanaged mature stands; in both, almost half of the deadwood was more than 30 cm in diameter and approximately one-fifth had a diameter greater than 40 cm. Both groups of stands had similar proportions of coniferous and deciduous deadwood and lying and standing deadwood. Old-growth stands had a higher volume of recently and weakly decayed wood, indicating increased dieback during recent years.

AB  - Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) is a widespread forest tree species in Central and Northern Europe but with a scattered distribution. In the debate on climate change driven changes in species selection in the forest, Norway maple has recently received raised interest because of its comparatively high drought resistance (higher than in sycamore maple). Therefore, it is an interesting species for sites high in carbonates and where other native tree species have become devastated by pathogens (e.g., elm, ash). In Austria, the demand on saplings is currently rising, while there is only very little domestic reproductive material available (on average more than 95% of saplings are imported from neighboring countries). This study was undertaken to identify genetic diversity and population structure of Norway maple in Austria to lay the foundation for the establishment of respective in situ and ex situ conservation measures. In addition, samples from planted stands and imported reproductive material from other countries were included to study the anthropogenic influence on the species in managed forests. We used 11 novel microsatellites to genotype 756 samples from 27 putatively natural Austrian populations, and 186 samples derived from two planted stands and five lots of forest reproductive material; in addition, 106 samples from other European populations were also genotyped. Cross species amplification of the new markers was tested in 19 Acer species from around the world. Population clustering by STRUCTURE analysis revealed a distinct pattern of population structure in Austria and Europe, but overall moderate differentiation. Sibship analysis identifies several populations with severe founding effects, highlighting the need for proper selection of seed sources of sufficient genetic diversity in the species.

AB  - Intensive fertilization of young spruce forest plantations (i.e. 'nutrient optimization') has the potential to meet increasing demands for carbon sequestration and biomass production from boreal forests. However, its effects on biodiversity, other than the homogenization of ground-layer plant communities, are widely unknown.
   We sampled ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in young spruce forest plantations of southern Sweden, within a large-scale, replicated ecological experiment initiated in 2012, where half of the forest stands were fertilized every second year. We assessed multi-scale effects of forest fertilization on ground beetle diversity and community assembly, 4 years after commencement of the experiment.
   We found that nutrient optimization had negative effects on ground beetle diversity at multiple spatial scales, despite having negligible effects on species richness. At the local scale, ground beetle species had lower variation in body size at fertilized sites, resulting in within-site functional homogenization. At the landscape scale, fertilized sites, with higher basal area and lower bilberry cover, filtered carabid traits composition to larger body sizes, generalist predators and summer breeding species.
   Synthesis and applications. Fertilization of young spruce plantations is a strong filter for ground beetle assemblages, leading to functionally homogeneous communities in the short term, without changes in species richness. The large-scale functional impoverishment of carabid communities because of fertilization may have negative consequences on system resilience and on ecosystem service provision by this functionally diverse group. Large-scale establishment of nutrient optimization threatens ground beetle diversity in young conifer plantations, underlining the risks of introducing more intensive management schemes in already heavily managed forest landscapes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the foliar endophyte biodiversity of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss to establish a baseline for future comparative studies examining the impact of forestry practices. It identifies for the first time endophytic fungi living inside the needles of white spruce from 280 needles collected in seven natural stands in southern Quebec. The endophyte colonization rate on surface sterilized needles was 53.2%. We performed a PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis on the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA to achieve molecular identification. Isolate ITS sequences were compared with data from GenBank presenting the best similarity and were analyzed by a maximum of parsimony and Bayesian inference. Relationships between morphological groups, digestion groups, and sequence groups were investigated. In all, 23 morphotypes were found to belong to 14 sequence groups and we demonstrated that morphological groups are poor indicators for estimating species diversity. This study is the first to establish species richness values for foliar endophytes. Among the 141 isolates in this study, 75.15% have a high sequence similarity with Lophodermium piceae, 10.95% with an unknown species of Mycosphaerella, and 5.5% with two species of the genus Hypoxylon. Distribution, incidence and biological significance of all the endophytes found in this study are discussed.

AB  - Individual tree architecture and the composition of tree species play a vital role for many ecosystem functions and services provided by a forest, such as timber value, habitat diversity, and ecosystem resilience. However, knowledge is limited when it comes to understanding how tree architecture changes in response to competition. Using 3D-laser scanning data from the German Biodiversity Exploratories, we investigated the detailed three-dimensional architecture of 24 beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees that grew under different levels of competition pressure. We created detailed quantitative structure models (QSMs) for all study trees to describe their branching architecture. Furthermore, structural complexity and architectural self-similarity were measured using the box-dimension approach from fractal analysis. Relating these measures to the strength of competition, the trees are exposed to reveal strong responses for a wide range of tree architectural measures indicating that competition strongly changes the branching architecture of trees. The strongest response to competition (rho = -0.78) was observed for a new measure introduced here, the intercept of the regression used to determine the box-dimension. This measure was discovered as an integrating descriptor of the size of the complexity-bearing part of the tree, namely the crown, and proven to be even more sensitive to competition than the box-dimension itself. Future studies may use fractal analysis to investigate and quantify the response of tree individuals to competition.

AB  - The tree species composition, vertical stratification and patterns of spatial autocorrelation at the tree and quadrate (25 x 25 m) scales were studied in a natural mature Pinus sylvestris dominated forest in eastern Finland. For the analyses we mapped the locations and dimensions of trees taller than 10 m in a 9 ha (300 x 300 m) area, and within this area we mapped all trees taller than 0.3 m on a core plot of 4 ha (200 x 200 rr.). The overall tree size distribution was bimodal, the dominant layer and the understory forming the peak frequencies. Pinus sylvestris dominated the main canopy, together with scattered Betula pendula and Picea abies. Alnus incana, Populus tremula, Salix caprea, Sorbus aucuparia and Juniperus comnumis occurred only in the under-and middlestories. Autocorrelation analysis (semivariance) of tree size variation revealed spatial patterns, which were strongly dependent on the size of trees included in the analysis. When all living trees, including the understory regeneration, were taken into account, the autocorrelation pattern ranged up to 35 m inter-tree distances, reflecting the spatial scale of understory regeneration patches. Competitive interaction among middle- and upperstory trees (height >10 m) had contrasting effects on autocorrelation pattern depending on spatial scale. At the fine scale, dominant trees suppressed their smaller close neighbors (asymmetric competition), which was shown as increased tree size variation at small inter-tree distances (<2 m). At slightly larger inter-tree distances, specifically among large trees of similar size, competition was more symmetrical, which resulted in decreased tree size variation at these inter-tree distances (3-4 m). This effect was seen most clearly in the dominant trees, there being a clear autocorrelation pattern in tree size up to inter-tree distances of approximate to 4 m. Al the quadrate scale (25 x 25 m) the analysis revealed high local variation in structural characteristics such as tree height diversity (THD), tree species diversity (H') and autocorrelation of tree height. The analysis suggests that naturally developed P. sylvestris forests exhibit complex small-scale patterns of structural heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation in tree size. These patterns may be important for stand-scale habitat diversity and can have aggregated effects on ecosystem dynamics at larger spatial scales though their influence on the spread of disturbance and regeneration after disturbance.

AB  - Huge amounts of hydrocarbons are leaking into the oceans and into air. Methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. Even though the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere is limited to roughly 7 years there are constant sources of additional methane. Some of these sources are natural gas hydrates that dissociate through inflow of seawater. Other sources of methane fluxes are also controlled by hydrate when the seafloor conditions are inside hydrate formation conditions of temperature and pressure. In this work we propose a new concept which ad-dresses three environmental concerns. Injection of CO2 dominated gas in hydrate filled sediments, and into sediments controlling leakage from conventional sources into seafloor at hydrate forming conditions will contribute in sealing these leakage sources. This can substantially reduce worldwide leakage fluxes of hydro-carbons to the oceans and to air. A critical element of the approach is a thermodynamic analysis that ensures that the injection gas dominates hydrate formation at local sediment conditions. The associated carbon dioxide storage, and related reduction in leakage fluxes of hydrocarbons are two environmental benefits. A third benefit can be gained by adding steam conversion of the hydrocarbons to hydrogen and carbon dioxide (for re-injection). The concept is discussed using geoscience data from the Black Sea and from Nyegga area offshore Norway. We conclude that between 3.4 and 4 mol of hydrogen gas can be produced for every mole of carbon dioxide stored safely in these two regions.

AB  - We explored the usefulness of three satellite land cover data sets available to land managers in south-central Sweden for conservation planning using four deciduous forest focal resident bird species with different habitat requirements. Habitat suitability models using empirical species-specific habitat parameters and a Geographic Information System were applied to evaluate and compare the degree of consistency among three different land cover data sets. The study area encompassed 10,000 km(2) in a landscape mosaic of managed boreal forests and is within the distribution range of all four focal species. Although the three land cover data sets indicated similar total amounts of deciduous forest, the habitat suitability models showed that different land cover data yielded inconsistent results regarding the amount and distribution of suitable habitat within 5x5 km grid cells. Given this sensitivity to the choice of land cover data sets, the habitat suitability models showed positive relationships among the selected focal species for each land cover data set separately. As expected, decreasing amounts of suitable habitat were identified for species with higher specialisation. Thus, because habitat suitability models are an appropriate way to gain insight into the functionality and connectivity of habitat networks, land cover data must be carefully evaluated and if necessary combined with other landscape information for effective conservation planning.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment scheme that should help local conservation management in their adaptation to potential effects of climate change. It can be used for the identification of robust adaptation options at site level. The assessment scheme was applied to the management of Europe's largest population of wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) living in the arctic-alpine plateau of Hardangervidda in south-western Norway. At first, the last four decades (1964-2004) were analysed to identify climate- and non-climate-related driving forces affecting the population. In addition, regional projections of climate change were used to build scenarios for the potential effects on these driving forces until 2050. In the second step, the potential effects of climate change were classified according to the risk they pose to the conservation of reindeer in Hardangervidda. Based on this assessment, no-regret strategies for biodiversity management under changing climate conditions could be identified.

AB  - In natural forests, fire is an important disturbance factor and many studies have been carried out concerning its effect on different ecosystems, but no studies have previously been done considering the scuttle flies in hemiboreal forests. Here, we carried out an ecological investigation of the scuttle fly assemblage in a hemiboreal old-growth forest in Tyresta National Park and Nature Reserve (Sweden) from material collected, using Malaise traps, after wildfires in 1997 and 1999. We evaluated abundances of species, dominance structure, species richness (by non-parametric species richness method - Chao 1) as well as phenology. The most abundant species of the dominant group (i.e. Megaselia pleuralis, M. nigriceps, M. pulicaria-complex and M. brevicostalis) are multivoltine and saprophagous, displaying spring and late summer/autumn activity.

AB  - This meta-analysis aims to identify the key factors governing the economic costs of avoided deforestation in developing countries. To this end, data were collected from 32 primary studies published between 1995 and 2012, yielding 277 observations. Results show that unit costs depend significantly on cost features like estimation methodology, inclusion or exclusion of cost components, carbon accounting method, area size, alternative land uses and beneficiaries, time horizon, and the continent in which the forest protection scheme is implemented, but also factors like the share of agriculture in a nation's economy play a significant role in explaining unit costs. In future studies, greater attention needs to be paid to additional cost components like transaction costs and the presence of the co-benefits of avoided deforestation.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in soil functions that are crucial for sustainable agriculture. Understanding how agricultural management and soil properties affect SOM in different soil depths would aid in maintaining and increasing SOM throughout the soil profile. We sampled a 24 year-old cultivation field experiment with organic and conventional cropping systems, and an adjacent unmanaged meadow to 70 cm soil depth to assess the total organic carbon (OC) stocks and the distribution of OC into mineral-associated (MAOM), particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) organic matter. We found that >83% of the soil OC was in the MAOM fraction, and that the distribution of OC across the MAOM, POM and DOM within a soil depth was not strongly affected by soil management. Largest OC stocks (169 t ha- 1) together with the largest plant root biomass was found in the unmanaged meadow, which highlights the potential of deep-rooting plants in sequestering OC into the soil. The OC saturation state of the soil was assessed based on the clay to OC ratio and Hassink's Equation (Hassink 1997). Hassink's Equation seemed to underestimate the MAOM accrual capacity of these soils and thus overestimated soil OC saturation state, whereas the clay to OC ratio indicated potential for OC accrual in all soil depths except for the meadow topsoil. These varying results suggest that the applied metric should be soil type and -depth specific. We also determined the contribution of clay content and aluminum and iron oxides in explaining the amount of total OC, MAOM-C and POM-C. In contrast to the aluminum and iron oxides, clay was not well correlated to any of the OC fractions below the 20 cm depth, suggesting that estimating the OC accrual potential of the deeper soil should not be based on the soil texture alone. Our results indicate that aluminum and iron oxides can play an important role in transporting and stabilizing of OC in the soil profile.

AB  - Stump extraction (which include removal of coarse roots) will reduce the available habitat for insects breeding in dead wood (saproxylic species). The root-living diversity is largely unknown which is unsatisfactory as 68% of the wood harvested at stump extraction is root wood. We compared the diversity of saproxylic beetles in Norway spruce, Picea abies, coarse roots with that in the above-ground part of the same stumps. Five below-ground (root) and eight above-ground (stump) samples were collected from early-decay stumps at each of twelve Swedish clear-cuts. In total 8314 saproxylic beetles of 60 species were reared from the 156 wood samples. The estimated species richness in roots (47 species) was 51% of that in stumps (93). When root and stump samples were pooled the total estimate was 116 species. The phylogenetic diversity (average taxonomic distinctness) in individual roots was only 63% of that in stumps. Species composition differed between substrate types, and only 28% of the species were common to both substrates. Most root samples were numerically dominated by Dryocoetes autographus (33% of the samples) or Hylobius abietis (10%). Most stump samples were dominated by Crypturgus spp. (66%) or Rhagium inquisitor (19%). Of the 17 most abundant species, five were associated with roots and two of those used roots exclusively. Ten species were associated with stumps. We conclude that the root living beetles constitute an important part of the stump/root assemblage and should not be overlooked when the effects of stump harvest on biodiversity is evaluated.

AB  - There is a strong trend toward reforestation of abandoned grasslands in alpine regions which may impact the carbon balance of alpine ecosystems. Here, we studied the effects of afforestation with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) on an extensively grazed subalpine pasture in Switzerland on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling and storage. Along a 120-year long chronosequence with spruce stands of 25, 30, 40, 45, and > 120 years and adjacent pastures, we measured tree biomass, SOC stocks down to the bedrock, natural C-13 abundances, and litter quality. To unravel controls on SOC cycling, we have monitored microclimatic conditions and quantified SOC decomposability under standardized conditions as well as soil respiration in situ. Stocks of SOC were only moderately affected by the afforestation: in the mineral soil, SOC stocks transiently decreased after tree establishment, reaching a minimum 40-45 years after afforestation (-25 %) and increased thereafter. Soils of the mature spruce forest stored the largest amount of SOC, 13 % more than the pasture soils, mainly due to the accumulation of an organic layer (23 t C ha(-1)). By comparison, C accumulated in the tree biomass exceeded the SOC pool by a factor of three in the old forest. In contrast to the small impact on C storage, afforestation strongly influenced the composition and quality of the soil organic matter (SOM). With increasing stand age, delta C-13 values of the SOM became consistently more positive, which can be interpreted as a gradual replacement of grass- by spruce-derived C. Fine roots of spruce were enriched in C-13, in lignin and had a higher C/N ratio in comparison to grass roots. As a consequence, SOM quality as indicated by the lower fraction of readily decomposable (labile) SOM and higher C:N ratios declined after the land-use change. Furthermore, spruce plantation induced a less favorable microclimate for microbial activity with the average soil temperature during the growing season being 5 A degrees C lower in the spruce stands than in the pasture. In situ soil respiration was approximately 50 % lower after the land use conversion, which we primarily attribute to the colder conditions and the lower SOM quality, but also to drier soils (-25 %) and to a decreased fine root biomass (-40 %). In summary, afforestation on subalpine pastures only moderately affected SOC storage as compared to the large C sink in tree biomass. In contrast, SOC cycling rates strongly decreased as a result of a less favorable microclimate for decomposition of SOM, a lower C input by roots, and a lower litter quality.

AB  - The occurrence of vascular plants was surveyed on 207 islands (size range 0.01-390.2 ha, number of plant species 1-449) offshore from the city of Helsinki in the Baltic Sea to examine the conservation value of these islands. We calculated a rarity score for each species (1/number of islands occupied by the species) and a biodiversity score for each island (sum of the rarity scores of each species present on the island). Positive correlations between species number and biodiversity score (r(s) = 0.97, p < 0.001) and between biodiversity score and island area (r(s) = 0.87, p < 0.001) indicated that these parameters are heavily dependent on island size. With the goal of including at least one occurrence (island) of all plant species, an iterative selection algorithm chose a set of 41 islands whose average size (29.3 ha) was four times the average size of all existing islands (7.0 ha). Strong nestedness (N < 54) explains the concentration of plant species diversity on large islands. An operational strategy for selection of sites for protection is to complement the set produced by a selection algorithm with target species not yet included (e.g., endangered species with several occurrences). Comprehensive mapping and analysis of a taxonomic group will help integrate conservation biology into land-use planning and increase the quality of the networks of protected areas.

AB  - The study aimed at developing an agro-biodiversity indicator based on trophic interactions between 25 common arable weeds and individual groups of farmland birds, pollinators (wild bees), phytophagous insects and insect pests. Each weed species was weighted based on the number of reported linkages with each animal group. Four biodiversity indices based on these weights were constructed and applied to exploring the ecological consequences of long-term changes in weed populations in Finland. Data were used from weed surveys of Finnish spring cereal fields conducted in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. The relative importance of weed species varied according to animal groups. Annual weed species able to produce numerous seeds were important for the farmland birds and some perennial weed species were important for the pollinators. The highest number of linkages was established between weed species and phytophagous insects. The number of harmful pest species associated with broad-leaved weeds was low for all species. The general pattern of changes in values of indices over recent decades was similar: there was a marked decline in the values between the 1960s and the 1980s, and a slight increase between the 1980s and the 1990s. These changes were regarded as being a consequence of changes in the intensity of agricultural practices. The slowest recovery of the values was for pollinators. The results suggest that the ecological consequences of changes in the intensity of agriculture can be explored with the aid of a biodiversity indicator based on species interactions. Owing to the differences in the importance of weed species for different animal groups, maintaining weed species richness is necessary to ensure ecosystem services are provided for the higher trophic levels in farmland.

AB  - This study employs chemical fractionations of sedimentary metals and analyses of sediment arcellacean (thecamoebian) faunas to study the ecological effects of mining wastewaters in a boreal lake bay that receives metal-rich waters from a Cu mine. Sediment chemistry and arcellacean species compositions were analyzed from both surface sediment samples and a sediment profile to investigate spatial and temporal changes in mine water pollution and biota. Based on the results, geochemical gradients in the area are caused by dispersal and dilution of metal-rich, low-pH mine waters entering the lake; transport and focusing of fine grained metal precipitates and sulphate in the deep areas of the bay; increase in pH due to sulphate reduction and mobilization of redox-sensitive elements from deep water sites; and precipitation of the mobilized metals at shallower sites. Arcellacean species compositions change systematically with increasing distance from the source of pollution and species diversity as well as concentrations of tests in the samples increase as well. Fe:Mn ratio and adsorbed Al explained variation in surface sediment arcellaceans with statistical significance. Fe:Mn ratio is an indicator of the overall geochemical environment (Eh, pH), while the toxicity of Al in aquatic environments is well known. Changes in arcellacean species and geochemistry in the long core suggest that before the mine closure in 1983, mine waters differed in nature from the present acid drainage and metals such as Cu, Co, Zn and Ni may have affected arcellaceans at that time.

AB  - Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.

AB  - Policies for future conservation of forests must be preceded by an evaluation of the present reserves. Using data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, this study analyses Swedish reserves, i.e. national parks, nature reserves and forest service reserves, in terms of proportion of forest, stand age, site quality, tree species composition and tree volumes. The results show that in Sweden, the proportion of productive forest within reserves is 20% compared to 60% of the non-reserve land area, and that the volume of dead trees is greater in reserves. In general the distribution of forests within reserves is skewed towards old, low:productivity Norway spruce forests in Northwest Sweden. This allocation may not meet the demands for protection of the habitats of endangered species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest stand structure can be described through stand structural parameters as well as using stand structural indices. However, to date, there is still much uncertainty regarding how stand structural indices and parameters are intercorrelated. The analysis of correlation can guide their selection in research applications and forest management, avoiding redundancies and loss of time during data collection. In this study, using a sample of forest stands belonging to three forest types of the southeastern Italian Alps, we explored the correlation among stand structural indices, and then we checked the relationships between stand structural indices and stand structural parameters. The results indicate that the stand structural indices vary among the sampled forest types. Moreover, the correlation among stand structural indices indicates that some of them are strongly intercorrelated and, thus, they can give redundant information. Strong correlations have been found between the Shannon index and the Mingling index, between the Gini index and the Diameter differentiation index, and between size dominance indices. Correlations between stand structural indices and stand structural parameters were weak, and, therefore, we cannot recommend the exclusive use of stand structural indices as alternative to the common stand structural parameters. Instead, the combined use of stand structural indices and parameters can be a robust solution for describing forest stand structure.

TI  - Characterisation of several Connemara Pony populations
T2  - Conservation Genetics of Endangered Horse Breeds
LA  - English
CP  - 55th Annual Meeting of the European-Association-of-Animal-Production
AB  - The Connemara Pony is one of Irelands few indigenous equine breeds. It is a numerically small breed, with approximately 2,000 breeding females and 250 breeding males in Ireland. The Department of Agriculture and Food in Ireland have classified the breed as endangered.
   The results generated from a characterisation of the population in Ireland indicate that past breeding practices have caused a substantial loss in the breeds' genetic diversity. As a consequence of that project a study was undertaken to characterise and compare the genetic diversity of Connemara Pony populations outside Ireland. Included in this study were the Connemara Pony populations of the United Kingdom, France, North America, Sweden, Denmark and Finland respectively.
   Results indicated that, to varying degrees, the level of genetic diversity in the different populations has been in a state of decline. The average inbreeding and relationship coefficient for each reference population ranges from 4.04% and 8.57% in North America, to 4.97% and 19.64% in Finland.
   Of the six countries under study North America was the furthest removed from the Irish Connemara Pony population, with the sires of the North American reference population having the lowest average relationship to the sires (6.64%) and dams (6.64%) of the Irish population. Thus, of all of the countries under study the North America Connemara Pony population represents the most likely source of genetic variation, which could be used to widen the gene pool of the Connemara Pony population in Ireland.

AB  - Background: Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a hereditary disease with a complex genotype-phenotype correlation. We conducted a literature survey to define the clinical landscape of TTR amyloidosis across populations worldwide. Then, we investigated whether the genetically determined TTR expression differs among human populations, contributing to the differences observed in patients. Polygenic scores for genetically determined TTR expression in 14 clinically relevant tissues were constructed using data from the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project and tested in the samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project.
   Results: We observed differences among the ancestral groups and, to a lesser extent, among the investigated populations within the ancestry groups. Scandinavian populations differed in their genetically determined TTR expression of skeletal muscle tissue with respect to Southern Europeans (p = 6.79*10(-6)). This is in line with epidemiological data related to Swedish and Portuguese TTR Val30Met endemic areas. Familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (TTR deposits occur primarily in heart tissues) presents clinical variability among human populations, a finding that agrees with the among-ancestry diversity of genetically determined TTR expression in heart tissues (i.e., Atrial Appendage p = 4.55*10(-28); Left Ventricle p = 6.54*10(-35)).
   Conclusions: Genetically determined TTR expression varied across human populations. This might contribute to the genotype-phenotype correlation of TTR amyloidosis.

AB  - Dense beds of aquatic plants are often perceived as nuisance and therefore mechanically removed, often at substantial cost. Such removal, however, may affect a range of ecosystem functions and consequently also the ecosystem services that benefit society.We studied five cases: River Otra (Norway), River Spree (Germany), Lake Kemnade (Germany), Lake Grand-Lieu (France) and Hartbeespoort Dam (South Africa). In all, nuisance aquatic plant growth is managed, but dominant species, geographic setting and major societal uses are different. We quantified 12 final ecosystem services as flows per area and year in biophysical and monetary terms. Quantified services were food and fodder production, commercial fisheries, hunting and gathering wild products, hydropower production, drinking and irrigation water production, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, active and passive recreation and biodiversity conservation (nonuse).These services were related to aquatic plant cover via a range of ecosystem functions, and the effects were estimated of three plant removal regimes on the relative importance of the quantified ecosystem services and on the total sum of the monetary estimates (total economic value, TEV). The three removal regimes were 'maximum removal', 'current practice' and 'do nothing'.In all five cases, TEV was dominated by different forms of recreation. TEV was highest for Lake Kemnade, where visitor densities were highest. TEV was most sensitive to the different management regimes in Lake Kemnade, because a threshold in aesthetic appreciation was passed in the 'do-nothing' regime, and in Hartbeespoort Dam, because of the effect on boating and angling. In the other cases, the different removal regimes had little effect on the estimated TEV.Synthesis and applications. Since recreation dominated the estimated societal benefits in the studied ecosystems, also where provision of hydropower, drinking water or irrigation water were relevant, effects on recreation should be a core consideration in the management of nuisance aquatic plants. Furthermore, aquatic plant management strategies will benefit from taking into account the differences in perceived nuisance among different categories of recreative users before engaging in costly removal.

AB  - A consensus has been established that functional traits rather than taxonomic diversity playa fundamental role in linking biodiversity with ecosystem processes and associated services. This study from Finland addressed an issue of relative values of fallow and field margin biotopes in conservation of plant functional diversity (based on six functional traits of relevance to ecosystem services, and diversity of multiple traits) in agricultural landscapes differing in their structural complexity. Relative covers of plant species were surveyed in sampling plots located in perennial fallow fields and three types of perennial margins (margins between crop fields, along forest edges and by river) in three types of landscape context (simple, intermediate and complex). Fallow fields significantly contributed to the total functional diversity only in simple landscapes. The river margins provided the greatest functional diversity, especially in reproduction and regeneration traits while crop margins were consistently characterized by the lowest functional diversity. Substantial functional diversity of fallow patches in simple landscapes was due to high abundance of functional species, while that of river margins stemmed from presence of unique species. The plant functional diversity progressively declined with agricultural landscapes becoming simplified. The study indicates non-cropped biotopes having complementary roles in ensuring multifunctionality of agro-landscapes and confirms importance of biotope mosaic for functional diversity.

AB  - In boreal forests, European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species that hosts a variety of accompanying species including epiphytic lichens. Forest management actions have led to a decrease in aspen abundance and subsequent loss of suitable habitats of epiphytic lichens. In this study, we evaluate the environmental responses of epiphytic lichen species richness and community composition on aspen, focusing on the potential of remote sensing by combined hyperspectral imaging and airborne laser scanning to identify suitable habitats for epiphytic lichens. We measured different substrate and habitat parameters in the field (e.g., aspen diameter and bark pH) and by remote sensing (e.g., mean canopy height and tree species composition of the surrounding forest) in the study area in Southern Finland that includes protected and non-protected forest. We used linear regression and the Hierarchical Model of Species Communities (HMSC) to compare how the different parameters explain and predict lichen species richness and community composition, respectively. We show that coarse predictions of epiphytic lichen community composition can be made using parameters extracted from remote sensing data. Estimated mean canopy height, tree density, dominant tree species and tree species diversity of the stand predicted the species community on aspens slightly better than field parameters. Remote sensing variables calculated over a larger area (30 m radius) always outperformed the same variables calculated over a smaller area (10 m radius) in predicting community composition, highlighting the cost-efficiency of remote sensing compared to covering a similar area with on-ground measurements. These results are encouraging for the prospects of using remote sensing data to direct field inventories and to map potential high-biodiversity habitats. Aspen bark pH was the only parameter affecting species richness regardless of whether the forest was protected or not, whereas, interestingly, the effects of tree diameter, height and furrow depth were only significant in protected areas. Our results also underline the importance of protected areas, since they hosted a higher tree-specific number of epiphytic lichen species, and red listed species, than non-protected areas.

AB  - The MAREANO (Marine AREA database for NOrwegian coast and sea areas) mapping programme includes acquisition of multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data together with a comprehensive, integrated biological and geological sampling programme. Equipment used includes underwater video, box corer, grab, epibenthic sled and beam trawl. Habitat maps are produced by combining information on landscapes, landscape elements, sediment types and biological communities. Video observations provide information about the megafauna diversity of large (> 1 cm) epifauna and bottom types, whilst bottom samples describe the composition of epifauna, hyperfauna (crustaceans living in the upper part of the sediment and/or swimming just above the substratum) and infauna, and sediment composition. In this study, two biological data sets are used to study fauna response to environmental heterogeneity at two different spatial scales: (1) broad scale, megahabitat (1-10s km), based on information about megafauna taxa observed during video surveys in the Nordland/Troms area, (2) fine scale, mesohabitat (10s m-1 km), based on information about species composition documented with video records and bottom sampling gear from the bank "Tromsoflaket". In general, the highest diversity is found on bottoms with mixed substrates indicating that substratum heterogeneity is very important for the biodiversity at both scales. The number of taxa shows a maximum at depths between 200 and 700 m followed by a gradual decrease down to 2,200 m. At the broad scale, multibeam data provides a variety of terrain variables that indicate environmental variation (e.g. exposure to currents, interpreted substrates). This analysis identifies six fauna groups associated to specific landscape elements. Diversity of megafauna shows a strong correlation with number of bottom types occurring along video transects. It is highest at the shelf break and decreased with depth on the slope in parallel with a decrease in habitat heterogeneity and temperature. At a fine scale, six biotopes are identified based on megafauna composition with habitat characteristics ranging from homogenous muddy bottom, biotope 1, to the most heterogeneous bottom with > 20% rocks and several bottom types present in biotope 6. The macrofauna sampled is used for description of the whole benthic community, including diversity, biomass and production, related to these six biotopes. The variation in percentage cover of substrate types and in particular the cover of hard substrates demonstrate to be a good proxy for the benthic community composition (mega- and macrofauna) and its diversity.

AB  - The Early Metal Period (1800 cal BC-AD 300) of the Finnish inland regions is characterized by a scarcity of archaeological remains. Its latest stages, in particular, have proved to be difficult to interpret. This paper discusses the continuity of settlement in the Early Metal Period as indicated by archaeological survey and pollen-analytical data. The study area is situated in Repovesi National Park in southeastern Finland. The pollen analysis was constructed from a sediment sequence taken from Lake Katajajarvi. The archaeological survey data from Repovesi National Park supports earlier hypotheses of the small number of Early Metal Period sites. In the pollen data, the first anthropogenic impact is recorded from about 2600 BC onwards, with weak signs of cultivation around 2370 BC. From around 1900 BC onwards a clear change in tree, shrub and herb pollen percentages indicates anthropogenic impact, possibly grazing, in the area. The pollen-analytical results also revealed a cultivation period of about 900 years at the end of the Early Metal Period, providing proof of continuity in settlement during a period characterized by a scarcity of archaeological material. A new beginning of cultivation from cal AD 1160 to 1250 onwards can be considered as indicating population growth, developing settlements and the colonization of new areas. The results from Repovesi are challenging from an archaeological point of view, because they represent slash-and-burn cultivation that appears to have been practised in total wilderness conditions. Comparison of the Lake Katajajarvi results with other areas raises new questions that call for a discussion of early slash-and-burn cultivation in new perspective.

AB  - Harvesting stumps and logging residues for energy production may have negative impacts on forest species, especially those associated with dead wood. We assessed the potential impact of biofuel harvest on epiphytic lichens by studying the lichen assemblages on stumps and downed fine woody debris (FWD) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in clear-cut, mature managed, and old-growth forest stands in eastern Finland. We also examined the impact of tree retention level and prescribed burning on these assemblages. A total of 102 lichen species (including 13 red-listed species) were observed, with 95 species on stumps and 69 species on downed FWD. Composition of the species assemblages differed between stumps and downed FWD and between stumps of different age. Tree retention (in comparison with clear-cut sites) and prescribed burning resulted in a slightly higher species richness on cut stumps 12 years after harvest but did not affect the assemblages on downed FWD or older stumps. We conclude that stumps and downed FWD of Scots pine can host high numbers of lichen species, including red-listed ones. Most of the species occurred also on other substrates and are, therefore, not likely to be affected by biofuel harvest. However, for dead wood dependent lichen species, intensive biofuel harvest is potentially harmful, though the severity of this impact likely depends on the landscape-level availability of other woody substrates.

AB  - Projected warming in Sweden and other Fennoscandian countries will probably increase growth rates of forest trees near their northern limits, increase the probability of new pest outbreaks, and foster northerly migration of both native and exotic species. The greatest challenges for sustainable forestry are to restore and enhance the ecological and socioeconomic diversity of intensively managed forested landscapes. With appropriate management, climate warming may facilitate the regeneration of this diversity. Experimental transplant gardens along latitudinal or altitudinal gradients and high-resolution maps of expected future climate could provide a scientific basis for predicting the climate response of potential migrant species. Management of corridors and assisted migration could speed the movement of appropriate species.

AB  - Nematodes have been identified as a potentially hyperdiverse group and the deep sea as a potentially hyperdiverse environment (i.e. > 1 million species). A large-scale data set from the equatorial central Pacific is used to estimate regional diversity with results that challenge this view; regional diversity is higher in some coastal waters despite lower sample diversity in coastal waters than in the deep sea. The data suggests a paradigm where the deep sea has modest regional diversity, despite high local diversity through patch dynamics, because similar patches in a similar habitat are repeated for considerable distances. Disturbance in shallow water dominates over patch-dynamic mechanisms reducing local diversity but regional diversity is high because of the close packing of multiple habitats within a single region.
   The Pacific data are also used to demonstrate the pitfalls of extrapolating from local to global diversity. There is no reason to conclude that nematodes are less diverse than other benthic groups, indeed where direct comparison is possible the Nematoda appear to be as diverse as the Polychaeta, the most diverse macrofaunal taxon. This analysis is not consistent with the hypothesis that either marine nematodes or the deep-sea benthos are hyperdiverse raising the question whether any environment or metazoan taxon has more than a million species.

AB  - Early adopter-farmers form a living lab of farms that have a great deal of hidden knowledge about the cultivation of cover crops (CCs). Understanding of how early adopters use and value CCs provides valuable knowhow to be shared with other farmers. This study gathered information about the most common under-sown CCs in Finland. A structured survey was used to collect farmers' experiences considering CCs' regional suitability, growth, competition, and impacts on soil and cash crop yields. The respondents were both conventional and organic farmers who cultivated CCs in 2020. One thousand one hundred and thirty farmers answered the survey. Four hundred and ten times they shared knowhow about the use of under-sown CCs. They were mostly familiar with clovers, ryegrasses, and timothy as CCs. They answered 27 specific statements on CC (a Likert scale, five answer choices). Farmers' experiences were well in line with the understanding gained from field experiments. Farmers had experienced positive impacts of CCs on soil health. Organic farmers were slightly more positive than conventional farmers. This is attributable to a longer period of having CCs in organic farms, and general differences in means to control weeds and manage crop nutrition. Gained experience with common species used in grassland mixtures had strengthened farmers' trust in their use of CCs. Farmers having high cereal areas are an important target group for sharing the early adopters' experiences, as cereal farmers were more challenged to use even common CCs. Future research and on-farm experiments should focus on CCs with other cash crops instead of cereals (grain legumes, rapeseed, and other minor crops).

AB  - Bird-plant species associations can be an important component of habitat selection in forest birds. We assessed tree species preferences of foraging insectivorous birds in a primeval beech-fir forest in north-west Slovakia, hypothesizing that bird population densities are negatively associated with foraging specialization. We sampled foraging behaviour by random point observations from mid-May until the end of July during 1997-2003. Significant preference or avoidance patterns were found in 16 of 17 bird species. Based on the tree preference index, we distinguished four main foraging specializations: generalists, deciduous specialists, coniferous specialists, and dead wood specialists. Many bird species showed strong preferences for such rare and uncommon tree species as wych elm (Ulmus glabra), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). European beech (Fagus sylvatica), hazel (Corylus avellana), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) were generally avoided. Birds with low densities tended to be most selective, but that effect was not statistically significant. Population variability was not significantly associated with foraging specialization. We hypothesize that impoverishment of tree species diversity within forest stands could lead to less diverse bird assemblages composed of species specialized on those tree species remaining and of generalist foragers able to adapt to a wide range of foraging substrates.

We initially studied the facilitative effect of the beaverCastor canadensison a waterbird community consisting of three waders and four ducks in boreal wetlands in southern Finland. Both waterbird species diversity and abundance increased when beavers impounded a pond. Common tealAnas creccaand green sandpiperTringa ochropuswere the species showing the most positive numerical response, but the other five species also increased upon flooding. This article evaluates how the results of the study have been used in management, both in theory and practice. The whole-community facilitation concept has been taken up in numerous articles considering the restorative effects of beavers. It has also been used as ecological background when planning and executing man-made wetland projects in Finland within both the public and the private sectors. Our study and its publication inAquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystemshave set a foundation for further evidence-based management of waterbird communities. As the results show, having beavers as wetland managers is a feasible tool for creating and restoring wetlands for waterbirds and other biota. Moreover, wetland restoration projects are becoming more popular endeavours, owing to an understanding of the diverse benefits of wetlands. Flooding by beavers is used as a model for managers when creating man-made wetlands; for example, in urban areas where it is difficult to maintain beavers. 1.2.3.4.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of the spatial link between service providing areas (SPA) and service benefiting areas (SBA). Understanding the spatial link between SPAs and SBAs is essential when studying the ecosystem service delivery and the fulfilment of ecosystem service demand. However, far too little attention has been paid to the user movement related ecosystem services and where people should be geographically situated in order to benefit from these services. In the movement related services, benefiting areas are equal to providing areas and the spatial link from residential area to SPA is important. The spatial link is addressed through the concept of accessibility which determines the opportunity to move from the area where beneficiaries are located to areas where ecosystem services are produced.
   This study presents an accessibility approach to the ecosystem services research. Accessibility analyses offer an opportunity to identify the gap between the ecosystems' potential to produce services and the actual usage possibilities of such services. We demonstrate the suitability of the method by using outdoor recreation and cultural heritage as examples of cultural ecosystem services that people actively want to reach. Accessibility was calculated using a geographical information system-based least-cost path analysis, which measures travel time by car between residential location and the nearest SPA via road network.
   The examples highlight that accessibility varies according to the ecosystem service and depends mostly on population distribution and travel possibilities. Our results demonstrate that the density of the analysed ecosystem service opportunities is higher near urban areas than elsewhere. The accessibility of different ecosystem services also depends on how much time people are willing to spend for reaching these services. Our study emphasised that, from a population perspective, accessibility analyses provide a powerful tool for illustrating the utilisation possibilities of spatially distributed ecosystem services. The accessibility approach offers great potential to assess the potential use of SPAs and respond to the need to develop a practical tool for ecosystem service research. It effectively shows, for example, the areas where the risk of overuse of ecosystem services is increased. Knowing about the regional differences in ecosystem service usage also gives background information for the decision-makers for drawing conclusions about how much and where it is sensible to invest in the maintenance of ecosystem services.

AB  - Sustainable tourism has emerged as the dominant paradigm for managing visitor use in protected areas. An important consequence of this approach is that management tends to focus on issues inside protected-area boundaries. Recently, broader landscape-oriented approaches have gained attention (e.g., the European Landscape Convention [ELC]). These strategies strive to achieve sustainable landscape protection and often identify tourism as a key development strategy. Using Sweden as an example, this article explores the intersection of the landscape conceptas articulated in the ELCwith the contemporary notion of sustainable tourism management in protected areas. This exploratory study was conducted using qualitative research methods. While study participants reported strong potential in landscape-oriented approaches, they also identified key challenges including institutional negotiation and conflict and confusion and uncertainty about the landscape concept. The article concludes by addressing the implications for enhancing sustainable tourism management through adoption of landscape-oriented approaches.

AB  - Soil health assessments that integrate physical, chemical and biological indicators help the evaluation of soil functioning, provide a framework for monitoring soil degradation, guide land management activities and secure the delivery of soil ecosystem services. In this study, we assessed soil health by soil texture class on arable land in Southeast Norway and mid-Norway and between grassland and arable land in mid-Norway. We used descriptive statistics and the Welch t-test with unequal variance and Bonferroni corrections to compare a physical soil indicator (bulk density) and chemical indicators (organic matter, P-AL, K-AL, Ca-AL, Mg-AL, Na-AL and pH). We developed scoring curves from cumulative normal distribution functions on regional soil data for various soil indicators where climate, soil texture class and land use were considered. Our results show that for certain soil texture classes, average soil indicator values differed between pedo-climatic zones on arable land, but for others the difference was not significant. The variability between the pedo-climatic zones for these can be neglected, but for the ones that differ, the variability is important to consider when assessing soil health. Similarly, this was the case when comparing land use (grassland and arable land) for most soil indicators in mid-Norway. This finding illustrates the importance of addressing unique local conditions in soil health assessments. We propose aggregating similar soil texture classes where no differences are apparent when developing scoring curves. The sub-optimal levels of plant available nutrients (P-AL and K-AL) found in the soil in both pedo-climatic zones highlights the importance of suitable threshold values for targeted soil ecosystem services to ensure soil health and sustainable agricultural production. We also recommend prioritizing the most relevant soil ecosystem services to limit the number of soil indicators that need monitoring.

AB  - Albedo and CO2 sequestration are the two most important climate forcing factors in forestry. After harvest the albedo in boreal forests increases which has a cooling effect. Likewise, CO2 captured in the photosynthesis reduce atmospheric CO2 and thereby have a cooling effect. These effects have value to society, and they may affect optimal management. This article investigates the effect on economical optimal forest management - here the optimal harvest age - by payment for these forcers. The albedo effect is evaluated using the standard climate metric global warming potential (GWP) with a time horizon of 100 years, i.e. in terms of CO2 equivalents. Alternative measures are discussed. The cooling effect of albedo change at time of harvest for the total Norwegian harvest corresponds to about 1.3% of the current Norwegian GHG emissions. The variation in albedo effect across the southern part of the country is modest. The CO2 sequestration effect is much larger than the albedo. At the time of harvest the CO2 content in forest is more than 40 times the albedo effect. The carbon effect will therefore dominate the effect on the harvest age. Payments for climate services will prolong the rotation period. With the current quota price in the EU ETS - about 80(sic) ton(-1) CO2 equivalents - and current stumpage value, carbon capture and storage will be more profitable than commercial timber production for young stands. For stands close to maturity, the payment scheme will have little effect.

AB  - Prior to a present paper, 918 species of basidiomycete fungi were known in the Pskov region (Russia), including 512 species recorded in the Sebezhskiy National Park. Fungal inventorying studies in Protected Areas are an important part of biodiversity assessment. The constantly expanding knowledge on this vast group of organisms, powered by new finds in the field and advances in molecular genetics, make fungal inventorying in any territory a long-term effort rather than an isolated event. In 2019, we assessed the fungal biota of the Polistovskiy State Nature Reserve (Pskov region, Russia) in various forest types in the core and buffer zones along nine designated routes. The material was studied using the standard methods of fungal taxonomy. As a result, 74 basidomycete species new to Pskov region were revealed. Among them, six species (Galerina hybrida, Gymnopus erythropus, Lepiota boudieri, Pluteus velutinus, Rugosomyces obscurissimus, and Simocybe haustellaris) were new to the Northwest of European Russia and four species (Achroomyces effusus, Botryobasidium stigmatisporum, Galerina caulocystidiata, and Pseudobaeospora celluloderma) were new for Russia. The former are here provided with brief notes, whereas the latter are supplied with descriptions of studied specimens, drawings of microstructures and discussion of their distribution, habitats, similar and closely related species, and current state of knowledge. We found also Hemistropahria albocrenulata, a protected species in Finland and the adjacent Leningrad region and Novgorod region. Helicogloea compressa was registered for the second time in Russia, with another record in St. Petersburg city. Despite substantially expanding our knowledge of the mycobiota in both the Polistovskiy State Nature Reserve and Pskov region, the present data are still insufficient for a comprehensive quantitative analysis of its structure.

AB  - Carbon removal certification may become a powerful instrument to accelerate decarbonization efforts. In Europe, its implementation is expected to foster the deployment of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Yet, the large-scale adoption of BECCS is also limited by the availability of a costly CO2 transportation infrastructure shared with fossil-fueled emitters. In this paper, we examine the interactions between carbon removal accounting (which determines financial incentives for BECCS) and optimal CO2 infrastructure deployment by asking how certification affects the feasibility of BECCS projects. We propose an original economic framework to explore this question and apply it to a real case study in Sweden. Assuming carbon removal credits will be integrated into the prevailing carbon market, we show that, although a carbon removal accounting framework based on a lifecycle methodology discourages investment in inefficient BECCS processes, it may induce BECCS lock-out from CO2 infrastructures. We formulate two policy recommendations to overcome such a BECCS lock-out: (i) forward-looking CO2 infrastructure planning and (ii) complementary policy support.

AB  - The North American tree Pinus contorta var, latifolia was experimentally introduced in Sweden already in the 1920s, and has been used in Swedish forestry on a large scale since the 1970s. These plantations now cover 565,000 ha, mainly in the northern area.
   In this paper we summarize and discuss existing ecological knowledge of this species introduction. With regard to longterm sustainability we suggest management means to minimize harmful effects of the introduction on ecosystems. These include aspects of self dispersal, pests, ecosystem and landscape structures, and also ecological processes and biodiversity. We also focus on observed and possible interactions in the ecosystems. As Pinus contorta seeds are disseminated and trees regenerated outside initial plantations, this may have future bearings on biodiversity.
   We suggest a strategy which takes account of the uncertainty in predicting future ecological effects. The strategy includes areal restrictions and zones without Pinus contorta, but also to set up a monitoring program. Observations of adverse effects from the plantations would then give the possibility to adjust P. contorta management. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid destruction of forest habitats has led to the establishment of protected areas in formerly managed forests with the aim of restoring biodiversity. Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi. We therefore suggest a conservation strategy for preserving old-growth forests and establishing protected forest stands to enhance structural heterogeneity in spruce-dominated forests. For this, a careful screening of protected areas throughout Europe is necessary to provide managers with guidelines for conservation.
