AB  - We studied the oribatid mite communities in forest floor and in decaying wood in pine (Pinus sylvestris), spruce (Picea abies) and deciduous (mainly Betula pendula and B. pubescens) forests at different latitudes in Finland. The study sites were either in mature managed forests or in old-growth forests in nature reserves. Altogether 78 sites were sampled in 2004 and 2005, yielding a total of 38,145 oribatid mites belonging to 133 species, of which four were new to Finland. Oribatid mite communities differed in terms of total number and community structure between forest types and latitudes within the boreal. forest zone. The most abundant and diverse communities were in spruce forests and at central and southern latitudes. Total oribatid number in deciduous forests was three-fold tower compared to that in coniferous forests; stilt the number of species was roughly equal in all forests. The greatest differences in communities were observed between forest floor and decaying wood microhabitats. Total densities in decaying wood were three-fold tower than in coniferous forest floor. Strong differences were also observed in community structure (indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)), although the majority of the species encountered were shared. Our results suggest that decaying wood maintains diverse sub-communities of mites which vary little between different forests and latitudes. Coarse woody debris (CWD) provides favorable habitat for many forest floor species and arboreal habitat species. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the changes caused by management, including drainage and thinnings, in peatland forest stand structure. Drained peatland sites in Finnish North Karelia were compared within the same type groups and nutrient status levels of virgin peatlands in the Republic of Karelia, the Russian Federation. The Variables studied, which depict stand structure variation, included: (1) the diameter of the median tree; (2) the range of sampled diameters; (3) the basal area of the stand; (4) the estimated number of tree storeys; and (5) the number of the tree species. The number of tree storeys was determined through non-parametric Kernel estimation.
   Over a long duration, management smooths the natural multi-modal structure of virgin peatland stocking by decreasing the variation in size-distribution. Management also changes the natural tree species dynamics on peatland sites by providing a competitive advantage to the tree species, which adjust best to the changed growing conditions. These species begin to dominate the habitat and reduce the species diversity. The effect of recent thinnings and cleaning cuttings on the forest structure is dependent upon fertility of the site and the stage of the forest stock at the moment of silvicultural operation. Cleaning cuttings may have also an increasing effect on the structural diversity of peatland forest stand. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper explores policy change in Swedish coastal and marine conservation, identifying advocacy coalition factors-focusing internal and external events, policy learning, and negotiated agreements-that explain divergent outcomes in disputed national park planning processes. A longitudinal study, covering three decades of three planning processes, indicates that all factors matter. External and internal events, combined with policy learning or negotiated agreements, constituted the main change pathways. We noted that events' influence on learning and agreements was facilitated by policy brokers and mediated through new venues and altered actor strategies. The findings indicated that competing coalitions' policy beliefs influenced the specific routes taken and underlined the centrality of governmental actors to different outcomes. The study illustrates how political conflicts occur and are addressed in environmental governance, generates insights critical to implementing international and national conservation policy, and builds theoretical knowledge of pathways to policy change in disputed policy processes.

AB  - Generalised linear models (GLMs) were used to estimate the alpha diversity of the ground vegetation of boreal managed forests. Alpha diversity was described using Simpson's reciprocal, which was employed as a response variable in modelling, the explanatory variables being the tree and site characteristics The data were from Northern Karelia, Eastern Finland. Several combinations of error and link functions were used to examine the patterns in the data, the best results being obtained with a model containing the normal error and identity link function, and the second power of the explanatory variable and one containing the gamma error and reciprocal link function. Site type, the presence of pubescent birch and the basal area of the stand were the significant variables in these models.
   It was concluded that GLMs are suitable tools for estimating biodiversity within the scope of the present data. In addition, it was found that the highest ground vegetation diversity exists within fertile stands with a mixture of birch and a low stand basal area. Models of this kind would be useful in forest management planning in order to study the effect of management on vegetational diversity using the values of different tree stand and site variables before and after treatment.

AB  - Models of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and turnover can be useful tools to analyse the effects of soil and crop management practices and climate change on soil organic carbon stocks. The aggregated structure of soil is known to protect SOC from decomposition and, thus, influence the potential for long-term sequestration. In turn, the turnover and storage of SOC affects soil aggregation, physical and hydraulic properties and the productive capacity of soil. These two-way interactions have not yet been explicitly considered in modelling approaches. In this study, we present and describe a new model of the dynamic feedbacks between soil organic matter (SOM) storage and soil physical properties (porosity, pore size distribution, bulk density and layer thickness). A sensitivity analysis was first performed to understand the behaviour of the model. The identifiability of model parameters was then investigated by calibrating the model against a synthetic data set. This analysis revealed that it would not be possible to unequivocally estimate all of the model parameters from the kind of data usually available in field trials. Based on this information, the model was tested against measurements of bulk density, SOC concentration and limited data on soil water retention and soil surface elevation made during 63 years in a field trial located near Uppsala (Sweden) in three treatments with different organic matter (OM) inputs (bare fallow, animal and green manure). The model was able to accurately reproduce the changes in SOC, soil bulk density and surface elevation observed in the field as well as soil water retention curves measured at the end of the experimental period in 2019 in two of the treatments. Treatment-specific variations in SOC dynamics caused by differences in OM input quality could be simulated very well by modifying the value for the OM retention coefficient epsilon (0.37 for animal manure and 0.14 for green manure). The model approach presented here may prove useful for management purposes, for example, in an analysis of carbon sequestration or soil degradation under land use and climate change.

AB  - Question: How have species richness and vegetation patterns changed in a group of islands in the northern Baltic Sea over a 58-yr period of changing land use and increasing eutrophication?
   Location: A group of 116 islands, the Brunskar subarchipelago, in SW Finland.
   Methods: A complete survey of vascular plant species performed in 1947-1949 by Skult was repeated by our group using the same methodology in 2005-2007 (historical versus contemporary, respectively). DCAs were performed and total number of species, extinction-colonization rates, species frequency changes and mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, moisture and nitrogen and Eklund indicator values for dependence of human cultural influence were obtained for each island and releve.
   Results: Species richness has declined on large islands and increased on small islands. The increase in number of species on small islands is driven by a strong increase in frequency of shore species, which in turn is induced by more productive shores. The decrease in species richness on large islands is related to overgrowth of open semi-natural habitats after cessation of grazing and other agricultural practices.
   Conclusions: After the late 1940s, open habitats, which were created and maintained by cattle grazing and other traditional agricultural activities, have declined in favour of woody shrub and forest land. Shores have been stabilized and influenced by the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, and the vegetation has become more homogeneous. This development, resulting in lower species diversity, poses a challenge for the preservation of biodiversity both on a local and on a landscape level.

AB  - Agricultural practice is facing multiple challenges under volatile commodity markets, inevitable climate change, mounting pest pressure and various other environment-related constraints. The objective of this research is to present a dynamic optimization model of crop rotations and farm management and show its suitability for economic analysis over a 30 year time period. In this model, we include management practices such as fertilization, fungicide treatment and liming, and apply it in a region in Southwestern Finland. Results show that (i) growing pest pressure favours the cultivation of wheat-oats and wheat-oilseeds combinations, while (ii) market prices largely determine the crops in the rotation plan and the specific management practices adopted. The flexibility of our model can also be utilized in evaluating the value of other management options such as new cultivars under different projections of future climate and market conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate how future harvesting of spruce low stumps as a renewable energy source, might influence the saproxylic (wood living) beetle fauna. Species richness, abundance and assemblages of saproxylic beetles were compared on low stumps, high stumps and logs of spruce on 10 clear-cuts in northern Sweden. The sampling was conducted with emergence traps and a total of 929 individuals and 120 species were collected. No significant differences in beetle abundance or species richness were detected between substrate types. However, there were clear differences in assemblage composition between all substrate types. Our results suggest that low stumps created at final felling support as many species and individuals per volume dead wood as other dead wood substrates and that they are therefore overlooked as substrates for wood living organisms. Consequently, harvesting of low stumps might have negative effects on the diversity of saproxylic beetles, as up to 80% of the dead wood remaining on clear-cuts is in the form of low stumps. Future studies should evaluate if compensatory measures can be performed to minimize negative impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Structural complexity of the habitat is known to influence the diversity and abundance of arthropod populations. Earlier studies have shown that presence of logging residue ( slash) on the ground contributes to microhabitat complexity and removal of slash for biofuel in clear-cuts can have short-term ( similar to 1 year) effects on ground-active beetle populations. This study examines the consequences of slash removal on carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) 5-7 years after harvest. Sampling of beetles was done by pitfall trapping in three matched clear-cut pairs, in spruce forest in central Sweden. The number and diversity (Berger-Parker dominance index) of carabid species were significantly higher in clear-cuts with slash harvest than in sites where slash was left on the ground. No difference in the overall rank-abundance pattern was found between clear-cuts with different slash treatments, but for species with certain habitat preferences the community was significantly altered. In all clear-cuts, slash removal caused a shift in dominance with an increase in generalist species and a decline in forest species. The results show that removal of slash may have long-lasting effects on the carabid community composition and structure. Hence, in forest landscapes with large-scale biofuel harvest, generalist carabid species may increase their abundance. Following the precautionary principle, it is suggested that every fifth clear-cut should be free of slash harvest.

AB  - The fauna of surface-active spiders was studied in 12 cereal fields, with two types of subcrop, and in four young (17 months old) perennial leys (grass/clover). The fields were located in the southeastern (A), central (B) and western (C) parts of Norway. In total, 3945 spiders were caught from May to September 2004, using pitfall traps. Linyphidae was the most numerous family, with Erigone atra Blackwall 1833 representing 56% of all trapped individuals. The total numbers of spider species and individuals were significantly higher in leys than in barley at sites where both crops were present (sites A and B), with on average 11 species and 93 specimens in barley, and 20 species and 393 specimens in leys. Thus, young perennial leys appeared to provide a better habitat for spiders than did cereal fields, as has previously been documented for older perennial leys. The use of multi-species crops instead of a single crop species undersown in cereals, tended to result in higher spider species diversity, but it did not influence the total number of specimens. An ordination (DCA) showed a clustering of the spider fauna from the same site, but no clear separation between main crop types (ley vs. barley) was apparent. The main crops, subcrops, and the surrounding environs of the cropped field seem to affect the diversity and abundance of spiders.

AB  - Knowledge of population structure and genetic diversity and the spatio-temporal demographic processes affecting populations is crucial for effective wildlife preservation, yet these factors are still poorly understood for organisms with large continuous ranges. Available population genetic data reveal that widespread mammals have for the most part only been carefully studied at the local population scale, which is insufficient for understanding population processes at larger scales. Here, we provide data on population structure, genetic diversity and gene flow in a brown bear population inhabiting the large territory of northwestern Eurasia. Analysis of 17 microsatellite loci indicated significant population substructure, consisting of four genetic groups. While three genetic clusters were confined to small geographical areas-located in Estonia, southern Finland and Leningrad oblast, Russia-the fourth cluster spanned a very large area broadly falling between northern Finland and the Arkhangelsk and Kirov oblasts of Russia. Thus, the data indicate a complex pattern where a fraction of the population exhibits large-scale gene flow that is unparalleled by other wild mammals studied to date, while the remainder of the population appears to have been structured by a combination of demographic history and landscape barriers. These results based on nuclear data are generally in good agreement with evidence previously derived using mitochondrial markers, and taken together, these markers provide complementary information about female-specific and population-level processes. Moreover, this study conveys information about spatial processes occurring over multiple generations that cannot be readily gained using other approaches, e. g. telemetry.

AB  - Purpose of Review Outbreaks of tree-killing bark beetles have reached unprecedented levels in conifer forests in the northern hemisphere and are expected to further intensify due to climate change. In parts of Europe, bark beetle outbreaks and efforts to manage them have even triggered social unrests and political instability. These events have increasingly challenged traditional responses to outbreaks, and highlight the need for a more comprehensive management framework. Recent Findings Several synthesis papers on different aspects of bark beetle ecology and management exist. However, our understanding of outbreak drivers and impacts, principles of ecosystem management, governance, and the role of climate change in the dynamics of ecological and social systems has rapidly advanced in recent years. These advances are suggesting a reconsideration of previous management strategies. We synthesize the state of knowledge on drivers and impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in Europe and propose a comprehensive context-dependent framework for their management. We illustrate our ideas for two contrasting societal objectives that represent the end-members of a continuum of forest management goals: wood and biomass production and the conservation of biodiversity and natural processes. For production forests, we propose a management approach addressing economic, social, ecological, infrastructural, and legislative aspects of bark beetle disturbances. In conservation forests, where non-intervention is the default option, we elaborate under which circumstances an active intervention is necessary, and whether such an intervention is in conflict with the objective to conserve biodiversity. Our approach revises the current management response to bark beetles in Europe and promotes an interdisciplinary social-ecological approach to dealing with disturbances.

AB  - The coastal zone of Norway is long with complex topography. The fisheries along the coast, and in more recent years fish-farming, are important to the Norwegian community, its welfare and economy in a long-term perspective. Crucial conditions to these industries are maintenance of high, natural production and biodiversiry and good water quality along the coast, which call for sustainable management of human activities and exploitation of resources. The utilization and production of marine, renewable resources cannot be sustained where the functional integrity of coastal systems is degraded. The objective of this paper is to argue for a holistic and ecosystem based coastal zone management with the aim to preserve habitats and living conditions for coastal living resources and abundant open sea fish stocks.

AB  - The diversity of future landscapes might depend on our ability to predict their potential species richness. The predictability of patterns of vascular plant species richness in a Finnish agricultural river landscape was studied using generalized linear modeling, floristic records from fifty-three 0.25-km grid squares in the "core" study area, and environmental variables derived from Landsat TM images and a digital elevation model. We built multiple regression models for the total number of plant species and the number of rarities, and validated the accuracy of the derived models with a test set of 52 grid squares. We tentatively extrapolated the models from the core study area to the whole study area of 601 km(2) and produced species richness probability maps using GIS techniques. The results suggest that the local 'hotspots' of total flora (grid squares with > 200 species) are mainly found in river valleys, where habitat diversity is high and a semi-open agricultural-forest mosaic occurs. The 'hotspots' of rare species (grid squares with > 4 rare species) are also found in river valleys, in sites where extensive semi-natural grasslands and herb-rich deciduous forests occur on steep slopes. We conclude that environmental variables derived from satellite images and topographic data can be used as approximate surrogates of plant species diversity in agricultural landscapes. Modeling of biological diversity based on satellite images and GIS can provide useful information needed in land use planning. However, due to the potential pitfalls in processing satellite imagery and model-building procedures, the results of predictive models should be carefully interpreted.

AB  - Background Forest harvesting is the main driver of habitat degradation and biodiversity loss in forests of the boreal zone. To mitigate harmful effects, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within production forests. These include woodland key habitats, and other small-scale habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation action. This article describes a protocol for a systematic review to synthesize the value of small habitat patches left within production landscapes for biodiversity. The topic for this systematic review arose from a discussion with the Finnish forestry sector and was further defined in a stakeholder workshop. Research question: Do small protected habitat patches within production forests provide value for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests? Animal, plant and fungal diversities are addressed as well as the amount of deadwood within the habitat patches as proxy indicators for biodiversity. Methods The literature, both peer-reviewed and grey, will be searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Article screening will be done at two stages (title/abstract and full-text). The validity of the studies included will be evaluated against validity criteria and studies will be categorized based on their risk of bias. To describe the findings a narrative synthesis will be conducted. If there is enough quantitative data retrieved from the studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted.

AB  - Biodiversity degradation is a national and global problem which is interconnected with land use and climate change. All these are major unsolved questions and their interactions are only partly understood. Agriculture and especially cattle farming is under keen societal focus because of its significant role in soil carbon losses, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity preservation. We reviewed the Finnish scientific literature to assess the impact of intensive contra extensive grass production on biodiversity using vascular plants, vertebrates, invertebrates and soil biota. Still a few decades ago, mixed farming was prevailing almost everywhere in Finland, but nowadays cereal production is essentially clustered in the southwest and milk and beef production in the northeast. This is reflected in the distribution of intensive (connected with cattle) and extensive grasslands (both types of farming). The bird community was most abundant and species rich in farmland which provides small fields in large blocks of farmland and many kinds of crops, including both intensive and extensive grasslands. Overall permanent grasslands with rather simply vegetation diversity can maintain a diverse community of spiders and leafhoppers, and act as overwintering habitat for polyphagous predators in field ecosystems. The ecological requirement of all species and species groups are probably never met at one site and consequently target should be in having differently managed areas at regional scale. For some of the taxa, ecosystem services could be indicated, but a research-based quantitative assessment is available only for carbon sequestration and weak impact of dung-beetles in diminishing GHG emissions from cow pats. Our review demonstrated that quite much is known about biodiversity in extensively managed grasslands, but very little in intensively managed grasslands. An important question is whether there is some threshold for the proportion of grasslands under which regional biodiversity will be reduced. Intensive production offers limited value to replace the high biodiversity value of semi-natural pastures.

AB  - Loss of connectivity and habitat destruction may lead to genetic depletion of wild animal populations, especially in species requiring large, connected territories as the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Brown bear populations of North Western Russia, Finland and Northern Norway have been assumed to form one large, continuous population; however this hypothesis has not been tested sufficiently. We have genotyped 1,887 samples from 2005 to 2008 from four distinct areas and used the resulting DNA profiles from 146 different individuals to analyze the genetic diversity, population structure, and the migration rates among groups. In addition, we have tested for traces of previous genetic bottlenecks. Individuals from Eastern Finland and Russian Karelia were grouped in the same cluster ("Karelia"), while distinctive subpopulations of brown bears were detected in the north ("Pasvik"), and the east ("Pinega"). All three subpopulations displayed high genetic variation, with expected heterozygosities (H (E)) of 0.77-0.81, but differentiation among the clusters was relatively low (average F (ST) = 0.051, P < 0.001). No evidence of genetic bottlenecks in the past was found. We detected a highly significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern. For Pasvik, self-recruitment was found to be very high (96%), pointing to the possibility of genetic isolation. In contrast, between Karelia and Pinega we detected high, bi-directional migration rates (similar to 30%), indicating genetic exchange. Conclusively, despite of a substantial influence of IBD on the genetic structure in the region, we detected considerable variation in connectivity among the identified clusters that could not be explained solely by the distance between them.

AB  - In this paper, Norwegian and Irish consumers' willingness-to-pay for salmon that is produced under more sustainable aquaculture practices is examined using the contingent valuation method. A bivariate probit model is estimated where the consideration of environmentally friendly fish farming at time of purchase is jointly estimated with willingness-to-pay. The predicted joint probabilities of the bivariate probit model are calculated in order to examine if concerns for the environmental credentials of salmon aquaculture translate into willingness-to-pay a price premium for sustainably farmed fish. The results suggest that environmental concerns and attitudes are not the sole motivating factors influencing consumption behaviours.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the effects of management on the production of timber and energy biomass, and ecosystem carbon balance in Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands, with impacts on carbon neutrality of the use of biomass in energy production. In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

AB  - In time of climate change, close-to-nature silviculture is growing in importance as a tool for future forest management. The paper study the tree layer and natural regeneration of monospecific Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), trough mixed spruce-beech to dominant European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests in Jizerske hory Mts., the Czech Republic. In the locality, shelterwood and selection system have been applied since 2000. The research objectives were to evaluate production parameters, structural diversity, species richness, natural regeneration dynamics and radial growth of individual tree species in relation to climatic factors and air pollution. The stand volume on permanent research plots amounted to 441 - 731 m(3) ha(-1) in initial stage of transformation. Natural regeneration showed high expansion of beech and decrease of spruce compared to mature tree species composition. Radial growth of spruce was in significant negative correlation with SO2 and NOX concentrations compared to no effect on beech increment. Moreover, spruce was more sensitive to significant years with extreme low radial growth. Beech was more stable in radial growth. Spruce was more resistant to air pollution and climatic stress in mixed stands. Low temperature was limiting factor of radial growth together with climate extremes (such as strong frosts and more frequent droughts) and biotic factors (bark beetle, beech scale). Close-to-nature management supporting admixed tree species should lead in future to diversification of stand structure toward higher species, spatial and age structure to mitigate negative effect of climatic change.

AB  - Like all headwater systems, springs have been increasingly modified by multiple land uses, but the effects of these modifications on species diversity and community composition are poorly understood. We assessed the consequences of forestry-related disturbance (mainly draining) on benthic macroinvertebrate and bryophyte diversity and community composition in boreal springs. We used predictive modeling (BEnthic Assessment of SedimenT [BEAST]), indicator species analysis, and descriptive statistics on data from 55 near-pristine reference springs and 20 modified (test) springs spanning 3 ecoregions (hemiboreal to middle boreal) in Finland. Invertebrate and bryophyte communities were relatively similar between the reference and test springs. BEAST identified deviation from the reference condition in 9 and 10 sites based on benthic macroinvertebrates and bryophytes, respectively. These sites were identified mostly as possibly different from reference, with the exception of a few seriously degraded springs with low levels of groundwater flow. Indicator species for both reference-condition and test springs included spring-preferring and ubiquitous taxa. Bryophyte richness was lower in test than in reference springs, but no significant differences were detected for macroinvertebrate richness. Red-listed species were more common in reference than in test springs. Our results suggest that, despite only moderate effects on community composition, anthropogenic disturbance impoverishes spring fauna and flora and causes a decline of spring-preferring red-listed species. Restoration will be necessary to preserve biodiversity in springs, but benign methods should be used to avoid further disturbance to biota, particularly red-listed spring specialists.

AB  - The ongoing global climate change is challenging all sectors, forestry notwithstanding. On the one hand, forest ecosystems are exposed to and threatened by climate change, but on the other hand, forests can influence the course of climate change by regulating the water regime, air quality, carbon sequestration, and even reduce climate extremes. Therefore, it is crucial to see climate change not only as a risk causing forest disturbances and economic consequences but also as an opportunity for innovative approaches to forest management, conservation, and silviculture based on the results of long-term research. We reviewed 365 studies evaluating the impact of climate change on European forest ecosystems, all published during the last 30 years (1993-2022). The most significant consequences of climate change include more frequent and destructive large-scale forest disturbances (wildfire, windstorm, drought, flood, bark beetle, root rot), and tree species migration. Species distribution shifts and changes in tree growth rate have substantial effects on ecosystem carbon storage. Diameter/volume increment changed from -1 to +99% in Central and Northern Europe, while it decreased from -12 to -49% in Southern Europe across tree species over the last ca. 50 years. However, it is important to sharply focus on the causes of climate change and subsequently, on adaptive strategies, which can successfully include the creation of species-diverse, spatially and age-wise structured stands (decrease drought stress and increase production), prolongation of the regenerative period, or the use of suitable introduced tree species (e.g., Douglas fir, black pine, and Mediterranean oaks). But the desired changes are based on increasing diversity and the mitigation of climate change, and will require significantly higher initial costs for silviculture practices. In conclusion, the scope and complexity of the topic require further comprehensive and long-term studies focusing on international cooperation. We see a critical gap in the transfer of research results into actual forest practice, which will be the key factor influencing afforestation of forest stands and forest growth in the following decades. What our forests will look like for future generations and what the resulting impact of climate change will be on forestry is in the hands of forest managers, depending on supportive forestry research and climate change policy, including adaptive and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Research on mammals in the Guianas of northern South America has had a checkered history. In this review, I summarize the notable contributions to mammalogical study in Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. These studies began in the mid-18th century with the binomial nomenclature system of scientific classification created by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who described 23 species new to science based on holotype specimens from the Guianas. Notwithstanding popular accounts by amateur naturalists visiting this region, over the next 7 decades there was only sporadic taxonomic work done on Guianan mammals primarily by researchers at European museums. The first comprehensive biological exploration took place in the 1840s during a geographic survey of the boundaries of British Guiana. However, it was not until almost half a century later that scientific publications began to regularly document the increasing species diversity in the region, including the prodigious work of Oldfield Thomas at the British Museum of Natural History in London. Another lull in the study of mammals occurred in the mid-1910s to the early 1960s after which foreign researchers began to rediscover the Guianas and their pristine habitats. This biological renaissance is still ongoing and I give a prospectus on the direction of future research in one of the last frontiers of tropical rainforest. An initiative that would be greatly beneficial is the establishment of a university network in the Guianas with graduate-based research to develop a cadre of professional experts on biodiversity and evolution as seen in other countries of South America.

AB  - Plant and vegetation preferences of two Norwegian cattle breeds grazing semi-natural mountain pastures were studied for two weeks at two farms during one summer. Two rather different grazing sites gave the opportunity to study the two breeds at different pasture qualities, as well as to test if there is any interaction between breeds and study sites. Each of the two herds consisted of the old, moderate yielding Norwegian dairy breed Blacksided Tronder and Nordland Cattle (STN) and the modern, high yielding dairy breed Norwegian Red (NRF). In order to measure the plant preferences of the animals, faeces samples were collected and analysed for plant fragments. In addition, GPS-data showed the terrain chosen by the herds, and vegetation maps were drawn to find the connections between the grazed vegetation and plant preferences. The study shows that on nutrient and especially species rich vegetation growing on base and nutrient rich soil, as at the first study site (Skabu), the plant species, plant genera and plant groups analysed for in the faeces samples indicate that both the STN and NRF breeds graze very much the same vegetation. However, the results from the second study site (Valdres), where the soil is less fertile, the plant species diversity is lower and the plant species distribution less uniform, the moderate yielding NRF breed seems to cover its higher nutritious requirements by grazing in areas with more nutrient rich vegetation compared to the lower yielding breed, STN.

AB  - Background Regenerative agriculture has gained attention in mainstream media, academic literature, and international politics in recent years. While many practices and outcomes relate to RA, there is no uniform definition of the term, and only a few comprehensive scientific studies exist of "real-life" farms and the complexity of what is considered regenerative management and its impact on soil health. Aims This study aimed to relate the impact of single and various combinations of regenerative management practices to soil health indicators on Gotland, Sweden. Methods Soil health of 17 farm fields and six gardens was assessed on 11 farms that had applied regenerative agricultural practices for zero to 30 years. We measured a variety of physical (bulk density , infiltration rate, wet aggregate stability, root depth and abundance, penetration resistance), chemical (pH, electric conductivity, C:N ratio, total organic carbon ) and biological (earthworm abundance, active carbon, microbial biomass carbon) soil indicators. These parameters were related to regenerative practices (reduced tillage, application of organic matter , livestock integration, crop diversity, and share of legumes and perennials) through a combination of hierarchical clustering, Analysis of Variance and Tukey's tests, principal component analysis, and multiple linear regressions. Results At our study sites, the application of organic matter had a positive impact on bulk density, carbon-related parameters, wet aggregate stability, and infiltration rate, while reduced tillage and increased share of perennials combined had a positive impact on vegetation density, root abundance and depth, and wet aggregate stability. The field plots were divided into four clusters according to their management, and we found significantly higher values of total organic carbon (*), C:N (*), infiltration rate (**), and earthworm abundance (*) for crop-high-org-input, the management cluster with highest values of organic matter application and no tillage. We found significantly higher values of vegetation density (***) and root abundance (**) for perm-cover-livestock, the cluster with no tillage, integration of livestocks, and permanent cover (*** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, degrees p > 0.1). Conclusions We support existing knowledge on positive impacts of regenerative practices, namely, the addition of an organic amendment that improved C-related parameters, as well as the positive effects on soil structure of reduced tillage in combination with an increased share of perennials. We argue for an outcome-based, and principle-led concept of RA as a context-dependent agricultural approach.

AB  - Based on the tree-ring chronology, we studied the radial increment of Swiss stone pine (Pinar cembra L.) and common spmce, or Norway spmce (Picea abies L.) as indicators of dendrochronological studies and, based on tree-ring chronology, reconstructed the annual changes of stem biomass and the amount of carbon accumulated in it by P. cembra and P. abies in the Gorgany Nature Reserve. Swiss stone pine stands are of great zoological importance as biotopes of nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes L.), crossbill (Loxia cuiyirostra L.), capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.) and other representatives of rare boreal fauna. Samples were taken from trees of the Playa forest district of the Brusturyan Forest Hunting Range State Enterprise of the Transcarpathian Regional Forestry Administration (P. cembra and P. abies) from trees that did not have visual signs of damage in the Gorgany Nature Reserve. By cross-dating the radial increments of two radii for each tree, individual chronological series were drawn up. Carbon sequestration in P. cembra and P. abies stem wood was evaluated on the basis of dendrochronological analysis of radial increment. The accuracy of cross-dating of dendrochronological series of individual trees, individual chronological series, and representativeness of the generalized series were verified by conventional methods. It was found that the average annual radial increment of the trees under study is 11.48 mm in P. cembra and 14.39 in P. abies, and varies in the range of 1.86-5.49 mm. The data obtained indicate an increase in the ability of P. cembra and P. abies to accumulate carbon with increasing age. The study of carbon sequestration in the stem wood of P. cembra and P. abies, based on dendrochronological analysis, made it possible to reconstruct the annual variation in stem biomass increment and accumulated carbon. The analysis of interdependence of the radial increment of P. cembra and P. abies in the Gorgany Nature Reserve and the value of carbon-containing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carried out by the augmented data sample, made it possible to specify the periods most significant for the formation of annual rings. The reaction in radial increment is most pronounced from June to September, with the annual values of carbon-containing greenhouse gases being maximally reflected in radial increment for the period from October to April.

AB  - Conservation crimes are posing serious threats to wildlife species and biodiversity of the Rungwa- Kizigo- Muhesi- Game- Reserves. Devising effective strategies to reduce risks to as low as reasonably possible of these crimes, calls for adequate information on factors driving people to commit these crimes. Data for this study were obtained from 315 respondents in 20 villages and 316 people who were arrested for committing different conservation crimes in the Rungwa- Kizigo- Muhesi- Game- Reserves. Our results suggest that arrested respondents were typically young adult males with limited alternative sources of income and owning virtually no livestock or land. There were heterogeneous drivers for each type of conservation crime. To address the challenge of conservation crimes in the Reserve, we recommend, among other strategies, the establishment of effective conservation education programmes, strengthening law enforcements as a deterrence method, and development of entrepreneurship skills to enhance employment.

AB  - Terraces and lynchets are ubiquitous worldwide and can provide increasingly important Ecosystem Services (ESs), which may be able to mitigate aspects of climate change. They are also a major cause of non-linearity between climate and erosion rates in agricultural systems as noted fromalluvial and colluvial studies. Newresearch in the `critical zone' has shown that we must now treat soil production as an ecologically sensitive variable with implications for soil carbon sequestration. In this reviewand synthesis paperwe present a modified classification of agricultural terraces, review the theoretical background of both terraces and lynchets, and show how new techniques are transforming the study of these widespread and often ancient anthropogenic landforms. The problems of dating terraces and the time-consuming nature of costly surveys have held back the geomorphological and geoarchaeological study of terraces until now. The suite of techniques nowavailable, and reviewed here, includes Digital ElevationModels (DEMs) - Structure fromMotion (SfM) photogrammetry, Airborne and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (ALS-TLS); optically stimulated luminescence (OSL and pOSL), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), Fourier-transform infra-red analysis (FTIR), phytoliths from plants, and potentially environmental DNA. Three process-related geomorphological questions arise from using this suite of methods; a) can they provide both a chronology of formation and use history, b) can we identify the sources of all the soil components? c) Can terrace soil formation and ecosystem services be modelled at the slope to catchment scale? The answers to these questions can also informthe management of the large areas of abandoned and under-used terraces that are resulting from both the economics of farming and rural population changes. Where possible, examples are drawn from a recently started ERC project (TerrACE; ERC-2018-2023; https://www.terrace.no/) that isworking at over 15 sites in Europe ranging from Norway to Greece.

AB  - Indicators for biodiversity are needed for efficient prioritization of forests selected for conservation. We analyzed the relationships between 86 wood-inhabiting fungal (polypore) species richness and 35 habitat variables in 81 northern boreal old-growth forest stands in Finland. Species richness and the number of red-listed species were analyzed separately using generalized linear models. Most species were infrequent in the studied landscape and no species was encountered in all stands. The species richness increased with 1) the volume of coarse woody debris (CWD), 2) the mean DBH of CWD and 3) the basal area of living trees. The number of red-listed species increased along the same gradients, but the effect of basal area was not significant. Polypore species richness was significantly lower on western slopes than on flat topography. On average, species richness was higher on northern and eastern slopes than on western and southern slopes. The results suggest that a combination of habitat variables used as indicators may be useful in selecting forest stands to be set aside for polypore species conservation.

AB  - The ability to achieve environmentally sustainable Atlantic salmon aquaculture in coastal fjord ecosystems is currently constrained by our limited knowledge of the regional interactions and fate of organic effluents on benthic ecosystems. A first step in addressing this limitation is to establish predictive modelling tools to better understand local and regional dispersion of organic effluents in the wider ecosystem. By combining settling velocity of faecal waste from different sizes of Atlantic salmon, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with a particle tracking model and farm management data, this study presents a first-generation generic near-and far-field effluent dispersion model to predict the spread of particulate organic waste into fjord ecosystems. Simulations predict that >75% of organic effluents are dispersed to near-field sites (<500 m from the release point), while a small proportion of particulate organic effluents (up to 2.7%) are dispersed to far-field sites (>2 km). These simulations indicate that organic effluents from fish farms may be dispersed over large areas of fjord systems. The input of measured "mass fractions" settling velocities of faecal waste from different sizes of Atlantic salmon ensured that modelled predictions of near and far-field dispersion of organic material over a production cycle were in the range of observed POM fluxes.

AB  - Hardangerfjord is the second largest fjord in Norway and is situated on the southwest coast. During the last century the fjord has been influenced by a variety of anthropogenous activities such as industry, hydro-electrical power plants and since 1980 an increase in fish farming. This study was carried out in order to investigate whether changes in the macroalgal communities of Hardangerfjord have taken place since the 1950s. The macroalgal composition at a number of stations investigated in 2008-2009 was compared to recordings from the same stations during the 1950s. While the distribution and abundance of dominant groups (fucoids, kelps) showed a high resilience when compared to recordings from the 1950s, some changes in the macroalgal communities in the fjord were evident. The present study showed higher species richness and a higher frequency of species with a warm-water affinity. Since the first part of the 1990s an increase in summer sea surface temperatures has taken place in the area, and the observed algal changes suggest a pronounced temperature effect on macroalgal communities. A number of red algal species was observed to protrude further into the fjord in the present study than in the 1950s, probably caused by altered salinity regime due to the electrical power industry.

AB  - Effects of clear-cutting on the ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus community in a Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. forest near Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A., were assessed using molecular techniques. Samples were taken by soil core in both undisturbed and clear-cut sites by randomized block design. Species overlap was compared between clear-cut and undisturbed sites and ascomycete-basidiomycete ratio was determined, using PCR-RFLP methods. Fifty species of EM fungi were detected in the clear-cut sites, the most common being Cenococcum geophilum Fr., Suillus sp., a member of the suilloid group, a Russulaceae species, and a Thelephoraceae species. Sixty-six species were detected in the undisturbed sites, which were dominated by a Suilloid species, a Tricholomataceae species, Cortinarius sp., and Cenococcum geophilum. Species composition in the clear-cut sites differed significantly from that in the undisturbed sites (P = 0.0001). However, 9 of the 14 species most commonly found in the clear-cut sites were also found in the undisturbed sites, but in much lower abundance, while species rank curves of both stand types mirrored each other. There were no significant differences in species richness, root-tip abundance, or ascomycete-basidiomycete ratio between the clear-cut and undisturbed sites. However, species richness was lower in the clear-cut sites than in the undisturbed sites. An overall loss of species richness after clear-cutting and significant changes in species composition indicate that clear-cutting can negatively alter the EM fungal community, and this may have profound effects on ecosystem function.

AB  - Historical radial increment data based on tree ring analyses from the close-to-nature experimental forest management unit Smolnicka Osada in Central Slovakia were used for retrospective modelling of changes in forest dynamics to estimate the sensitivity of management planning goals under climate change. Four example years representing historical periods with typically different species-specific patterns of radial increment in mixed beech-fir-spruce forest (1910, 1950, 1980, and 2014) served as virtual starting points for the modelling. An advanced density-dependent matrix transition model was utilised for modelling stand dynamics. An integrated tool for nonlinear financial optimisation searched for an optimal management equilibrium. In addition to transition probabilities adjusted from increment data, some assumptions for changes in ingrowth and mortality related to the increment, as well as a case study concerning the reduced ingrowth changed by game browsing intensity, were tested for modelling more realistic historical ecological conditions. The sensitivity study revealed changes in the optimal management equilibrium represented by optimal basal area, tree species composition, diameter distribution and target harvest diameter over time due to the adapted ecological modelling. The main lesson of the past for the future is to avoid placing too much trust in the simple extrapolation of current trends, such as the observed continual decline in spruce related to climate change, but to be aware of temporal and possibly reversible processes, such as the observed extensive fir recovery after the reduction of air pollution. Tree species diversity appears to be the best option for the uncertain future.

AB  - Montane (alpine) areas are generally of high value for nature conservation. Such environments and the habitats they support are dynamic and often fragile. They are vulnerable to disturbance from a range of human activities and are responsive to climate changes over short and long timescales. Biodiversity and conservation values are closely linked to geological history, geomorphological processes and soils, and it is crucial that management systems are based on understanding these links.
   There are many similarities between the Cairngorm Mountains (Scotland), the Giant Mountains (Czech Republic) and Abisko Mountains (Sweden) in terms of geology, geomorphology, ecology, links with biodiversity and high conservation importance. Comparable pressures and management issues involve, to varying degrees, a history of human use and impacts from deforestation, pasturing, grazing, recreation and atmospheric pollution. Landscape change therefore involves a complex interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors. Managing such change requires better understanding of the geo-ecological processes involved and the factors that determine landscape sensitivity. This is illustrated through a simple framework and examples from the three areas. Comparison of landscape sensitivity between similar montane areas, but in different geographic locations and climatic environments, should allow more informed management planning and a precautionary approach in advance of further changes in human activity and from predicted global warming scenarios.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) policy encourages the spatial planning of natural and semi-natural areas to deliver biodiversity conservation and a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) important to human well-being. Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes' different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being. The aim of this study is to identify and locate such land cover types as GI that provide multiple ES important for human well-being in rural settings. First, we interviewed 400 urban and rural residents to identify ES important for personal well-being and the land covers that deliver multiple ES in three counties that best represent the existing rural-urban gradient in Sweden. Second, to support the inclusion of GI in spatial planning, we identified and located spatial concentrations of individual land covers providing multiple ES (GI hubs) and significant clusters of such land covers (GI hotspots). The majority of urban and rural respondents associated their well-being with lakes, mountains above the tree line, old-growth forests, wooded-pastures, mature pine forests and rural farmsteads. The areal proportion of each type of hub was low, on average 3.5%. At least three land management strategies are needed to sustain GI hubs: maintenance of the composition, structure and function of natural ecosystems in protected areas; support for traditional agroforestry and villages as social-ecological systems; and diversification of the current intensive forest management approach.

AB  - Knowledge of variation in vascular plant species richness and species composition in modern agricultural landscapes is important for appropriate biodiversity management. From species lists for 2201 land-type patches in 16 1-km(2) plots five data sets differing in sampling-unit size from patch to plot were prepared. Variation in each data set was partitioned into seven sources: patch geometry, patch type, geographic location, plot affiliation, habitat diversity, ecological factors, and land-use intensity. Patch species richness was highly predictable (75% of variance explained) by patch area, within-patch heterogeneity and patch type. Plot species richness was, however, not predictable by any explanatory variable, most likely because all studied landscapes contained all main patch types - ploughed land, woodland, grassland and other open land - and hence had a large core of common species. Patch species composition was explained by variation along major environmental complex gradients but appeared nested to lower degrees in modern than in traditional agricultural landscapes because species-poor parts of the landscape do not contain well-defined subsets of the species pool of species-rich parts. Variation in species composition was scale dependent because the relative importance of specific complex gradients changed with increasing sampling-unit size, and because the amount of randomness in data sets decreased with increasing sampling-unit size. Our results indicate that broad landscape structural changes will have consequences for landscape-scale species richness that are hard or impossible to predict by simple surrogate variables.

AB  - Mountain forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and protection from natural hazards. Forest cover in the European Alps has increased over the last century, but in recent years, these forests have experienced an increasing rate of natural disturbances by agents such as windthrow, bark beetle outbreaks, and forest fires. These disturbances pose a challenge for forest management, making it important to understand how site and stand characteristics, land use legacies and recent management influence disturbance probability. We combined a dataset of forest disturbances detected from space with in-situ forest management records, allowing us to differentiate between different types of disturbances for the Canton of Graubunden, Switzerland, in the years 2005-2018. The resulting dataset of over 28'000 attributed disturbance patches (corresponding to a disturbed forest area of ca. 23'600 ha) was combined with information on topography, forest structure, and historical forest cover. A machine-learning approach was used to investigate the non-linear and interacting relationships between potential drivers and disturbance occurrence. Natural disturbances (especially windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks) were most common at lower elevations, on shallow and south-facing slopes, and in even-aged, spruce-dominated stands with a closed canopy. Forests established in the 20th century were significantly more susceptible to natural disturbances than forests that were already present before 1880, which may be due to the uniform age and vertical structure of secondary forests, as well as legacy effects of former agricultural use. On the other hand, forest management more often took place in forests present before 1880. Management interventions (such as thinning) in turn increased the susceptibility to natural disturbances in the short term. This finding emphasizes the need to balance short-term increases in disturbance susceptibility with long-term benefits in forest resilience when planning management interventions in mountain forests. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple interactive drivers, including management and land-use history, for understanding forest disturbance regimes.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship of seed bank and field seedlings on the structure of standing vegetation. We also studied the roles in sexual regeneration of seed size, diaspore morphology, and the ability to regenerate vegetatively. Seed banks, field seedlings, and standing vegetation were sampled in 8 subarctic plant communities in Kilpisjarvi, Finland, in, 1995-1998. The seed bank densities varied from 99 to, 1109 viable seeds m(2-1) and decreased toward higher altitudes. The seed bank densities were significantly larger than the field seedling densities in the closed vegetation of the lower slopes, whereas the differences were smaller in the open, late-melting snowbeds on higher slopes. The species that occurred only in the seed bank had small seeds or appendaged diaspores. The field seedling densities were high in plant communities dominated by species with ineffective vegetative reproduction or by species with diaspores and with pappus. The floristic similarity was low between the seed bank, field seedlings, and standing vegetation. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that the species diversity was lower in the seed banks than in standing vegetation and field seedlings. The results indicate that all transitions equally constrain the sexual regeneration of vegetation. Clonality, very small and very large seed sizes, appendaged diaspores, and possibly narrow first leaves in seedlings are traits that limit the transition of plants from standing vegetation to the phase of field seedlings via seed bank. Persistent seed bank has a minor role compared to clonal growth in the regulation of vegetation structure.

AB  - Clearance of understory to enhance the recreational value of the forest is common in urban woodlands. Open forests are generally perceived as safe and pleasant, but clearance is likely to be negative for woodland birds as the shrub layer is important for foraging and protection. In this 3-year experiment with a before after control impact (BACI) design, the effects from understory clearance on woodland bird abundance and diversity in five suburban broadleaved forests in south-western Sweden were studied. Understory clearance was either made in regular patches, with 50% removal of understory, or as "Complete" (90%) removal. Adjacent stands of equal size were left unmanaged as controls. Woodland birds and understory vegetation were surveyed before and after the management. The total density of breeding forest birds decreased in the plots with "Complete" removal of the understory compared to plots with "Patchy" clearance. "Patchy" clearance had no significant effect on bird density. Bird diversity was not affected by the management. Woodland birds are highly valued animals in urban green areas and the impact on bird fauna should therefore be taken into consideration in the development of management plans for urban woodlands. The present study has demonstrated that clearance of understory can have negative effects on bird abundance if carried out over large areas. Clearance in patches was not found to have negative effects on bird abundance and can promote recreational values by increasing visibility and structural variation of the forest.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

AB  - This study presents a new data synthesis of Finnish peatland area and carbon (C) store in peat from 1950 to 2015. We present updated results from the most comprehensive compilation of Finnish peat soil properties with associated C accumulation rates from undrained mires and C sources from different forms of anthropogenic land use. Since 1950, different forms of land use of Finnish peatlands have reduced the total peat C store by 3-10%, approximately 172-510 Tg. The most significant C losses have occurred from forestry-drained peatlands, but significant losses have also occurred from agricultural peat soils, peat extraction, and other forms of peatland exploitation such as building water reservoirs. However, the C accumulation of undrained mires and especially the increased biomass production of drained peatlands have partly compensated for the anthropogenic C losses. The total C store of peatland vegetation biomass (trees, seedlings, ground vegetation, detritus and below-ground roots) was estimated to have increased by 92 Tg due to intensive peatland drainage. The present total C store of Finnish peatland ecosystems was estimated at 5618 Tg, which includes 5079 Tg as peat. The total C store estimate is approximately 1-7 % lower compared to the 1950s. Today, the undrained mires still represent a significant national C sink, with the rate of C sequestration estimated at 0.82 Tg yr(-1). However, across all land uses the present peat soil is a C source by 3.7-10.0 Tg yr(-1). Significant anthropogenic C losses from peat soil underline the urgent need for sustainable C management of all peatlands, including the preservation of the C store in existing natural mires, stopping land clearing on undisturbed organic soils, and improving the peatland hydrology by restoration to create long-term C sinks especially within the large unproductive drainage area and northern aapa mire area.

AB  - Mismatching in the spatial scales of social structures and ecological processes complicates the management of natural resources. Here we suggest the use of variance components to determine at which spatial scale variation in feelings, environmental attitudes and value orientation is largest and hence most exposed to conflicts. We estimated the variance components of the feeling of fear for large carnivores, environmental attitudes towards large carnivores and environmental value orientation at 3 scales (municipality, county and country) in Norway and Sweden. The feeling of fear for specific carnivores had the highest variance components at the municipality level, we found no specific scale that best explained the variance in attitudes towards carnivores in general, while attitudes based on environmental value orientation showed the highest variance components at the country level. To match the social-ecological systems, we conclude that management units have to be designed as the best possible trade-off between the social and ecological scales; i.e. largest possible to maintain ecological sustainability, but small enough to maintain a low degree of social conflicts.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the bio-based economy, evident in the policy domain as well as in the academic literature. Its proponents consider it an opportunity to address multiple societal challenges, and the concept has broad reach across different sectors of society. However, a potential transition process is also linked to areas of risk and uncertainty, and the need for interdisciplinary research and for the identification of potential trade-offs and synergies between parallel visions of the bio-based economy have been emphasized. The aim of this paper is to contribute to addressing this gap by using an approach combining tools for systems analysis with expert interviews. Focusing specifically on dynamics in the agricultural sector in Sweden, an integrated understanding of the social and ecological processes contributing to or hindering a transition in this area is developed, high order leverage points are identified, and potential impacts of proposed interventions explored. The paper also considers cross-sectoral linkages between the forestry and agricultural sectors.

AB  - The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxyl free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation.

AB  - Cultivation of perennial crops can be an option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils. To determine the carbon budget of a perennial cropping system under the boreal climate, we studied carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange of timothy and meadow fescue mixture (TIM) on a boreal mineral soil. Based on the mean annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), TIM was a sink for both CO2 (-1000 g CO2 m(-2)) and CH4 (-140 mg CH4 m(-2)). In comparison, soil without vegetation (BARE) was a source of CO2 (1300 g CO2 m(-2)). Based on the literature review, the net CO2 uptake of TIM was similar to the perennial cropping systems in northern Finland but higher than that of the annual cropping systems in this region. Our multi-year study shows that the perennial cultivation system based on TIM is an environmentally sustainable land-use option to mitigate agricultural CO2 emissions in regions with short growing seasons.

AB  - Nitrogen availability limits growth inmost boreal forests. However, parts of the boreal zone receive significant levels of nitrogen deposition. At the same time, forests are fertilized to increase volume growth and carbon sequestration. No matter the source, increasing nitrogen in the boreal forest ecosystem will influence the resource situation for its primary producers, the plants, with possible implications for their defensive chemistry. In general, fertilization reduces phenolic compound concentrations in trees, but existing evidence mainly comes from studies on young plants. Given the role of the phenolic compounds in protection against herbivores and other forest pests, it is important to know if phenolics are reduced with fertilization also in mature trees. The evergreen Norway spruce is long-lived, and it is reasonable that defensive strategies could change from the juvenile to the reproductive and mature phases. In addition, as the needles are kept for several years, defense could also change with needle age. We sampled current and previous year needles from an N fertilization experiment in a Norway spruce forest landscape in south-central Norway to which N had been added annually for 13 years. We analyzed total nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), as well as low-molecular phenolics and condensed tannins. Needles from fertilized trees had higher N than those from controls plots, and fertilization decreased concentrations of many flavonoids, as well as condensed tannins in current year needles. In previous year needles, some stilbenes and condensed tannins were higher in fertilized trees. In control trees, the total phenolic concentration was almost five times as high in previous year needles compared with those from the current year, and there were great compositional differences. Previous year needles contained highest concentrations of acetophenone and stilbenes, while in the current year needles the flavonoids, and especially coumaroyl-astragalins dominated. Condensed tannins did not differ between current and previous year needles from control trees. In conclusion, the phenolic defense of current year needles of mature P. abies trees was strongly changed upon fertilization. This may imply that nitrogen deposition and forest fertilization leave forests less robust in a time when pests may take advantages of a changing climate.

AB  - 1. To create high-stumps (snags) is a common conservation action during final felling in Swedish production forests. However, many wood-living beetle species are only found in certain areas with higher overall biodiversity, so called hotspots. It has been argued that it is efficient to concentrate conservation efforts to hotspots.
   2. The saproxylic beetle fauna was sampled on ten clearcuts inside hotspots and ten clearcuts outside the hotspots. They were collected with window traps mounted on 2- and 4-year-old spruce and birch high-stumps. We also used environmental data (e.g. tree species composition) to confirm differences between the surroundings of two, the clearcut types.
   3. High-stumps on the hotspot clearcuts did not attract more saproxylic beetle species, or red-listed species, than high-stumps outside the hotspots. The environmental data showed that the clearcuts differed in several important aspects, for instance, were there a higher proportion of broadleaved trees around the hotspot compared with the clearcuts outside the hotspots. In a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the proportion of coniferous and broadleaved forest was an important explanatory variables. The hotspot variable did contribute significantly in explaining the beetle composition on the birch high-stumps, but not on the spruce high-stumps.
   4. In general, the study suggests that concentrating high-stumps to hotspot areas will not benefit more species. However, the result indicates birch high-stumps could be prioritised in a biologically rich landscape. The hotspot effect may be more noticeable in the future as the high-stumps decay and their importance for late successional species increase.

AB  - The use of open sea fish cage systems for salmon production in Norway and elsewhere may cause increasing environmental challenges regarding pests, biodiversity and pollution. These problems may be avoided by using land-based fish farms, where effluent quantity and quality are controlled. However, there are several obstacles treating wastewaters from fish farms. This paper presents a theoretical mass balance approach for an experimental land-based salmon farm with a capacity of 780 t fish per year in Orland (64 degrees N), Norway, with particular emphasis on the potential of wastewater treatment with microalgae production. Post microfiltration of the particulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) from the wastewater supplies, approximately 24 t dissolved N and 3 t dissolved P are available for microalgae production per annum. A mean on-site annual photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 265 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) could theoretically yield approximately 100-140 t dry microalgae per hectare and year, thereby sequestering 7-10 t N und 1 t P ha(-1) yr(-1). Thus the entire N and P neutralization from wastewater would require an approximately 3 ha large area. Light is interestingly not a limiting factor, even in Northern Norway. However, with an estimated water effluent flux rate of 1.7 m(3) s(-1) the main challenge is an optimal balance between bioreactor surface exposed to light, water flow, residence time, and nutrient concentrations.

AB  - Boreal forest management has changed rapidly during recent years, and new forestry practices, such as green tree retention (GTR), which aim at ecological sustainability have been developed. With our present knowledge. we cannot fully assess the ecological benefits of prevailing Fennoscandian GTR levels(5-10 trees/ha). Small retention tree groups cannot be expected to provide habitat for interior Forest species because of edge effects. However. even individual trees will increase the amount of snags and logs, which are important habitats for many species. According to our own results, the response of understory vegetation depends clearly on retention level. With 7% retention of stand volume, or about 50 trees per ha, we found no remarkable differences in vegetation response as compared with clear-felling. This indicates that a higher level of retention is needed to maintain late successional plant species on the site. Our data also show that there is much within-stand type variation, which correlates with the amount of CWD and stand characteristics. By locating larger retention tree groups in species-rich areas, and avoiding disturbance to CWD, a higher proportion of the resident species diversity may be "lifeboated" over the regeneration phase on the stand level. In this paper we review existing literature on green tree retention, with special emphasis on Fennoscandian forest management, biodiversity and productivity issues. We present results of two ongoing Finnish experimental studies that Focus on the effects of various forestry practices on understory vegetation including epixylic taxa.

AB  - The biochar-agriculture nexus can potentially generate several benefits ranging from soil carbon sequestration to the reduction in nutrient leaching from arable soils. However, leveraging these benefits requires spatially-explicit information on suitable locations for biochar application. This study provides a flexible multicriteria framework that delivers spatial indications on biochar prioritization through a biochar use indication map (BUIM). The framework was exemplified as a case study for Swedish arable land through three different prioritization nar-ratives. The BUIM for all the narratives revealed that a significant fraction of the Swedish arable land could potentially benefit from biochar application. Furthermore, arable land that scored high for a given narrative did not necessarily score high in the others, thus indicating that biochar application schemes can be adjusted to various objectives and local needs. The framework presented here aims to promote the exploration of different avenues for deploying biochar in the agricultural sector.

AB  - Aim Many thematic land cover maps, such as maps of vegetation types, are based on field inventories. Studies show inconsistencies among field workers in such maps, explained by inter-observer variation in classification and/or spatial delineation of polygons. In this study, we have tested a new method to assess the accuracy of these two components independently. Location Four study sites dominated by different ecosystems in southeast Norway. Methods We have used a vegetation-based land cover classification system adapted to a map scale of 1:5,000. First, a consensus map, a map that can be considered an approximation of a flawless map, was established. Secondly, the consensus map was adapted to test the accuracy of classification and polygon delineation independently. We used 10 field workers to generate a consensus map, and 14 new field workers (in pairs) to test the accuracy (n = 7). Results The results show that the accuracy of polygon delineation is lower than that of land cover classification. This is in contrast with previous studies, but previous research designs have not enabled a separation of the two accuracy components. Conclusion We recommend strengthening the training and harmonization of field workers in general, and increasing the emphasis on polygon delineation.

AB  - The biodiversity of species-rich semi-natural meadows is declining across Europe due to ceased management. In this study we aimed to find out how successfully the local species richness of an overgrown semi-natural mesic meadow could be restored by sheep grazing after a long period of abandonment. The cover of vascular plant species in grazed plots and ungrazed exclosures was studied for five years and the responses of different functional plant groups were followed (herbs vs grasses, tall vs short species, species differing in flowering time, species representing different Grime's CSR strategies and species indicative of rich vs poor soil). Grazing increased species number by nearly 30%. On grazed plots the litter cover practically disappeared, favouring small herbs such as Rhinanthus minor, Ranunculus acris, Trifolium pratense and the grass Agrostis capillaris. Grazing decreased the cover of the late flowering tall herb Epilobium angustifolium but had no effect on the abundance of the early flowering tall herbs Anthriscus sylvestris or Geranium sylvaticum. We suggest that to succeed in restoration it is useful to determine the responses of different functional plant groups to grazing. Grassland managers need this information to optimize the methods and timing of management used in restoration. Additional management practices, such as mowing, may be needed in mesic meadows to decrease the dominance of tall species. The availability of propagules seemed to restrict further increase of species richness in our study area.

AB  - The understorey vascular plant cover and its relations with the overstorey tree species and site properties in young silver birch and hybrid aspen plantations were studied. Understorey vegetation was similar in both plantation types in terms of species richness, diversity, sensitivity to human impact, life-span and habitat preference. Nevertheless, in denser silver birch plantations some signs indicated a faster vegetation development overall, e.g., a higher share of shade tolerant plant species. The concentration of total N was higher in the humus layer of silver birch plantations consequently affecting the nutritional status of the understorey vegetation. The significant impact of the plantation type on the understorey vegetation was confirmed by the NMDS analysis. The hypothesis that semi-exotic hybrid aspen plantations may support the spread of alien species or may show a tendency towards smaller indigenous species richness was not confirmed. Irrespective of the overstorey tree species, a strong previous land use impact, i.e. disturbance history, on the ground vegetation was eminent.

AB  - Retention of logging residue as dead wood could be a method to simultaneously increase biodiversity and predation rates of pest insects, in managed forests. Managed forests are generally low in diversity, and dead wood has been demonstrated to increase species diversity. Moreover, managed forests are predicted to suffer from higher frequency of insect outbreaks in the future, particularly in the northern hemisphere. In this study, we explore the effect of dead wood removal and addition in managed pine forest stands in Sweden on arthropod diversity and abundance and predation rates. We performed a controlled field experiment, focusing on logging residue type of dead wood. We used pitfall traps and sticky traps to measure arthropod diversity and abundance and plasticine larvae to assess predation rates. We specifically targeted generalist arthropods (i.e. non-wood living species), and predation rate on tree-dwelling larvae (corresponding to defoliating outbreak pests). We found no effect of dead wood addition on arthropod abundance or diversity, neither did we find an effect on predation rate. Despite the lack of effects in our study, we argue that dead wood can be an important component for both biodiversity of generalist arthropod and for pest control, but the effect may depend on both the specific arthropod group targeted and the specific life stage of the pest insect as well as on inherent components of the dead wood, such as age.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) stock can be increased by agricultural management, but is subject to various factors. The extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential, as well as the controlling factors, under different climate and management practices across a region or country are important for policy-makers and land managers, however have been rarely known.OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential over 2021-2040 under different scenarios of climate change and Sustainable Soil Management (SSM) practices, and quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM practices on the SOC sequestration potential, for croplands across Finland at a spatial resolution of 1 km.METHODS: RothC model is run iteratively to equilibrium to calculate the size of the SOC pools and the annual plant carbon inputs. Then, it is applied to investigate the SOC sequestration potential over 2021-2040 under different scenarios of climate change and SSM practices. Finally, facorial simulation experiments are conducted to quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM practices, alone and in combination, on SOC sequestration potential.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Under the combined impacts of climate change and SSM practices, the SOC sequestration potential during 2021-2040 relative to 2020 will be on average - 0.03, 0.007, 0.05, and 0.13 t C ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, with carbon input being business as usual, 5%, 10%, and 20% increase. This is equivalent to an annual change rate of -0.04%, 0.009%, 0.07%, and 0.17%, respectively. Therefore, a 20% increase in C input to soil will not be enough to obtain a 4%o increase per year over the 20-year period in Finland. Carbon input will promote SOC sequestration potential; however, climate change will reduce it on average by 0.28 t C ha- 1 yr- 1. Across the cropland in Finland, on average, the relative contributions of C input, temperature, and precipitation to SOC sequestration potential in 2021-2040 will be 56%, 24%, and 20%, respectively, however there is a spatially explicit pattern. The SOC sequestration potential will be relatively high and dominated by C input in west and southwest Finland. By contrast, it will be relatively low and dominated by climate in north and east Finland, and the central part of southern Finland.SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide the information as to where, how much, and which SSM practices could be applied for enhancing SOC sequestration at a high spatial resolution, which is essential for stakeholders to increase cropland SOC sequestration efficiently.

AB  - Buffer zones in agroecosystems are maintained to prevent soil erosion, nutrient leaching and pesticide drift from arable fields. Buffer zones are also semi-natural habitats supporting wildlife in farmland. At the landscape level, buffer zones may also function as corridors in agricultural mosaics. This study aims at understanding the relationship between spatial structure of buffer zones and floral species richness. These are linear landscape elements for which the area is approximated by the product of length and width. The species-area relationship (S = cA(z)) was revised, accordingly, and it was found that patch width was the most effective spatial indicator for species richness in buffer zones. The modified species-area model emphasised the species-area relationship and the importance of width in buffer zone design in an agricultural landscape. It was concluded that there is no unique best-fit model of species-area for both natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Especially in agricultural landscapes, in which habitat heterogeneity is introduced by agricultural activities, the species-area model must be reconsidered accordingly. Some possible factors accounting for the results were discussed. It was suggested that the increase in species diversity with an increase in width of the buffer zone may be due to cross-sectional habitat gradients within the linear patches. The result can be used for optimising buffer zones to meet the needs of biodiversity conservation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat loss is a major cause of species decline and extinction. Immediately after habitat loss, species occurrences are not in equilibrium with the new landscape and more closely reflect the previous landscape structure. Species with slow colonisation-extinction dynamics may display long time-lags before reaching a new equilibrium. We investigated the importance of connectivity to current and historical dispersal sources with the aim of explaining the occurrence pattern of epiphytic lichens with different traits among 104 old oaks. We used oak survey data collected from 1830 and 2009 for a Swedish landscape where oak densities declined drastically shortly after 1830. We fitted a commonly used connectivity measure and estimated the confidence interval for the spatial scale parameter. Small differences in the spatial scale parameter resulted in large differences in model fit. Connectivity to trees in 1830 better explained the occurrence of three of the four species compared to the connectivity in 2009. The explanatory power of the historical landscape structure was highest for the species with traits that may result in a low colonisation rate-both a narrow niche (here few suitable trees) and large dispersal propagules. The results suggest that oak-dependent epiphytic lichens have not reached equilibrium with the spatial landscape structure 180 years after the drastic decline in habitat. For the long-term persistence of epiphytes associated with old trees, conservation efforts should focus on (1) protecting and restoring stands where specialised species with large dispersal propagules (i.e. with low colonisation rates) occur today and (2) promoting tree regeneration in their near vicinity.

AB  - From 1941-1944 nearly 30 phytosociological releves were completed by F. K. Hartmann in the Rychlebske Mountains, a typical mountainous area in northeastern Czech Republic. Of the original plots still covered with adult grown beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, 22 were resampled in 1998 and 1999. In order to describe the recent vegetation variability of the sites 57 releves were recorded. Changes in vegetation were estimated using relative changes in species density and ordinations (PCA, RDA). Environmental changes were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values when no direct measurements were available. A decline in species diversity has been documented, particularly, many species occurring frequently in deciduous forests with nutrient and moisture well-supplied soils around neutral have decreased. In contrast, several light-demanding, acid- and soil desiccation-tolerant species have increased. Natural succession, quantified as forest age, contributed slightly to these changes. In Ellenberg indicator values, a decline in F (soil moisture), R (soil calcium) and N (ecosystem productivity), and an increase in L (understorey light) were shown. This is interpreted as the influence of modified forestry management and of airborne pollutants. Intensified logging caused the canopy to open and soil conditions to worsen. The latter is most likely also due to acid leaching of soil cations (Ca, K, Na). This caused a decline in soil productivity, thus the effect of nitrification could not be detected. The original releves may have differed in size influencing the results.

AB  - Invasive rats (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, R. exulans) have large impacts on island habitats through both direct and indirect effects on plants. Rats affect vegetation by extirpating burrowing seabirds through consumption of eggs, chicks, and adults. These seabirds serve as ecosystem engineers, affecting plant communities by burying and trampling seeds and seedlings, and by altering microclimate. Rats also directly affect plant communities by consuming seeds and seedlings. We studied the direct and indirect impacts of rats on the seedlings of woody plants on 21 islands in northern New Zealand. We compared seedling densities and richness on islands which differed in status with respect to rats: nine islands where rats never invaded, seven islands where rats were present at the time of our study, and five islands where rats were either eradicated or where populations were likely to be small as a result of repeated eradications and re-invasions. In addition, we compared plots from a subset of the 21 islands with different burrow densities to examine the effects of burrowing seabirds on plants while controlling for other factors that differ between islands. We categorized plant communities by species composition and seedling density in a cluster analysis. We found that burrow densities explained more variation in seedling communities than rat status. In areas with high seabird burrow density seedling densities were low, especially for the smallest seedlings. Species richness and diversity of seedlings, but not seedling density, were most influenced by changes in microclimate induced by seabirds. Islands where rats had been eradicated or that had low rat populations had the lowest diversity and richness of seedlings (and adults), but the highest seedling density. Seedling communities on these islands were dominated by Pseudopanax lessonii and Coprosma macrocarpa. This indicates lasting effects of rats that may prevent islands from returning to pre-invasion states.

AB  - Intraspecific genetic variation can have similar effects as species diversity on ecosystem function; understanding such variation is important, particularly for ecological key species. The brown trout plays central roles in many northern freshwater ecosystems, and several cases of sympatric brown trout populations have been detected in freshwater lakes based on apparent morphological differences. In some rare cases, sympatric, genetically distinct populations lacking visible phenotypic differences have been detected based on genetic data alone. Detecting such "cryptic" sympatric populations without prior grouping of individuals based on phenotypic characteristics is more difficult statistically, though. The aim of the present study is to delineate the spatial connectivity of two cryptic, sympatric genetic clusters of brown trout discovered in two interconnected, tiny subarctic Swedish lakes. The structures were detected using allozyme markers, and have been monitored over time. Here, we confirm their existence for almost three decades and report that these cryptic, sympatric populations exhibit very different connectivity patterns to brown trout of nearby lakes. One of the clusters is relatively isolated while the other one shows high genetic similarity to downstream populations. There are indications of different spawning sites as reflected in genetic structuring among parr from different creeks. We used > 3000 SNPs on a subsample and find that the SNPs largely confirm the allozyme pattern but give considerably lower F (ST) values, and potentially indicate further structuring within populations. This type of complex genetic substructuring over microgeographical scales might be more common than anticipated and needs to be considered in conservation management.

AB  - Stump wood is used to produce electricity and heat, especially in Finland, where biomass-based energy plays a major role. This study, which aims to investigate the social acceptance of stump harvesting for bioenergy production in Finland, was conducted in two stages: a questionnaire-based study and a subsequent literature-based study. The latter provides information concerning the beneficial or harmful consequences of stump harvesting, and this information could be used to gain support for stump harvesting's use or abandonment by stakeholders of forest utilisation. The questionnaire survey was conducted in 2013 at the SILVA fair organised by the Association of Finnish Forestry centre in Joensuu, Finland, and the literature-based study was conducted in 2018. Six social groups were defined: higher administrative, lower administrative, skilled or specialized workers, farm and forestry workers, students, and others. The results of the questionnaire revealed that, although different social groups are highly interested in using stump wood for energy purposes, respondents think that stump harvesting will not be able to raise their incomes. Respondents are also unmotivated, with even forestry workers expressing critical views on the promotion of stump harvesting for energy purposes due to the environmental consequences. The literature-based study revealed that scientific results on stump harvesting are contradictory. It is crucial to involve different social groups and to reflect on their opinions regarding the use of stump wood as a forest management tool and for bioenergy production. As Finland moves toward a bioeconomy, the study of social acceptance of stump harvesting will direct the development of stump harvesting for bioenergy production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The re-stocking or enhancement of Homarid populations has been the focus of several research projects in recent years. However, despite being able to successfully rear lobsters in captivity, there are few reports of newly settled European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) in the wild. This is of serious concern for fishery managers when trying to ascertain if restocking or enhancement programmes are successful at the fishery level. Based on published work from the western Atlantic seaboard, cobble and boulder substrata have been identified as an important nursery habitat for early benthic phase (EBP) American lobsters (Homarus americanus). This paper, based on an E.U. funded research project (LEAR), describes the results of quantitative airlift suction sampling from cobble habitat in Norway, Ireland the U.K., and Italy. In total, 67 m(2) of cobble was sampled, but no EBP lobsters were found. Overall, crustaceans and molluscs were the most abundant species in all countries. While the collective densities of animals per m(2) of cobble were similar to that of the United States, the species diversity in Europe was noticeably higher. Among the crustacea, the reptant decapods dominated at all sites. These findings tend to support the modern day 'exclusion hypothesis' that competition and predation from other species limits the successful recruitment of EBP European lobster to the benthos. The results highlight the need to go beyond the single species approach to understanding the factors that influence the recruitment of Homarus gammarus.

AB  - 1. We conducted a new single-site study and a meta-analysis of pre-existing studies from multiple streams to assess whether intraspecific aggregation among leaf packs promotes coexistence among leaf-eating invertebrates (shredders) in Swedish streams.
   2. In the single-site study, 48 standardised leaf bags were exposed for 1 month for shredder colonisation in a homogeneous glide of a forested stream. Current velocity, water depth and substratum composition were additionally assessed to investigate how these factors affected shredder distributions.
   3. The meta-analysis included information on shredder colonisation of leaf packs from seven other studies of detritus decomposition to assess patterns of aggregation. Intra- and interspecific aggregation and their relative strength were assessed using indices (J, C and A respectively) originally developed for terrestrial insects also dependent on patchy and ephemeral resources.
   4. In both parts of the study, intraspecific aggregation was much stronger than interspecific aggregation, which was weak overall, indicating that the conditions under which aggregation is expected to facilitate coexistence were fulfilled in our shredder assemblages.
   5. In the single-site study, shredder abundances were weakly associated with environmental variables suggesting that habitat heterogeneity only partly explains aggregation patterns.
   6. Our results strongly suggest that shredder diversity in streams, particularly during periods of leaf limitation (such as might occur in spring), is promoted by the aggregation of individual species among patches of resource.

AB  - Increasing landscape heterogeneity and organic farming practices are known to enhance species richness in agroecosystems. However, little is known about the consequences of these management options on other biodiversity components such as community composition, phylogenetic structure and functional diversity which may be more closely linked to ecosystem functioning. We surveyed semi-natural plant communities within the uncultivated field margins of 18 arable farms in Skane, south Sweden. We investigated how taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity responds to landscape heterogeneity (presence of semi-natural habitat) and farm management intensity (organic vs. conventional farming). Plant species richness and functional diversity metrics all responded positively to landscape heterogeneity, with the strongest effect occurring on conventional farms. Community composition differed with farm management, and mean phylogenetic relatedness, an indicator of phylogenetic structure, was significantly higher on the field margins of organic compared to conventional farms. Individual plant functional groups themselves responded in unique ways to land management and landscape heterogeneity.Synthesis and applications. Management strategies that promote the conservation of heterogeneous landscapes (i.e. a higher proportion of semi-natural habitats) and organic farm management practices are important for maintaining plant phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity in agroecosystems. Accommodating various forms of diversity is important to ensure that ecosystems have the greatest possible array of species ecologies'. Such measures will help to improve the capacity of these ecosystems to provide multiple ecosystem functions, including the sustaining and regulating services of benefit to people.

The pure stands were mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The mixtures were composed of beech with either Douglas fir or spruce. The stands were located in two regions with different soil conditions.ResultsOur results indicated that pure spruce stands, independent of site condition, had the lowest base saturation while beech showed the highest values. The impact of Douglas fir differed between site conditions. On sandy soils, there was higher pH and base saturation under Douglas fir than under spruce. On loamy soils, however, the pH under Douglas fir and beech was lower than under spruce. The cation stocks (Ca and Mg) on sandy soils were lower under spruce and spruce/beech stands than under Douglas fir and beech. In contrast, under loamy soil, exchangeable Ca and Mg stocks were less under beech than under spruce stands. Soil exchangeable K under mixed stands was among the highest compared to pure stands, independent of site condition.ConclusionsMixed species stands reduce soil base cation depletion compared to conifer stands.ImplicationsAdmixture of Douglas fir to European beech seems to be a more reasonable option for forest management than an admixture of spruce, since it does not negatively affect soil chemistry.

AB  - Supportive breeding with subsequent stocking is an important long-term conservation tool for sustaining harvestable populations and genetic diversity in wild fish populations. In salmonids, this strategy often implies, inadvertently or for logistic reasons, breeding of a mixture of local populations, which may lead to loss of local adaptation and pose risks to receiving populations. In an alpine lake system in Norway (Palsbu-Tunhovd), we assessed long-term effects of interbreeding three brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations from separate and environmentally contrasting spawning and recruitment habitats. Using a Bayesian genetic assignment algorithm we compared numeric contributions and genetic and demographic characteristics of wild-born and lake-stocked fish within and across populations. Population contribution by the broodstock was disproportional to the number of surviving and reproductively ready stocked brown trout, indicating higher lifetime survival for brown trout descending from a large river dominated by large fish. Life history selection was further indicated by a discrepancy between observed and expected numbers of adult hybrids, i.e., fewer hybrids suggest negative fitness effects of hybridization. Hence, supportive breeding changed gene frequencies, although reduced genetic variation was not documented in mature stocked brown trout. Post stocking, these fish retained the initial length advantage relative to the fastest-growing wild-born population until the age of ten. Stocked brown trout had similar growth rates regardless of genetic origin, whereas wild-born brown trout growth rates differed among recruitment habitats. Our study in this system indicates that genetic origin determined longevity. Genetics may be a less important determinant for growth rates in lake-stocked than in wild-born brown trout.

AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to debates on the potential for conservation planning to engage actively with conflict. Current research in conservation planning generally approaches conflict by concentrating on the challenges of securing agreement and consensus. Recent planning literature advocates approaches that are more open to conflict. In the analysis of a Norwegian regional planning process for wild reindeer conservation, we examine how planning authorities handled conflict, and in particular how planning documents portrayed conflicts expressed during the planning process. Findings show that the aim of reaching regional consensus limited the scope of planning, and led to the exclusion of difficult issues and opposing views. Instead of engaging actively with conflict, the planning authority framed opposing positions as unplannable, and failed to recognise them as legitimate. This contributed to weakening of the legitimacy of the regional plan when put to the test.

AB  - In this study we examined how the variation in the distribution of six species of seabird trematodes was influenced by human activities along the subarctic Barents Sea coast of northern Norway. This was done by comparing the prevalence of the parasites in two species of intermediate host (Littorina saxatilis and Littorina obtusata) on seashores near fishing industry complexes, fish farms and at control sites. In L. saxatilis there were higher prevalences at sites influenced by human activities for three out of five trematode species (Microphallus piriformes, M. similis, Cryptocotyle lingua) which have gulls (Larus spp.) as their predominant final hosts, while in L. obtusata, only M. similis was more common at sites with human activity. For M. pygmaeus, a trematode which has the common elder (Somateria mollissima) as its most predominant final host, the prevalence in L. saxatilis tended to be higher at sites with fishing industry, but differences were not significant. No such tendency was found in L. obtusata for this trematode. The overall prevalence in L. obtusata was lower than in L. saxatilis. This indicates that the vulnerability to trematode infection differs between the two snail species depending on the variation in the distribution patterns in the intertidal zone. Gulls tend to concentrate in areas near fishing industry and fish farms to feed on fish offal, which leads to an increase in the transmission between hosts, and to a higher level of parasite infection, locally.

AB  - Dachigam National Park (DNP), in Zabarwan mountains of north-western Himalaya constitutes a region of high biodiversity with greater endemism. DNP is known for its unique micro-climate together with distinct vegetational zones providing home to variety of threatened and endemic plant, animal, and bird species. However, studies on soil microbial diversity in fragile ecosystems of north-western Himalaya in general and DNP in particular are lacking. This was thus a maiden attempt to study variations in soil bacterial diversity of DNP with respect to changing soil physico-chemical properties, vegetation, and altitude. Soil parameters depicted significant variations among different sites with highest values for temperature, OC, OM and TN being 22.2 +/- 0.75 degrees C, 6.53 +/- 0.32%, 11.25 +/- 0.54%, 0.545 +/- 0.04% from site-2 (low altitudinal grassland site) in summer and lowest of 5.1 +/- 0.65 degrees C, 1.24 +/- 0.26%, 2.14 +/- 0.45% and 0.132 +/- 0.04% at site-9 (high altitudinal mixed pine site) in winter. Bacterial CFU showed significant correlations with soil physico-chemical attributes. This study led to the isolation and identification of 92 morphologically varied bacteria with the highest (15) from site-2 and lowest (04) from site-9 which post BLAST analysis (via 16S rRNA analysis) depicted presence of only 57 distinct bacterial species under taxonomic phylum, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Nine species were widely spread (i.e., isolated from > 3 sites), however, most bacteria (37) were restricted to a particular site. Diversity indices ranged between 1.380 to 2.631 (Shannon-Weiner's index); 0.747 to 0.923 (Simpson's index) with highest values for site-2 and lowest for site-9. Index of similarity was highest (47.1%) between riverine sites (site-3 and site-4) whereas two mixed pine sites (site-9 and site-10) showed no similarity.

AB  - ContextIn northern Europe, changes in forest ecosystem structures are commonly attributed to the ubiquitous impact of modern forestry. However, the starting point for modern forestry was not a pristine forest, but landscapes influenced for centuries by diverse human activities.ObjectivesOur aims were to (1) describe spatial patterns of forest structure and species compositions over large scales in 1920s Finland, and to (2) analyze how these characteristics were influenced by human population and past land-uses.MethodsWe mapped ca. 3000 systematic sample plots measured in the first Finnish National Forest Inventory (1921-1924) and produced a series of maps of large-scale variation in forest characteristics in upland forests. We analyzed forest age and size structures, and species compositions relative to human population and land-use data.ResultsWe found strong geographical and regional gradients in forest age and size structures, and tree species composition. Depending on the variable, these characteristics were at the stand-level best explained by human population density, reflecting the long history of various forest uses. Tree species composition was clearly associated with site productivity, but also with the history of slash-and-burn agriculture and forest grazing.ConclusionsForest landscapes in the early twentieth century Finland exhibited a strong human fingerprint, visible as the abundance of young forests in populated areas, while in remote areas forest characteristics typical of natural forests prevailed. These gradients in human impact a century ago are still reflected as legacies in forest structure, a situation that needs consideration in management and restoration.

AB  - Genetic enhancement of tree species is integral to global forest management practices with mass propagation of enhanced plant material being used to reforest whole landscapes. It is unclear, however, how genetic enhancement of basic traits such as tree growth may influence the function of life supporting soil ecosystems. We studied the potential cascading effects of genetic increases in growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) on a range of soil chemical and biological properties. Because this species is a prime candidate for the genetic enhancement of boreal forest landscapes and it has been introduced around the world, its impacts on soil microbiomes are likely of importance both locally and globally. In a 40-year common garden, we assessed how genetic increases in growth generated through controlled crossing of high-quality "plus" trees from across the central boreal zone of Sweden influenced a range of soil properties beneath the canopies. Properties included pH, carbon, nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, respiration rate, and the composition of microbial communities assessed via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). We found that Norway spruce family significantly affected each of the seven chemical properties assessed, with differences of up to 140% among families, and that three of the seven were significantly correlated with mean family growth rate. We also found that fungal PLFAs varied significantly across Norway spruce families, but these differences were not strongly related to mean family growth rate. This study, representing just one cycle of selective breeding, suggests that genetic increases in tree growth rates may also be inadvertently altering soil communities and ecosystem services. Such alterations across forest landscapes may have unexpected implications for the function of forest ecosystems (i.e., nutrient cycling) as well as processes of global significance (i.e., carbon sequestration).

AB  - Woodpecker species as a group require several properties (dead wood, old deciduous and large trees) that are characteristic of natural forest, the presence of which are not compatible with intensive forest management. The occurrence of many woodpecker species may thus indicate a high degree naturalness of forests. Using woodpeckers as indicators requires that we understand how these species were distributed in naturally dynamic landscapes, as well as quantitative knowledge of their requirements. We review the basic biology of boreal/hemiboreal woodpeckers and compare the degree of specialization of the different woodpecker species with their population trends and with changes in habitat distribution in the boreal/hemiboreal landscape over the last century. The comparison shows that there is a close connection between the degree of specialization of woodpeckers, the changes in forests and recent population trends. Thus woodpecker species as a group are in conflict with intensive forest management. To keep viable populations of all woodpecker species in a landscape existing values must be preserved and natural features be built into future forests. Future research should include studies of distribution, abundance, habitat niche breadth and fitness of different woodpecker species in landscapes with different degrees of naturalness.

AB  - The importance of sustainability considerations in contaminated land management (CLM) is highlighted in policy frameworks all around the world. It means that while the reduction of risks to human health and the environment remains the main goal of CLM, a variety of other environmental factors as well as economic and social aspects have an increasing role in decision making. The success of finding the right balance between these considerations and incorporating them in the risk management approach defines the overall sustainability of the outcome. Although the concept and principles of sustainable CLM are already widely accepted, they have not been fully realized in national procedures. According to several studies this often results from the lack of explicit policy measures. A sound policy framework in conjunction with functional policy instruments is therefore a prerequisite for the attainment of sustainable practices. In Finland, the environmental administration along with other key stakeholder groups, including regional authorities, landowners, consultants, industries, research institutes and academia, has developed a national strategy and associated policy measures in order to promote sustainable CLM.

AB  - Epiphytic and epixylic lichens were surveyed on 15 1-ha plots in mature Picea abies-dominated boreal forests in southern Finland. The sample plots were classified into three groups according to the age of the dominant tree stand and recent signs of cutting: (1) early mature managed, 'EM' (95 - 109 yr), (2) late mature managed, 'LM' (126 - 145 yr) and (3) old-growth, 'OG' (129 - 198 yr). Two data sets on epiphytic and epixylic lichens were recorded from each plot: (1) species on basal trunks and branches of Picea abies and (2) species on all available woody substrates, including basal parts of all tree species, saplings, snags, logs and stumps.
   142 epiphytic and epixylic lichen species were found, of which 83 (58 %) occurred on P. abies. Mean total numbers of species per sample plot were 69 in EM, 78 in LM and 88 in OG plots, species number on P. abies were 47, 56, and 54 respectively. The LM plots had lower species numbers than OG plots, mainly due to the lack of old Populus tremula trees, but they had higher species number than the EM plots mainly due to the higher age of Picea abies. Differences in species composition, both within and between the three groups, were small. The results suggest that the epiphytic and epixylic lichen diversity in a managed stand can be increased by prolonging the rotation of the stand to > 120 yr and by increasing the diversity of habitats in the stand.

AB  - Lichens comprise a significant part of forest biota, but their diversity patterns are poorly known at medium spatial scales, which are most relevant for management planning. We carried out exhaustive lichen surveys in two 2-ha plots of old, weakly harvested herb-rich forests in Estonia; the field effort exceeded 500 hours for each plot. We recorded 222 species (194 lichens, 14 lichenicolous and 14 saprobic fungi traditionally treated by lichenologists), including 57 species of conservation concern. Those numbers form ca. one-third of forest species known in this fungal group in Estonia and were very similar in the two plots. Bacidia hemipolia f. Czarnota & Coppins, Lecanora farinaria Boner. Porina borreri (Trevis.) D.Hawksw. & P.James and Phaeocalicium tremulicola (Norrl. ex Nyl.) Tibell are reported as new to Estonia, and several other rare or little-known species were found. Many putative 'old-growth indicator species' formed local populations of substantial size. Using a fixed-effort approach (based on 4 survey hours per 2 ha) we demonstrate that the species richness in the studied stands exceeds that previously found in conventionally managed 2-ha stands and is not smaller than in old growth of similar site type. These results indicate that old selectively cut forests can provide valuable microhabitats and host rich lichen communities, and they represent a useful option for enhancing biodiversity in forest landscapes managed predominantly by even-aged systems.

AB  - In Lithuania as well as in whole European Union general politics of agriculture and forest sectors is concerned on ecological processes. The number of ecological practices in commercial management of agriculture and forest sectors is throughout increase. One of the most widely applied measures to protect seeds from the damage caused by fungi is spreading treaters. Alternative is to use high temperature. All live organisms are destroyed in a high temperature environment. It is very important to find optimal treatment time of high temperature so that pathogenic organisms would be destroyed but germination characteristics of the seeds would remain unaffected. Investigation performed on 2009-2010 in Forest's Seeds and Plantings Quality Department laboratory and Siauliai Forest Enterprise nursery. We investigated how a damp water steam effects germination of Norway Spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) seeds. In laboratory control sample was affected by fungicide MaximStar 025 FS (2g/kg) and it's germination was 90.5%. Thermally treated seeds germination varied between 95.9% and 82.35% depending on treatment time (1 s and 4 s respectively) in high temperature environment. Ground germination of chemicals treated seeds was about 44.9%, whereas germination of seeds treated by damp water steam varied between 61.1% and 78.6%.

AB  - The excessive simplification of forest structure associated with clear cutting can carry risks for biodiversity. Tree retention is an alternative practice that maintains greater structural diversity, but its effects on climate change impacts relative to conventional harvesting are largely unexplored. By integrating field measurements from 12 forest stands with modelling approaches, we investigated the post-harvest effects on radiative forcing of tree retention in a Swedish boreal pine forest. In the near-term, impacts from carbon fluxes and surface albedo were of the same order of magnitude but with opposite sign (warming for carbon and cooling for albedo), with a net warming effect. In the long-term, the net effect turns to cooling, as the forest becomes a strong carbon sink. Retention had a significant effect on climate in the near-term, where differences between the various retention levels are more evident. At increasing tree retention, warming impacts from carbon fluxes tend to decrease, but cooling contributions from surface albedo are less pronounced. Balancing these effects, we find a net climate warming that increases with tree retention.

AB  - Organic enrichment from fish farming may impact benthic species and habitats in adjacent areas. Norwegian salmon farming is continuously growing, but, due to area conflicts and severe sea-lice problems in the western areas, growth of the industry is focused in the northern areas. Knowledge is scarce on how an increase in fish farming will impact Arctic and subarctic species and habitats. One such species is the Iceland scallop Chlamys islandica, distributed from the Lofoten Islands in Nordland County to the Varangerfjord in Troms and Finnmark County. To study the impact of fine-particle fish faeces on feeding and reproductive ability in adult Iceland scallop, particles <41 mu m of finfish waste were added to the diet. Effects were tested via short-term (weeks) feeding studies using 2 diets, 100% cultured algal species and a 50% mix of algae and fish waste. In addition, a 100% fish waste diet was used to study longer-term effects on reproductive ability (months). Feeding (% particle clearance and feeding rate) on the microalgae diet tended to be higher than that on the diet containing fish waste, but the difference was significant only in 2 out of 4 cases. We did not find any effect of diets on reproductive ability (gonad development and fatty acid profiles) of scallops. Lack of knowledge on sufficient food levels for gonad maturation in this species may have affected the results. We suggest that future work includes the transplant of scallops from a reference site to fish production sites and that investigations begin immediately after spawning early in scallop gonad development.

AB  - Deadwood is an important component for conserving carbon stock and maintaining species diversity. Scarce information is, at present, available concerning the amount and composition of deadwood in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. In this study, 21 sites were chosen to characterize different forest types among representative managed and unmanaged stands in the Central Apennines (Molise, Italy). Data were collected to assess living tree and deadwood volumes, and the relative abundance of different deadwood components in decay classes. The information gathered was related to human-induced disturbances on a regional scale. There were substantial differences in the deadwood volumes between managed and unmanaged stands, although this was not the case in the living tree volumes. Deadwood volumes were larger in unmanaged than in managed stands. In particular, large amounts of deadwood were found in managed Mediterranean and Anatolian fir forests, probably due to minimal management practices. Dead downed trees were less represented in managed forests as they are normally removed to facilitate logging activities. Logs occurred more frequently in managed stands as logging residues left on site. Most deadwood material belonged to early decay classes. Proportionally larger amounts of deadwood ascribed to class 1 in managed stands correlated with recent cutting activities. The relatively large amounts of deadwood attributed in unmanaged stands to class 3 demonstrate its longer persistence in unmanaged forests. This study represents a first systematic analysis of deadwood occurrence in a typical Mediterranean forest area, and should be useful in defining important objectives for sustainable forest management.

AB  - This virtual issue comprises papers that address diversification for providing sustainable solutions at different scales from cropping and grassland to food systems. The authors investigated processes in case studies at the landscape scale where synergies and trade-offs between social and environmental objectives become the most tangible. Contributions from all continents highlighted regional specificities related to diversification and include research from natural and social sciences, with inter- and transdisciplinary approaches including synthesis of knowledge (reviews), empirical studies with experiments as well as assessments with interviews in case studies: Model-based design of crop diversification, the role of digitalization for achieving sustainability in the European context, ecological engineering for rice pest suppression in China, the role of cereal species mixtures in Ethiopian smallholder farmers, diversified planting in arid irrigation areas in northwestern China, integration of legumes in European and Canadian cropping systems, screening of native forage legumes for northern Swedish grassland systems, cropping system diversification of smallholder farmers in south-central Bangladesh, identification of how farmers imagine diversified landscapes in southern Idaho in the US, farm diversification affecting impacts from COVID-19 across Europe, the role of diversified farming in Mato Grosso Brazil, diversification and soil management measures in Germany, value chain formation for the scaling of crop diversification, and the design process with farmers and scientists for the transition toward legume-supported farming in Europe. A key finding from these examples is that agricultural intensification has led to the simplification of cropping systems and landscapes in terms of species diversity and ecosystem function. To instead move towards sustainable transformation, all system levels (i.e. from the plot, farm, landscape, governance and overall food systems) need to interact and reinforce each other for diversification to deliver the desired outcomes.

AB  - Fish, epibenthos and macroinfauna were collected in a Zostera marina bed and nearby unvegetated sediments in the estuary of the Damariscotta River, on the mid-coast of Maine. Samples of epibenthic fauna and fish were collected at low tides both during day and night, and samples of infauna;st low tides during the day. The mean density of Zostera shoots in the study area was 335 m(-2). Abundance and species number of fish were greater at night than during the day and greater in eelgrass beds (Z. marina) than in unvegetated habitats. Daytime fish collections were dominated by Atlantic silversides (Medinia medinia), while juvenile winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) dominated night collections. Also Zostera-associated epifaunal abundances and number of species were significantly higher at night than during the day. Mysis stenolepis, Idotea balthica and Littorina obtusata were dominant species in the epifauna samples. Of the total of 37 invertebrate species encountered, only five occurred both in the infaunal and epifaunal samples. Nineteen different taxa were collected from the benthic core samples. The most abundant invertebrate infaunal taxa were sipunculids, the polychaete Nereis virens, and oligochaetes. Infaunal invertebrate abundances and species diversity were significantly higher in eelgrass beds than in unvegetated sediments. The abundance and number of species of benthic invertebrates were also positively correlated to seagrass biomass. Community diversity values (H') were relatively low but fit well in the general pattern of decreasing diversity towards northern latitudes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Macrozoobenthos (mz) was studied in different littoral habitats in the regulated Lake Pyhajarvi in Central Finland. The mean water level fluctuation of the lake is 82 cm (HW-NW/year). The sandy bottoms in the regulated area freeze in winter, while the marshy and stony detritus bottoms remain unfrozen. The total mz biomass in the regulated area was permanently lower on the freezing bottoms than on the unfrozen bottoms, although summer recolonization of the freezing zone was very effective, especially in years with high floods. The decline in the biomass in the freezing zone was compensated for in the deeper, undisturbed zone, and thus mean total biomass in autumn in the whole littoral (0-3 m) was even greater in the areas with freezing bottoms (696 mg ODW m-2) than in those with unfrozen bottoms (433 mg ODW m-2). The biomass in the freezing zone decreased by 73 % during the winter, whereas that in the unfrozen zone was the same in autumn and spring.
   The winter samples suggest that freezing greatly reduced the number of taxa, while the bottom quality had a major effect on macrofaunal mortality which was 36 % during the winter on the bare sandy bottom but about 7-8 % on the freezing organic bottom and unfrozen marshy shore. The oligochaetes were the most important mz group in the sheltered sandy and detritus bottoms, while the isospod Asellus was dominant on the exposed stony and sandy bottoms, where the mean biomass (207 mg ODW m-2) was lower clue to the wave action.

AB  - Soil compaction is a common consequence of forestry traffic traversing unprotected, moist soils; it decreases porosity and affects hydraulic conductivity even in coarse-textured soils. The aim here was to study root-zone hydrology and vegetation in three microsites (in, between, and beside wheel tracks) 4 to 5 yr after forwarder traffic, on stony and sandy till soils in two clearcuts in northern Sweden. Measurements of soil volumetric water content (VWC), vegetation indicators and one-dimensional hydrological modeling (Hydrus-1D) of wheel tracks and undisturbed soil were conducted. Soil VWC was monitored hourly during 2017 and 2018 in three or four plots along a slope on each site. Soil VWC was also measured once with a portable sensor in 117 plots along two slopes at each site, where the vegetation was recorded and analyzed using Ellenberg indicator indexes. Soil VWC was highest in wheel tracks and lowest between tracks; this was corroborated by the species composition in the wheel tracks (Ellenberg indicator for soil moisture). Bare soil was more frequent in wheel tracks and between tracks than in undisturbed soil. The model simulations indicated that the changed soil hydraulic properties influenced the VWC results in the wheel tracks. However, the differences in average pressure heads in the root zone were small between the microsites and only apparent during dry periods. In the wheel tracks, air-filled porosity was <0.10 m(3) m(-3), indicating insufficient soil aeration during 82% (Site T) and 23% (Site R) of the 2017 growing season. Insufficient aeration could be one explanation for the presence of some still unvegetated areas.

AB  - A revised Swedish forest health assessment system is presented. The assessment system is composed of several interacting components which target information needs for strategic and operational decision making and accommodate a continuously expanding knowledge base. The main motivation for separating information for strategic and operational decision making is that major damage outbreaks are often scattered throughout the landscape. Generally, large-scale inventories (such as national forest inventories) cannot provide adequate information for mitigation measures. In addition to broad monitoring programs that provide time-series information on known damaging agents and their effects, there is also a need for local and regional inventories adapted to specific damage events. While information for decision making is the major focus of the health assessment system, the system also contributes to expanding the knowledge base of forest conditions. For example, the integrated monitoring programs provide a better understanding of ecological processes linked to forest health. The new health assessment system should be able to respond to the need for quick and reliable information and thus will be an important part of the future monitoring of Swedish forests.

AB  - The distribution and bed structure of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), and its importance for associated faunal communities in the coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea are poorly known. The spatial distribution of the fauna associated with Zostera was studied at five localities in SW Finland in 1993-94. Zostera was common on all localities, but the beds varied in terms of area (1-5 m diameter), density (50-500 shoots/m(2)) and blade length (20-110 cm). A total of about 40 species or taxa were recorded. The zoobenthic infauna showed significant spatial differences, and total abundance and species diversity were significantly higher in the Zostera beds than in adjacent bare sand. The total abundance in Zostera ranged from 25 000 to 50 000 ind/m(2) and in sand from 2500 to 15 000 ind/m(2). The mean number of species in Zostera ranged from 5.9 to 8.8 spp (H' = 1.76-2.54) and in sand from 2.2 to 5.5 spp (H' = 1.67-2.31). The epifauna in Zostera was numerically dominated by grazing gastropods (Hydrobiidae) and copepods. The epifauna is an important community component, which contributes to the total diversity of the Zostera assemblage. These systems are among the most species-rich components of the shallow soft-bottom ecosystems in the northern Baltic Sea. The mechanisms structuring both the Zostera and the ambient sand-bottom habitats are presented.

AB  - Climate change will alter forest ecosystems and their provisioning of services. Forests in the Carpathian Mountains store high amounts of carbon and provide livelihoods to local people; however, no study has yet assessed their future long-term dynamics under climate change. Therefore, we selected a representative area of 1340 km(2) to investigate the effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on (i) the spatial dynamics of the dominant tree species and forest types and (ii) the trajectories of the associated aboveground live carbon (ALC). We simulated 500 years of change under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, incorporating wind and bark beetle disturbances using the LANDIS-II forest change model. Our simulations revealed a lagged adaptation of the forest landscape to climate change. While Picea abies dominance declined in all scenarios, Carpinus betulus expanded at low elevations and Acer pseudoplatanus at mid-elevations. We also found a slow but continuous expansion of Quercus petraea and Q. robur at low elevations and of Fagus sylvatica at mid and high elevations. This change in species composition was accompanied by a significant reduction of ALC: on average over the simulation period, unmitigated climate change reduced ALC between - 2.1% (RCP2.6) and - 14.0% (RCP8.5), while disturbances caused an additional reduction of ALC between - 4.5% (RCP2.6) and - 6.6% (RCP8.5). Therefore, foresighted management strategies are needed to facilitate vegetation adaptation to climate change, with the goal of stabilizing carbon storage and maintaining economic value of future Carpathian forests.

AB  - Worldwide kelp forests have been the focus of several studies concerning ecosystem dysfunction in the past decades. Multifactorial kelp threats have been described and include deforestation due to human impact, cascading effects and climate change. Here, we compared community and trophic structure in two contrasting kelp forests off the coasts of Brittany. One has been harvested five years before sampling and shelters abundant omnivorous predators, almost absent from the other, which has been treated as preserved from kelp harvest. delta N-15 analyses conducted on the overall communities were linked to the tropho-functional structure of different strata featuring these forests (stipe and holdfast of canopy kelp and rock). Our results yielded site-to-site differences of community and tropho-functional structures across kelp strata, particularly contrasting in terms of biomass on the understorey. Similarly, isotope analyses inferred the top trophic position of Marthasterias glacialis and Echinus esculentus which may be considered as strong interactors in the sub-canopy. We interrogate these patterns and propose a series of probable and testable alternative hypotheses to explain them. For instance, we propose that differences of trophic structure and functioning result from confounded effects of contrasting wave dissipation depending on kelp size-density structure and community cascading involving these omnivorous predators. Given the species diversity and complexity of food web highlighted in these habitats, we call for further comprehensive research about the overall strata and tropho-functional groups for conservation management in kelp forests.

AB  - There is public concern that large-scale disturbances to forest cover caused by insects and storm winds in the Bohemian Forest could intensify high water flows and enhance the expected flooding risks predicted in current regional climate change scenarios. We analysed stream discharge in Upper Vydra and Gro beta e Ohe, neighbouring catchments in the Bohemian Forest, the largest contiguous forested area in Central Europe. Upper Vydra, in the Sumava National Park, and Gro beta e Ohe (including the Upper Gro beta e Ohe headwater catchment in the Bavarian Forest National Park) are similar in size, but differ in land use cover and the extent of disturbed Norway spruce stands. Publicly available runoff and meteorological data (1978-2011) were examined using non-parametric trend and breakpoint analysis. Together with mapped vegetation cover changes, the results were used to address the following questions: 1) are there significant changes in the hydrological cycle and, if so, do these changes relate to 2) the extent and expansion of disturbance in forests stands and/or 3) altered precipitation dynamics and thermal conditions?
   We found no marked overall change in annual runoff or in annual or seasonal precipitation, but a significant increase in high flows in March. This overall trend related to the marked warming in late winter and early spring (+similar to 4 K in April, p < 0.01), irrespective of altitude and slope position. It significantly shifted the end of the snow cover period by more than three weeks to the beginning/middle of April depending on altitude, and intensified snow melt.
   In the Upper Grosse Ohe catchment, a significant decrease in catchment balance, the difference between the long term precipitation and runoff (-72 mm, 11%) was found when the loss of tree cover reached 30% of catchment area. Diminished evapotranspiration losses from severely disturbed stands increased groundwater recharge during summer and caused a significant rise in low flows in autumn.
   However, observed increases in late winter high flows were due to warming only. They could be further intensified by the increasing winter precipitation predicted under present climate change scenarios, and would therefore increase the risk of flooding at lower elevations.

AB  - Past semi-natural grassland extent is thought to have a major influence on contemporary species richness in rural landscapes. The loss of grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.
   Past and present grassland distribution was a major factor in determining plant species patterns found in grasslands today. All landscapes had an average of 80% grassland 300 years ago. Since then grassland has declined by 90% across all landscapes. Proportion of clay soils influenced the timing of grassland decline, where grasslands in landscapes dominated by clay soils were conversed to crop-fields more than 100 years ago. Grasslands on coarser soils declined later, primarily to forest. Landscapes with more than 10% semi-natural grassland left today had 50% higher species richness in all grasslands, including both abandoned and new grassland. Time since major grassland decline also seems to have an effect on the landscapes' species richness. The results show that plant species patterns in grasslands at local scales are determined by broader landscape processes which may have occurred many centuries ago. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predator effects on herbivores are often referred to as examples of biotic interactions that weaken with latitude, but more studies are needed to test for the generality of this pattern. To further the understanding of large-scale geographical patterns in abundance and diversity of predatory arthropods, from 2008-2011 we explored spider communities in the canopies of primary forest trees of the boreal zone (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula pubescens and B. pendula) along five latitudinal gradients in northern Europe, from 59 to 70 degrees N and from 10 to 60 degrees E. The abundance of arboreal spiders in Norway and Finland was about a half of that in Russia, presumably due to more intensive forest management in Scandinavia. The abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity of arboreal spiders generally decreased with latitude; however, actual weather conditions during the study years had little effect on this pattern. Coniferous species supported higher abundance and diversity of arboreal spiders than birches, but the poleward decrease in either abundance or taxonomic diversity of arboreal spiders did not differ between coniferous and deciduous tree species. In contrast, functional diversity on birches decreased with latitude greater than on coniferous trees. Euryphagous spiders showed stronger decrease with latitude in terms of both abundance and taxonomic diversity than more specialized (steno- and oligophagous) spiders. We attribute the general decrease in density and diversity of spiders with latitude to an increased pressure from apex predators (birds) rather than to direct effects of climate or changes in prey abundance. The abundance of spiders declined with the latitude to the greater extent than the densities of their potential prey did, suggesting a decrease in the strength of predator-prey interactions towards the north.

AB  - Protected areas are a key component in biodiversity conservation strategies, but evaluations of how effective they are in capturing species diversity is lacking for many ecosystems. We compared different protection types (animal sanctuaries, nature reserves and unprotected areas) using data on species richness and occurrence of coastal breeding bird species in a large archipelago in the Baltic Sea. Data were from extensive inventories based on a grid with 1 x 1 km resolution covering 4646 km(2) on the East coast of Sweden. We focused on specialist species breeding exclusively in coastal habitats since these species are of specific conservation concern, but considered generalists, which also breeds in inland wetlands, as well. Animal sanctuaries had significantly higher species richness of specialist species than unprotected areas and nature reserves. Nature reserves had even lower richness of specialist species than unprotected areas. Further, a rarity-weighted diversity index showed that animal sanctuaries were better in capturing hotspots of bird diversity compared to nature reserves and unprotected areas. Hotspots, both protected and unprotected, were scattered throughout the entire archipelago. The rarity-weighted richness is therefore useful to identify gaps in the protected area network. Overall, we conclude that the establishment of animal sanctuaries has been a successful conservation measure for protecting specialist species in several aspects. Ongoing human exploitation of the Baltic archipelagos prompt further consideration of protecting still unprotected but species rich shorelines for the benefit of many coastal breeding birds.

AB  - Outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism represent an increasingly intensive form of land use that has considerable impacts on native ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to investigate how revegetation and management of ski runs influence soil nutrients, vegetation characteristics, and the possible invasion of nonnative plant species used in revegetation into native ecosystems. A soil and vegetation survey at ski runs and nearby forests, and a factorial experiment simulating ski run construction and management (factors: soil removal, fertilization, and seed sowing) were conducted at Ruka ski resort, in northern Finland, during 2003-2008. According to the survey, management practices had caused considerable changes in the vegetation structure and increased soil nutrient concentrations, pH, and conductivity on the ski runs relative to nearby forests. Seed mixture species sown during the revegetation of ski runs had not spread to adjacent forests. The experimental study showed that the germination of seed mixture species was favored by treatments simulating the management of ski runs, but none of them could eventually establish in the study forest. As nutrient leaching causes both environmental deterioration and changes in vegetation structure, it may eventually pose a greater environmental risk than the spread of seed mixture species alone. Machine grading and fertilization, which have the most drastic effects on soils and vegetation, should, therefore, be minimized when constructing and managing ski runs.

AB  - The establishment of bioenergy plantations on previously unforested land will generally involve carbon accumulation in aboveground biomass for some period before final use of the biomass for energy. The equilibrium level of aboveground carbon stock may be substantially larger than the level prior to the plantation establishment. Soil carbon may increase, decrease or remain approximately constant depending on plantation characteristics, climate, soil type and land use history. Thus, besides fossil fuel substitution, also changes in the carbon stock influence the climate change mitigation potential of bioenergy plantations. The Bonn agreement (COP6) opens up for the linking of biomass plantations with the crediting of plantation-induced carbon sinks. Our analysis of the case of Salix production in Sweden indicates that the revenues from such carbon credits could be substantial. Thus, the new opportunity for crediting of the carbon sink component of plantations can have implications for the economics of biomass energy. It will also favor longer rotation periods and some types of crops over others, with annually harvested crops such as energy grasses having less incentive than short rotation forests.

AB  - The anticipated increase in extreme disturbance events due to climate change is likely to expose Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated forests in northern Europe to new conditions. Empirical data on the resilience of such natural (unmanaged) forests to disturbance and the long-term patterns of regeneration in its aftermath are currently scarce. We performed a quantitative assessment of natural forest stands in north-western Latvia to identify and characterise the patterns of stand structure 44 years after a stand-replacing disturbance and investigated the effects of legacies on regeneration. The spatial distribution of tree species and their dimensions were assessed in 71 circular sample plots (500 m(2) each) in natural forest areas, where Norway spruce dominated prior to the windthrow and salvage logging was not carried out. Spatial indices (species mingling index, size differentiation index, and aggregation index) were used to characterise stand structure and diversity. The different initial states (age and coverage of surviving trees) of stands affected eventual tree species dominance, size differentiation, degree of mingling and aggregation. Our results demonstrate a close relationship between disturbance legacies and spatial indices. The pre-storm understory and canopy survivors decreased species mingling, whereas survivors increased size differentiation. The size differentiation increased also with a higher degree of species mingling. Leaving differential post-storm legacies untouched promotes a higher structural and species diversity and therefore supports the management approach of preserving canopy survivors.

AB  - The canopy-forming brown macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus radicans (Fucus) are the largest habitat-building species on rocky shores of the northern Baltic Sea. While their role on the diversity of invertebrate fauna is well documented, there is little information on their importance for the diversity of associated mac-roalgal species. We used comprehensive mapping data from the Finnish marine area (divided into four sea areas) to test the relationship between Fucus coverage and algal biodiversity (number of taxonomic units, Shannon-Wiener diversity index H ' and Pielou's evenness J'). To account for environmental variation, depth, wave exposure, Secchi depth and salinity were included as covariates. Examination of the algal communities high-lighted a similar pool of taxonomic units across sea areas in shallow (0-4 m) rocky shores, with the two fila-mentous algal species Pylaiella littoralis and Ectocarpus siliculosus combined as one unit being the most common taxon. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was highest in sites with Fucus coverage between 25% and 75%, while evenness increased with Fucus coverage. We did not detect any effects of Fucus coverage on the number of taxonomic units, which was rather affected by environmental parameters (depth, Secchi depth and salinity). The results show that Fucus, depending on its coverage, both competes with and facilitates the macroalgal commu-nity. Based on extensive data, we show how Fucus coverage relates to the diversity of the surrounding algal communities, further improving our understanding of factors that control biodiversity on shallow rocky shores in the northern Baltic Sea.

AB  - Rotational perennial grass/clover has multiple effects in cropping systems dominated by cereals. This study evaluated the environmental impact of rotational grass/clover ley for anaerobic digestion in a cereal-dominated grain production system in Sweden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare two scenarios: (i) a cropping system including only spring barley and winter wheat; and (ii) a cropping system including 2-year grass/clover ley in combination with spring barley and winter wheat. The functional unit was one tonne of grain. The two main functions of the grass/clover crop were to provide feedstock for biogas production and to act as an organic fertiliser for allocation among the cereal crops in the rotation. Special consideration was given to nitrogen (N) management and the rotational effects of the grass/clover ley. In total, 73% of the N requirement of cereals in the ley scenario was met through symbiotic N fixation. Replacing diesel with biogas and mineral fertiliser with digested grass/clover biomass (digestate) reduced the use of fossil fuels substantially, from 1480 MJ per tonne in the reference scenario to -2900 MJ per tonne in the ley scenario. Potential eutrophication per tonne grain increased in the ley scenario, mainly owing to significantly higher ammonia emissions from spreading digestate and the larger area required for producing the same amount of grain. Potential acidification also increased when N mineral fertiliser was replaced by digestate. Crops relying on symbiotic N fixation are a promising feedstock for reducing the use of non-renewable energy in the production chain of farm-based bioenergy, but careful handling of the N-rich digestate is required. Replacing cereals intended for feed or food with bioenergy crops leads to indirect land use changes (iLUC) when the displaced crops must be produced elsewhere and the benefits obtained when biofuels replace fossil fuels may thereby be outweighed. In this study, the iLUC factor assumed had a critical effect on global warming potential in the ley scenario. However, carbon sequestration and the higher yield potential of subsequent cereal crops can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from iLUC to a varying extent. We recommend that crop sequences rather than single crops be considered when evaluating the environmental impact of production systems that include perennial legumes for food, feed and bioenergy.

AB  - In 2010, Norway introduced local management of national parks and other large protected areas. Boards comprised of local politicians are delegated extended powers in the management of the protected areas. This paper examines how this system of local management deals with the conflicting dimensions of local interests versus national obligations, and conservation versus use. The study is based on data from surveys to protected area board members and other actors involved, and on case studies in two protected areas. The main finding is that the boards, accountable to central government but comprised of politicians accountable to the local voters, aim to balance local interests and national obligations, and conservation and use. Popular involvement and anchorage is, however, weak due to lack of mobilization and transparency. Furthermore, formal restrictions hindering the boards from dealing with local economic development could make the boards less attractive for the local political leadership.

AB  - Forest floor is considered a major feature distinguishing forest from agricultural soils. Forest floor develops as forest stands grow and is composed of more or less altered plant-tissue biomass accumulated on the soil surface. Our study's aim was to find whether properties of both the organic layers and mineral soil differ according to the land-use history of the sites compared. Each site included an afforested area of immature 50-year-old spruce forest (AFF) on formerly agricultural land plus an adjacent area of old-growth 100-year-old spruce stand (FOR). The localities are situated at altitudes ranging between 600 and 850 metres above sea level. From the results of our study it can be concluded that both forest floor and mineral soil had higher pH and Ca concentration at formerly agricultural sites. C/N ratio is significantly lower in afforested soil. First-generation humus was significantly higher in phosphorus.

AB  - Decision making in managing biological diversity is critically dependent on adequate information concerning species-richness patterns and a rigorous understanding of species habitat relationships. Measures of primary productivity derived from satellite images may provide useful cost-effective estimates of species richness and distribution patterns over wide areas. We constructed Generalized Additive models (GAM) to investigate the potential of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to explain the species richness in 28 separate vascular plant families in boreal forest landscapes, northern Finland. The productivity models explained on average more of the species richness than the heterogeneity models. However, models that performed best were produced by combining productivity and heterogeneity variables into the same models. Species richness responded mainly unimodally or positively to productivity and its heterogeneity. We conclude that measures of productivity and heterogeneity based on remote sensing can provide useful 'first filters' of locations of high diversity in plant families in boreal landscapes.

AB  - The Svea coal mines in Svalbard have been closed, and the area is under restoration. The goal of the landscape restoration was to enable dynamic ecological and geomorphological processes by removing roads, housing, industrial facilities, airports, landfills, and quarries that once dominated the area. Cultural heritage features, such as pre-1946 buildings, structures, and mining traces, have been preserved, while the rest of the landscape has been restored to a near-natural state. The focus has been restoring geodiversity in this arctic environment, where biotic processes are slow. Geomorphological processes such as glacial, slope, fluvial, coastal, and permafrost processes dominate and give the landscape its geological character. The objective of the restoration is not merely to re-create the landscape's previous appearance but rather to ensure that natural processes can function as they did in the past, contributing to the ongoing development and evolution of all restored land surfaces. As of 2023, most of the area has already been restored. In areas with rapid geomorphological processes, the land will soon be dominated by these processes. Revegetation is one of the major ecological processes the restoration seeks to facilitate. Revegetation is a slow process in arctic environments, and it will take many decades before vegetation covers restored bare surfaces. The project forms a valuable baseline for studying and discussing geomorphology, landscape dynamics, geodiversity, biodiversity, and ecology for nature management and landscape restoration.

AB  - Populations of Plebejus argus were sampled in southwest Finland, both on the mainland and on islands, and in and around the Donana National Park in southwest Spain. A total of 453 individuals coming from 14 locations were investigated using allozyme electrophoresis on a total of 10 polymorphic allozyme loci. Contrary to earlier studies, all conducted in Britain, our samples showed little differentiation between sampled locations. In Spain, the populations of the Donana area showed no differentiation despite being up to 36 km apart; only the population to the south of the Guadalquivir river showed a significant difference to the others. In Finland the population on one island showed marked genetic differentiation from all the others, which showed little or no difference from each other. No isolation-by-distance effect could be detected in either system. We hypothesise that emigration-immigration events are more frequent in the Spanish and Finnish populations than in the British ones. We did, however, find two isolated populations, one in Spain and one in Finland; both were small and geographically isolated and shared evident drift.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the primary environmental causes of biodiversity decline across scales; locally to globally. Ecological restoration is acknowledged as an important tool to counteract this negative trend. The semi-natural calcareous sand dune meadows in south-western Norway are known for their high species diversity, much like similar habitats of high conservation value across Europe today. The recent cessation of grazing has caused a decline in several endangered species associated with these habitats due to the advancement of secondary succession. We conducted a long-term restoration experiment in semi-natural dune meadows over 16 years to examine if current trends in biodiversity loss could be reversed and at what time-scale restoration measures take effect. Three treatments were applied; mowing annually, mowing bi-annually, and a control (no mowing). In fields mown annually species richness increased significantly over time. However, the response was slow and significant effects were first seen after year 10. Fields mown bi-annually also showed a similar trend but the response was more variable. Several characteristic meadow species were favoured by annual mowing while they declined in the control fields. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a compositional shift, indicating the re-arrangement/-establishment of typical meadow vegetation in the mown sites, contrasting the further successional development in the control. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term data in supporting good evidence-based management. Annual mowing is effectively restoring this unique habitat, but restoration efforts need to be sustained over many years to show positive effects.

AB  - Slow-moving arctic soils commonly organize into striking largescale spatial patterns called solifluction terraces and lobes. Although these features impact hillslope stability, carbon storage and release, and landscape response to climate change, no mechanistic explanation exists for their formation. Everyday fluids-such as paint dripping down walls-produce markedly similar fingering patterns resulting from competition between viscous and cohesive forces. Here we use a scaling analysis to show that soil cohesion and hydrostatic effects can lead to similar largescale patterns in arctic soils. A large dataset of high-resolution solifluction lobe spacing and morphology across Norway supports theoretical predictions and indicates a newly observed climatic control on solifluction dynamics and patterns. Our findings provide a quantitative explanation of a common pattern on Earth and other planets, illuminating the importance of cohesive forces in landscape dynamics. These patterns operate at length and time scales previously unrecognized, with implications toward understanding fluid-solid dynamics in particulate systems with complex rheology.

AB  - Zoonoses are major contributors to emerging infectious diseases globally. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis caused by rodent-borne hantaviruses. In Europe, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) carried and shed by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), is the most common cause of HFRS. We explore the relationship of PUUV infection in bank voles, as measured by PUUV antibody detection, with habitat and landscape scale properties during two successive vole cycles in boreal Sweden. Our analysis revealed that PUUV infection in the population was not uniform between cycles and across different landscapes. The mean density index of PUUV antibody positive and negative bank voles were highest in old forest, second highest in cut-over forest (approx. 0-30 years old) and lowest on mires. Most importantly, old forest was the core habitat, where PUUV antibody positive bank voles were found through the low density phase and the transition between successive vole cycles. In spring, occurrence of antibody positive voles was negatively related to the proportion of cut-over forest in the surrounding landscape, suggesting that large scale human induced land-use change altered the occurrence of PUUV infection in voles which has not been shown before. Dependence of PUUV infection on habitat and landscape structure, and the variation in infection load within and between cycles are of importance for human risk assessment.

AB  - The challenges posed by climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply interconnected. Successful co-managing of these tangled drivers requires innovative methods that can prioritize and target management actions against multiple criteria, while also enabling cost-effective land use planning and impact scenario assessment. This paper synthesises the development and application of an integratedmultidisciplinary modelling and evaluation framework for carbon and biodiversity in forest systems. By analysing and spatio-temporally modelling carbon processes and biodiversity elements, we determine an optimal solution for their co-management in the study landscape. We also describe how advanced Earth Observation measurements can be used to enhance mapping and monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The scenarios used for the dynamic models were based on official Finnish policy goals for forest management and climate change mitigation. The development and testing of the system were executed in a large region in southern Finland (Kokemaenjoki basin, 27,024 km(2)) containing highly instrumented LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) stations; these LTER data sources were complemented by fieldwork, remote sensing and national data bases. In the study area, estimated total net emissionswere currently 4.2 TgCO(2)eq a(-1), but modelling of forestrymeasures and anthropogenic emission reductions demonstrated that it would be possible to achieve the stated policy goal of carbon neutrality by low forest harvest intensity. We show how this policy-relevant information can be further utilized for optimal allocation of set-aside forest areas for nature conservation, which would significantly contribute to preserving both biodiversity and carbon values in the region. Biodiversity gain in the area could be increased without a loss of carbon-related benefits. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats are considered as major threats to plant species richness. Recently several studies have pinpointed the need to analyse past landscape patterns to understand effects of fragmentation, as the response to landscape change may be slow in many organisms, plants in particular. We compared species richness in continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in different commonplace rural landscapes in Sweden, and analysed effects of isolation and area in three time-steps (100 and 50 years ago and today). Old cadastral maps and aerial photographs were used to analyse past and present landscape patterns in 25 sites. Two plant diversity measures were investigated; total species richness and species density. During the last 100 years grassland area and connectivity have been reduced by about 90%. Present-day habitat area was positively related to total species richness in both habitats. There was also a relationship to habitat area 50 years ago for continuously grazed grasslands. Only present management was related to species density: continuously grazed grasslands had the highest species density. There were no relationships between grassland connectivity, present or past, and any diversity measure. We conclude that landscape history is not directly important for present-day plant diversity patterns in ordinary landscapes, although past grassland management is a prerequisite for the grassland habitats that can be found there today. It is important that studies are conducted, not only in very diverse landscapes, but also in managed landscapes in order to assess the effects of fragmentation on species.

AB  - Genetic resources of forest trees are considered as a key factor for the persistence of forest ecosystems because the ability of tree species to survive under changing climate depends strongly on their intraspecific variation in climate response. Therefore, utilizing available genetic variation in climate response and planting alternative provenances suitable for future climatic conditions is considered as an important adaptation measure for forestry. On the other hand, the distribution of adaptive genetic diversity of many tree species is still unknown and the predicted shift of ecological zones and species' distribution may threaten forest genetic resources that are important for adaptation. Here, we use Norway spruce in Austria as a case study to demonstrate the genetic variation in climate response and to analyse the existing network of genetic conservation units for its effectiveness to safeguard the hotspots of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity of this species. An analysis of the climate response of 480 provenances, clustered into 9 groups of climatically similar provenances, revealed high variation among provenance groups. The most productive and promising provenance clusters for future climates originate from three regions that today depict the warmest and driest areas of the natural spruce distribution in Austria. Gap analysis of the Austrian genetic conservation units in the EUFGIS Portal suggests adequate coverage of the genetic hotspots in southern parts of Austria, but not in eastern and northern Austria. Therefore conservation measures and sustainable utilization of the valuable genetic resources in these regions need to be expanded to cover their high adaptive genetic variation and local adaptation to a warmer climate. The study shows that current conservation efforts need to be evaluated for their effectiveness to protect genetic resources that are important for the survival of trees in a future climate.

AB  - A vast majority of European farmers are dependent on EU subsidies, which makes subsidy regulations through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) powerful tools in shaping agricultural landscapes. Unfortunately, steering recommendations are sometimes arbitrary, like in the case of pasture management, where 50 trees per hectare constitute an upper limit to qualify for subsidies. Although pasture biodiversity is well studied and the core of many CAP conservation programmes, it is seldom studied as direct effects of subsidy systems. In this paper, we examine plant diversity in relation to the impact of subsidy systems in Swedish woody pastures along a gradient from 3 to 214 trees per hectare. We selected 64 sites where we recorded vascular plants, soil properties and canopy cover. We found a general increase in gamma- and beta-diversity along the gradient, whereas alpha-diversity and the number of grassland specialists remained indifferent along the gradient. Additionally, tree density, organic content and CN-ratio were the strongest predictors of species composition. Hence, when CAP regulations encourage tree cutting for pastures to qualify for subsidies there is risk of homogenisation of EU grasslands, leading to decreased and gamma- and beta-diversity. If a general target for the subsidies is to increase biodiversity, there is need to scrutinise these regulation details to preserve the high values of woody pastures. We argue that habitat variation, species diversity and low intensity management, rather than a specific number of trees, should be the main incentives for financial support to preserve biodiversity.

AB  - Historically, semi-natural pastures were important for Sweden's food supply but this importance, and the area grazed, decreased strongly during the 20th century. Remaining areas are of major importance for nature conservancy today on account of their high biodiversity and cultural values. Consequently, a national goal is to ensure that those areas still grazed are also grazed in the future and that grazing is expanded to include particularly important seminatural pastures where grazing has ceased. The aim of this paper is to consider scenarios under which economically sustainable grazing of species-rich semi-natural pastures can be achieved. These scenarios are informed both by agricultural statistics describing trends in livestock availability in Sweden and by interviews with a sample of farmers who manage valuable pastures. The statistics show a rapid decrease in number of herds and a slightly reduced number of grazing animals. Three scenarios are considered: 1, continued grazing on existing farms with the farmer's own animals; 2, nature conservancy entrepreneurs who move grazing animals around on otherwise ungrazed pastures, and 3, creating large areas of pasture-forest mosaics from existing and previously abandoned pastures and marginal arable land, thereby enabling a combination of nature conservancy and cost-efficient meat production. The interviews reveal that it would be unrealistic to expect scenario 1 alone to fulfil the conservation goal, especially in forest-dominated regions characterised by a high proportion of elderly farmers with small herds. Development of new enterprises, according to scenarios 2 and 3, is therefore an essential complement to the present EU environmental allowances if the cost of preserving grazing-dependent biodiversity is not to increase massively in the future.

AB  - The assessment of a forest resource in national inventories provides a firm basis for the calculation of biomass and carbon (C) stocks of forests. Biomass expansion factors (BEFs) and conversion factors provide a robust and simple method of converting from forest tree stem volume to total forest biomass. These factors should be constructed on the basis of nationally specific data in order to take account of regional differences in growth rates, management practices, etc. The objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of biomass estimation by calculating a range of age-dependant BEFs from representative data that more accurately describe the allometry of present forests. The results from this study show that the allocation of biomass to compartments in forest stands and throughout a rotation varies considerably, and that the use of BEFs for the calculation of C stocks in forests of sub-timber dimensions is highly impractical.

AB  - In this study we evaluate the profitability of nutrient abatement measures in eutrophied coastal areas exposed to a risk of frequent oil spills. The case studied is the Gulf of Finland, which forms part of the Baltic Sea. We present a dynamic model that integrates land loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, cost of nutrient abatement measures in agriculture, nutrient dynamics in the sea basins adjoining the Finnish coast, exogenous risk of oil spills, and recreational value of the sea, which faces environmental damage of uncertain magnitude and duration. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the profitability of nutrient abatement measures carried out unilaterally by Finland or as a joint effort by Estonia, Finland and Russia. We demonstrate that a high exogenous risk of oil damage may render investments in nutrient abatement economically infeasible. On the other hand, several components of the model entail uncertainties owing to the scarcity of data and our limited understanding of the relationship between the ecological processes involved and the values people place on natural resources. For example, the uncertainties related to the curvature of the value function outweigh the uncertainties connected with the oil spills and their potential consequences.

AB  - The sample plot data of National Forest Inventories (NFI) are widely used in the analysis of forest production and utilization possibilities to support national and regional forest policy. However, there is an increasing interest for similar impact and scenario analyses for strategic planning at the local level. As the fairly sparse network of field plots only provides calculations for large areas, satellite image data have been applied to produce forest information for smaller areas. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of generating forest data for a Finnish forest analysis tool, the MELA system, by means of the Landsat satellite imagery and the NFI sample plot data. The study was part of the preparation of a local forestry programme, where a strategic scenario analysis for the forest area of two villages (ca 8000 ha) was carried out. Management units that approximate forest stands were delineated by image segmentation. Stand volume and other parameters for each forest segment were estimated from weighted means of the NFI sample plots, where the individual sample plot weights were estimated by the k nearest neighbour (kNN) method. Two different spectral features were tested: single pixel values and average pixel values within a segment. The estimated forest data were compared with the forest data based on independent stand-level field assessments in two subareas, a national park and an area of forest managed for timber production.
   In the national park, the estimated mean volume of the growing stock from both spectral feature sets (about 160 m(3) ha(-1)) was clearly lower than that obtained from stand-level field assessment (186 m(3) ha(-1)). Using average pixel values within a segment resulted in a higher proportion of pine and a lower proportion of spruce volume than using single pixel values. It also resulted in an estimated felling potential nearly 10% higher over the first 10-year period in the scenario analysis of the area dedicated to timber production. However, the maximum long-term sustainable removal was at the same level (about 30,000 m(3) year(-1)) for both feature sets over the simulated 30-year period. The resulting annual felling area in the first 10-year period was 12% lower when the segment averages were applied, but the difference subsequently levelled off. The kNN approach in estimating initial forest data for scenario analyses at the local level was found promising. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest liming is often used as a mitigation tool to counteract soil acidification that is caused by atmospheric deposition. However, our understanding of the long-term effects of liming on forest communities is still incomplete. We examine the effects of repeated liming on the herb layer of spruce stands in the Ore Mountains in East Germany. The area is characterised by acidic bedrock and profound soil acidification caused by high levels of anthropogenic sulphur deposition in the late twentieth century. Lime has been applied as part of forest management since 1988. We created a stratified sample in which we recorded vegetation releves covering spruce stands without liming (L0) and with one to five lime applications (L1-L5). We found a positive correlation between liming intensity and alpha diversity. Most of the indicator species were identified for spruce stands with high liming intensity (L2-L5), but no indicators were found for unlimed stands. From the third liming, the impact of lime application on species diversity and composition saturated. Several of the species promoted by liming are typical for mature stands of the natural vegetation but had declined in the twentieth century. Thus, a slight trend towards the restoration of the natural vegetation can be seen after liming. However, this is contrasted with a strong increase in species that are disturbance indicators (i.e. species of nitrogen-rich soils and open habitats). Continuation of liming as part of regular forestry management will cause these effects to establish permanently over large areas. Based on these findings, we make suggestions to adapt forest management strategies.

AB  - Temperate forest soils of central Europe are regarded as important pools for soil organic carbon (SOC) and thought to have a high potential for carbon (C) sequestration. However, comprehensive data on total SOC storage, particularly under different forest types, and its drivers is limited. In this study, we analyzed a forest data set of 596 completely sampled soil profiles down to the parent material or to a depth of 1 m within Bavaria in southeast Germany in order to determine representative SOC stocks under different forest types in central Europe and the impact of different environmental parameters. We calculated a total median SOC stock of 9.8 kg m(-2) which is considerably lower compared with many other inventories within central Europe that used modelled instead of measured soil properties. Statistical analyses revealed climate as controlling parameter for the storage of SOC with increasing stocks in cool, humid mountainous regions and a strong decrease in areas with higher temperatures. No significant differences of total SOC storage were found between broadleaf, coniferous and mixed forests. However, coniferous forests stored around 35% of total SOC in the labile organic layer that is prone to human disturbance, forest fires and rising temperatures. In contrast, mixed and broadleaf forests stored the major part of SOC in the mineral soil. Moreover, these two forest types showed unchanged or even slightly increased mineral SOC stocks with higher temperatures, whereas SOC stocks in mineral soils under coniferous forest were distinctly lower. We conclude that mixed and broadleaf forests are more advantageous for C sequestration than coniferous forests. An intensified incorporation of broadleaf species in extent coniferous forests of Bavaria would prevent substantial SOC losses as a result of rising temperatures in the course of climate change.

AB  - The paper deals with the effect of environmental factors and management on various mixed lowland forests in the Mednik National Natural Monument, Czech Republic, over a 20-year period. The objectives were to evaluate the structure, production, dynamics and radial growth in relation to climatic conditions in the mixed hornbeam-oak, herb-rich beech and spruce forest stands. The tree density decreased by 8.5% (to 120-1,364 trees.ha(-1)), while stand volume increased by 28.0% (to 244-767 m(3).ha(-1)) from 1998 to 2018. Large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies /L./ Karst.) showed high variability and sensitivity to climatic factors in radial growth compared to stability and resistance in sessile oak (Quercus petraea /Matt./ Liebl.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). April, June and July were determined as the most significant months in relation to diameter increment. The synergism of precipitation deficit and high air temperature was a limiting factor of growth in the studied lowland area. 'Ihe frequency of negative pointer years with extremely low radial growth has been increasing recently. Generally, hornbeam-oak stands are characterized by rich structure, high density and lower productivity, herb-rich beech stands represent rich structured productive forests and spruce forests are very productive stands but with low ecological stability.

AB  - The Koster Trench is the deepest part of the Kosterfjord located in the Skagerrak at the north-west coast of Sweden. In 2009 the Kosterfjord was included into the Marine Protected area Kosterhavet National Park char-acterized by high biodiversity and a presence of cold-water coral reefs dominated by Lophelia pertusa. The cold-water coral reefs show signs of deterioration and are known to have a much wider distribution during the past. In this study we investigate the temporal variability of the Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) using benthic fora-minifera and sediment geochemistry from a sediment core collected in the Koster Trench together with available hydrographic timeseries and meteorological data. We found that the EcoQS for TOC, metals, and foraminiferal indices suggest high to good ecological status close to natural background levels (reference conditions). How-ever, arsenic (As) content in the sediment has been rising steadily over the period -1880-2009. Given this pollutant will continue to rise further, it may pass a threshold after which it becomes toxic to the benthic or-ganisms, reaching intermediate EcoQS as it was shown by previous studies. Multivariate statistics performed on foraminiferal data identified three assemblages characterising the record: 1) Stainforthia fusiformis group at -1880-1940; 2) Bulimina marginata, Cassidulina laevigata and Hyalinea baltica group between -1940-1985, and, finally, 3) Stainforthia fusiformis and Textularia earlandi group at -1985-2009. The benthic foraminifera and sediment geochemistry suggests that a decrease in coastal upwelling due to positive NAO together with an in -crease in freshwater inflow from 1979/1980s; changes in phytoplankton community composition in late 2000s, and trawling activity shifted to the deepest fjord basin from 2009, all together likely have caused a shift towards more opportunistic foraminiferal species with an omnivorous feeding strategies and tolerance of physical disturbance.

AB  - Intensive forestry has led to landscape level deficits of important substrates such as deadwood and its associated biodiversity. Several taxa face extinction debts due to continuous declines and lack of regeneration of important habitats. Deadwood-dependent lichens are of great conservation concern due to a general lack of deadwood and due to their slow establishment, especially of rare species. In a field restoration experiment in central Sweden, we studied deadwood-dependent lichens for eight years, their association to different types of deadwood and their response to environmental change caused by variable retention forestry, deadwood enrichment and prescribed burning. Prescribed burning and site preparation caused depauperate lichen species assemblages throughout the study period but retention felling did not majorly affect lichen species assemblages. We found that lichen species were nested along deadwood qualities and deadwood created in the experiment only hosted a subset of lichen species found on kelo wood. Despite large reductions of kelo wood with lichen occurrences over the study period, overall species richness did not decrease. The fact that a large part of the lichen community occur only on kelo wood and that kelo wood is not regenerated implies that lichens associated with kelo wood face an extinction debt. In order to avoid local extinctions of deadwood-dependent lichens, site preparation and prescribed burning should be avoided in areas rich in high quality deadwood. There is urgent need to start creating new kelo wood through reoccurring fires in order to halt the impending extinction debt.

AB  - Grass-based biomass from grasslands can be used as feedstock in green biorefineries (GBs) that produce a range of biobased products. In addition, adjustments made as part of crop rotation to increase areas under temporary grasslands can yield benefits such as carbon sequestration, increased soil productivity, reduced eutrophication and reduced need for pesticides. In this paper, a flexible modeling framework is developed to analyze the deployment options for GBs that use grass-clover to produce protein feed and feedstock for bioenergy. The focus is placed on optimal deployment, considering system configuration and operation, as well as land use changes designed to increase grass-clover cultivation on cropland. A case study involving 17 counties in Sweden showed that the deployment of GB systems could support biomethane and protein feed production corresponding to 5-60 and 13-154%, respectively, of biomethane and soybean feed imports to Sweden in 2020.

AB  - Five circular forest fragments of increasing size (1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 112 and 1 ha) were isolated in early 1986 on a 41-ha clearcut in north-western Sweden. I compared changes in the forest structure of these fragments with those of three control plots in adjacent unfragmented forest, during a five-year period. The site was a high-altitude, old-growth Picea abies forest.
   In the first autumn after isolation a period with high winds caused severe blowdown and other forest damage in all five fragments. Total tree mortality after 67 months showed a steep increase with decreasing area, from 30% in the 1-ha fragment to 98% in the 1/16-ha fragment. Uprooting was the most common type of mortality (67%) followed by stem-breakage (24%). The marked increase in wind-induced tree deaths shifted the mortality pattern, from being independent of tree size in controls to showing a strong positive relationship with diameter infragments.
   The study shows that completely isolated forest fragments up to at least 1 ha in size became entirely edge habitat shortly after logging. Edge-related changes in forest structure, deposition of woody debris and soil disturbance, triggered by altered climate, are key factors for understanding ecological processes operating in forest fragments. This supports the view that changes in small fragments are mainly driven by external factors.

AB  - This paper compares the characteristics and properties of wood from trees grown on forest land with trees grown on former farmland. The first generation of the tree stand, which was artificially introduced on lands previously used for farming, was accepted as an ecosystem on the former farmland. A total of 36 trees from 12 areas were chosen for the comparisons, where six areas contained former farmland and six contained forest land. The compared tree stands differed from each other only in terms of the growth conditions, i.e., forest and former farmland soils. Selected properties and characteristics of the tree tissue, including density, bending strength, wood static compression, thickness of the cell wall, and lignin content in the dry mass, were subject to analysis. The conducted research found significant differences in the analyzed variables between the compared tree groups. The pines grown on former farmland soil were characterized by a generally poor technical wood quality, thinner tracheid walls, and lower lignin content.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) availability plays multiple roles in the boreal landscape, as a limiting nutrient to forest growth, determinant of terrestrial biodiversity, and agent of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. We review existing research on forest N dynamics in northern landscapes and address the effects of management and environmental change on internal cycling and export. Current research foci include resolving the nutritional importance of different N forms to trees and establishing how tree-mycorrhizal relationships influence N limitation. In addition, understanding how forest responses to external N inputs are mediated by above-and belowground ecosystem compartments remains an important challenge. Finally, forestry generates a mosaic of successional patches in managed forest landscapes, with differing levels of N input, biological demand, and hydrological loss. The balance among these processes influences the temporal patterns of stream water chemistry and the long-term viability of forest growth. Ultimately, managing forests to keep pace with increasing demands for biomass production, while minimizing environmental degradation, will require multi-scale and interdisciplinary perspectives on landscape N dynamics.

AB  - We examined how population structure affects seed set and recruitment in the dioecious plant Antennaria dioica, which is a declining species inhabiting semi-natural grasslands in Sweden. Flowering and sex ratio in A. dioica were studied over 4 y at a local (1.2 km(2)) scale and over I y at a regional (742 km(2)) scale in southern Sweden. Antennaria dioica was also hand-pollinated during 2 y to examine whether sex ratios, male abundance, and distance to nearest male influence the degree of pollen limitation. Seed-sowing experiments were conducted to assess whether recruitment is limited by seed or microsite availability. There was a considerable spatio-temporal variation in both flowering and sex ratios. The regional scale survey showed that patch size and number of patches per site were positively correlated, and small patches of A. dioica tended to have biased sex ratios. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that the degree of pollen limitation increased with increasingly female-biased sex ratios in the closest vicinity of the experimental plants. Thus, even though A. dioica is pollinated by many different insects, a fragmented population structure has a large influence on reproductive performance of A. dioica. The seed-sowing experiments showed that recruitment is limited by a combination of seed and microsite availability. It is therefore plausible that reduced seed production due to pollen limitation translates into reduced recruitment. The results from the local and the regional scale indicate that a large fraction of local patches and populations of A. dioica have decreased sexual reproduction. The conclusion is that A. dioica is likely to be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Vegetation holds the key to many properties that make natural mires unique, such as surface microtopography, high biodiversity values, effective carbon sequestration and regulation of water and nutrient fluxes across the landscape. Despite this, landscape controls behind mire vegetation patterns have previously been poorly described at large spatial scales, which limits the understanding of basic drivers underpinning mire ecosystem services. We studied catchment controls on mire nutrient regimes and vegetation patterns using a geographically constrained natural mire chronosequence along the isostatically rising coastline in Northern Sweden. By comparing mires of different ages, we can partition vegetation patterns caused by long-term mire succession (<5000 years) and present-day vegetation responses to catchment eco-hydrological settings. We used the remote sensing based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to describe mire vegetation and combined peat physicochemical measures with catchment properties to identify the most important factors that determine mire NDVI. We found strong evidence that mire NDVI depends on nutrient inputs from the catchment area or underlying mineral soil, especially concerning phosphorus and potassium concentrations. Steep mire and catchment slopes, dry conditions and large catchment areas relative to mire areas were associated with higher NDVI. We also found long-term successional patterns, with lower NDVI in older mires. Importantly, the NDVI should be used to describe mire vegetation patterns in open mires if the focus is on surface vegetation, since the canopy cover in tree-covered mires completely dominated the NDVI signal. With our study approach, we can quantitatively describe the connection between landscape properties and mire nutrient regime. Our results confirm that mire vegetation responds to the upslope catchment area, but importantly, also suggest that mire and catchment aging can override the role of catchment influence. This effect was clear across mires of all ages, but was strongest in younger mires.

AB  - The increased utilization of non-native tree species in monocultures or tree mixtures has repeatedly been shown to have negative consequences for the abundance and biomass of natural enemies. However, it is often unknown whether these effects translate into lower top-down control, and if so, whether these effects are driven by tree diversity and identity or by factors not strictly attributed to tree identity (e.g. light conditions or vegetation structure).
   Here, we used model caterpillars to study the effect of non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) on pest control in Central European forests. Model caterpillars were set at two strata (ground and herb layer) in 40 plots of five forest stand types. Monocultures of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Douglas fir and Norway spruce (Picea abies) and two-species mixtures of European beech and each of the conifers were studied. We analyzed plot-level attack rates (total, arthropod, bird, and mammal attack rates) in relation to stand type, stand composition and microhabitat variability.
   Against expectations, stands with a higher proportion of Douglas fir had higher total and arthropod attack rates. However, this effect was lessened in stands with higher tree species diversity. Indirect effects of Douglas fir were stronger than direct tree identity and proportion effects, with both increased light availability and understory vegetation complexity promoting attack rates. Therefore, promoting vegetation complexity and light availability by thinning, or planting more open Douglas fir stands with a lower stem density could help to promote pest control in forest stands of non-native tree species.

AB  - Natura 2000 is a network of protected areas for the conservation of ecological diversity and habitats in the European Union. The involvement of private and public actors in the implementation and management of the Natura 2000 sites is a pillar for the success of the network. The quality of participatory process is linked to the relational social capital (relationships among stakeholders and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them). This paper investigates the changes in relational social capital after the participatory process developed in drafting the Natura 2000 Management Programme (2015-2020) in Slovenia. Such changes were analysed through two main factors: level of trust in other stakeholders; and, conflicts between stakeholders. The results show an increase in the level of trust in public administrations and a simultaneous decrease in the level of trust in other stakeholders. The majority of respondents highlight the presence of four types of conflicts: conflicts due to restrictions to human activities; conflicts determined by an increase of bureaucratic procedures; conflicts caused by a not fully accepted definition of institutional roles; and, conflicts due to a lack of complete information about Natura 2000 requirements. Studies on the role of social capital in natural resources management could improve the quality of participatory process, by increasing mutual trust and by reducing conflicts between stakeholders. Future studies should focus on the role of social capital in managing natural resources in different socio-economic and cultural contexts.

AB  - In parallel with the current effects and responses to climate change ongoing changes of land use strongly affect alpine areas. The aim of this study was to analyse spider assemblages occurring on farmlands with differing stages of land use intensity. We collected the ground-dwelling spider fauna of semi-natural grasslands in currently farmed and abandoned farmland in the alpine zone of Hardangervidda, Norway, using pitfall traps. Trapping during the whole vegetation period resulted in 1,548 individuals belonging to 39 species of spiders. Linyphiids and lycosids dominated. The total number of species differ little between sites, but there was a general trend of increasing proportions of lycosids, gnaphosids and thomisids individuals and species, and a decrease in the proportion of linyphiids with farmland abandonment. Two main groupings of spider assemblages were found using a principal component analysis: One grouping was characteristic of intensely disturbed sites, mainly dominated by typical pioneer species. The other was characteristic of abandoned and less disturbed sites, dominated by widespread species. The abandonment of summer farms led to a succession in spider assemblages, including a decline in spider species with a high ballooning activity and an increase of species with a larger body size. We suggest that the main reason lies in the absence of disturbance by grazing including differing vegetation architecture and the proportion of bare ground with abandonment. Spider assemblages react quickly to environmental changes that occur in alpine habitats after abandonment. Thus, it is necessary to include spiders and other invertebrate animal indicator groups in field studies and experiments dealing with grazing impacts on alpine habitats.

AB  - 1. Freshwater communities are often structured by predation. In permanent lentic freshwater habitats dragonfly larvae are major predators which, in return, suffer predation by fish. Antipredator traits vary between the dragonfly species, and the dragonfly communities are therefore shaped by the presence of fish. But fish communities vary, and as different fish species affect dragonflies in different ways, the species composition of the fish community may affect the composition of the dragonfly community.
   2. We sampled dragonfly larvae in 24 lakes with a known fish stock in south-western Sweden, and explored the impact of fish as well as vegetation structure on dragonfly communities by means of multivariate analyses.
   3. We found that the presence of four fish species affected the community structure of dragonflies. The impact strength depended mainly on the abundance of Perca fluviatilis, with which most dragonfly species were negatively correlated. Many dragonfly species were also positively correlated with the occurrence of at least one fish species, which may reflect similar habitat requirements or imply indirect positive effects of these fish species.
   4. Of the 24 recorded dragonfly species, four did not occur in lakes dominated by P. fluviatilis, whereas only one species was lacking in lakes dominated by Rutilus rutilus. The dragonfly species diversity was higher in R. rutilus lakes than in P. fluviatilis lakes.
   5. Our results suggest that the fish species composition is a major determinant of the dragonfly community, which in turn will influence the lower trophic levels.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the most influential factors responsible for recent biodiversity decline. The key to understanding the changes in ecosystem functioning is the analysis of the relationship between species diversity and environmental gradients such as those found near streamside forests. We used soil mites (Mesostigmata) as model species as they are predators in soil ecosystems, they occur in high relative abundance, their communities are species-rich and are robust toward sampling and extraction methods. The main goals of this study were to (1) check how the plant community and associated environmental variables (light conditions, litter accumulation, and soil acidity) along mountain streams affect soil Mesostigmata abundance and diversity, and (2) to analyze the distance from mountain streams to which the ecosystem functions (Mesostigmata diversity) are affected, based on a distance gradient. We systematically established 31 study plots (500 m(2)) every 200 m along the watercourses, representing three habitat types along the stand composition gradient (ash-sycamore [Fraxinus excelsior-Acer pseudoplatanus], European beech [Fagus sylvatica], and Norway spruce [Picea abies] forests) for measurements of soil litter thickness, soil acidity, and light conditions. We extracted soil Mesostigmata mites from samples in Tullgren funnels and identified them to the species level. We found that Mesostigmata abundance in forests decreased in the following order: Norway spruce forest > European beech forest > ash-sycamore forest. Additionally, changes in Shannon diversity were associated with light conditions. In conclusion, streamside mountain forests maintained abundant, diverse and species-rich Mesostigmata communities, which were associated with a plant community-light condition gradient. Additionally, more abundant mite communities occurred in forests with higher soil pH values, and under higher light conditions.

AB  - Habitat formation by foundation species is a major ecological force affecting community structure in numerous systems. On the upper continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico, the cold-water scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa creates complex habitat on cold seep-associated carbonates. In this study, the communities associated with the cold-water coral L. pertusa are described from the Gulf of Mexico for the first time. A total of 68 taxa was identified in close association with the coral framework. Three species with specific relationships to L. pertusa were identified: Eunice sp., a polychaete which may facilitate colony formation in L. pertusa; Coralliophila sp., a species of corallivorous gastropod; and Stenopus sp., a decapod crustacean which may act in a cleaner shrimp role in these habitats. Similarity among coral-associated Communities was best explained by similarity in depth of collection and the proportion of live coral in the collections. These variables were somewhat confounded with location as the sites to the east were both shallower and contained higher proportions of live coral; however, distance between collections per se was not as significant in the analyses. The coral-associated communities also showed a low degree of similarity to communities inhabiting vestimentiferan tubeworm aggregations that occur nearby at the same sites. The increased habitat heterogeneity in the coral structure, differences in the niches constructed by the two foundation species, and different direct interspecific interactions between foundation species and members of the associated community contributed to the presence of dissimilar communities in these two biogenic habitats.

AB  - Streets comprise a major area of urban land use and connect built areas to one another. However, the role of streetscapes for maintaining urban plant diversity remains poorly understood. In this study, urban street vegetation was investigated in Oulu, Finland, and Yokohama, Japan, to explore how species richness and composition of plant communities change among different street habitat types, including road-verge grass beds, asphalted surfaces, stone pavements, curbside gaps, wall bases, street shrubbery, and tree bases. All plant species were recorded separately for different street habitat types along a maximum of 500 m of street sections. The gamma diversity of each habitat type and the contributions of native and exotic species were evaluated based on species accumulation curves. Plant species composition was examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling and Venn diagrams. A total of 145 and 273 species were recorded in Oulu and Yokohama, respectively. In Oulu, native species contributed more to the total diversity across habitat types, whereas in Yokohama, we observed similar contributions of native and exotic species to the total diversity. There was a large overlap in species occurrence among different habitat types in Oulu, where the road-verge grass beds included over 90 % of the total diversity, and all species present in asphalted habitats. Road verge grass beds in Oulu and street shrubbery in Yokohama include a large number of unique species, implying that these species have adapted to the environment in each habitat. Thus, streetscape vegetation includes a mixture of common urban species and some unique species depending on habitat type, which is often overlooked as a part of the spontaneous plant diversity across streetscapes. We propose that diverse street habitats, including both gray and green surfaces, support diverse plant species and may thereby create biodiverse urban streetscapes.

AB  - Urbanization changes landscape, causes destruction of natural habitats, and reduces species diversity. Urbanization can alter the interaction between fruit-bearing plants and frugivorous birds such as the Fieldfare, Turdus pilaris, and Bohemian waxwing, Bombycilla garrulus, which are the most abundant frugivorous bird species in Finland. Rowanberry, Sorbus aucuparia, is an ornamental tree species used commonly in the urban landscaping. It can promote bird diversity and the pleasantness of the urban environment for humans. The study was conducted on three spatial scales ranging from the macro scale (600 km latitudinal gradient) to the regional scale (rural vs. urban habitats), and to the micro scale (different tree parts) in three towns and their nearby rural areas in Finland. About 25 trees were photographed on each site three times during the autumn until the rowanberry fruit-crop had been used up. At the beginning of the research the crop size was larger on the urban trees than that of rural ones. The fruit removal rate was not related to the geographical location. However, in urban habitats the fruits were consumed later than in rural habitats. At the tree-level, the rowanberry fruits were removed earlier at the tops of trees. Our results suggest that earlier use of rowanberry fruits from rural habitats and tree tops may be related on human and predator-related disturbances. Our results indicated that urban rowanberry fruit crop is important food resource for frugivorous bird species in urban areas. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>1. Landscape simplification and habitat fragmentation may cause severe declines of less mobile and habitat specialist species and lead to biotic homogenization of species communities, but large-scale empirical evidence on biotic homogenization remains sparse.
   2. We sampled butterfly and day-active geometrid moth communities within 134 differently fragmented landscapes in Finland situated in five geographical regions. Overall species richness was partitioned into alpha and beta diversity and butterflies were assigned a species-specific mobility rank and habitat specificity score based on published ecological trait classifications.
   3. Alpha and beta diversity of butterflies and geometrid moths decreased with increasing agricultural intensity, independently of geographical position. The responses were either linear or nonlinear with accelerating decrease of diversity when arable field cover exceeded 60%.
   4. Mobility rank and percentage generalists of butterfly communities increased linearly with increasing field cover.
   5. In landscapes with high agricultural intensity (> 60% field coverage), the decrease in beta diversity of butterflies was strongly associated with an increasing proportion of habitat generalists and increasing average mobility in the butterfly communities. However, there was no such relationship in landscapes with low or moderate agricultural intensity.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that biotic homogenization caused by land-use change arises as a consequence of the loss of habitat specialists and poor dispersers in intensively cultivated landscapes with simplified landscape structure. Agri-environment schemes will therefore be inefficient in protecting high beta diversity unless they explicitly increase habitat availability and connectivity for habitat specialists and poor dispersers.

AB  - Simple Summary Current trends of human population growth and landscape development in Europe suggest that wildlife impacts will increase. Traditional methods to mitigate these impacts, such as culling, can be ineffective, environmentally harmful and often publicly opposed. Contraceptives might be an alternative to culling. This review focuses on contraceptives for mammals and birds, currently registered or widely tested, which might be considered for European wildlife. The review describes the effects of contraceptives on reproduction and welfare, the methods and challenges of contraceptive administration to large numbers of animals, the potential cost and feasibility of using fertility control and the knowledge gaps in this area. Contexts and species for using contraceptives to reduce the impacts of European wildlife include small, isolated wildlife populations, charismatic species and situations in which lethal control is either illegal or publicly unacceptable, such as urban environments and national parks. The review provides guidance to assist decisions about the potential use of wildlife fertility control and lists eight main reasons for Europe to invest in this area, and particularly in developing oral contraceptives which will allow large-scale applications of wildlife fertility control. This would be crucial for Europe, where humans and wildlife are increasingly sharing space and resources. Trends of human population growth and landscape development in Europe show that wildlife impacts are escalating. Lethal methods, traditionally employed to mitigate these impacts, are often ineffective, environmentally hazardous and face increasing public opposition. Fertility control is advocated as a humane tool to mitigate these impacts. This review describes mammalian and avian wildlife contraceptives' effect on reproduction of individuals and populations, delivery methods, potential costs and feasibility of using fertility control in European contexts. These contexts include small, isolated wildlife populations and situations in which lethal control is either illegal or socially unacceptable, such as urban settings, national parks and areas where rewilding occurs. The review highlights knowledge gaps, such as impact of fertility control on recruitment, social and spatial behaviour and on target and non-target species, provides a decision framework to assist decisions about the potential use of wildlife fertility control, and suggests eight reasons for Europe to invest in this area. Although developing and registering contraceptives in Europe will have substantial costs, these are relatively small when compared to wildlife's economic and environmental impact. Developing safe and effective contraceptives will be essential if European countries want to meet public demand for methods to promote human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - The kelp species Laminaria hyperborea constitutes highly productive kelp forest systems hosting a broad diversity of species and providing the basis for commercial kelp harvesting and, through its productivity, the fishing industry. Spatial planning and management of this important habitat and resource needs to be based on distribution maps and detailed knowledge of the main factors influencing the distribution. However, in countries with a long and complex coastline, such as Norway, detailed mapping is practically and economically difficult. Consequently, alternative methods are required. Based on modelled and field-measured geophysical variables and presence/absence data of L. hyperborea, a spatial predictive probability model for kelp distribution is developed. The influence of depth, slope, terrain curvature, light exposure, wave exposure, and current speed on the distribution of L. hyperborea are modelled using a generalized additive model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion, we found that the most important geophysical factors explaining the distribution of kelp were depth, terrain curvature, and wave and light exposure. The resulting predictive model was very reliable, showing good ability to predict the presence and absence of kelp.

AB  - We experimentally tested the conditions where heterospecific attraction is more likely to occur. The heterospecific attraction hypothesis predicts that colonizing or migrant individuals use the presence of resident species as a cue for profitable breeding sites. In other words, increasing resident densities will result in increased migrant densities until the costs of interspecific competition override the benefits of heterospecific attraction. The experiment consisted of a reference and a manipulation year. In the reference year, resident titmice were permitted to breed at intermediate densities whilst in the manipulation year, resident densities were manipulated in nine study plots. Three treatments were performed as low, intermediate and high resident densities and migrant density responses were measured in both years. Relative between-year migrant and resident densities were analyzed by regression analysis. Migrant foliage gleaning guild densities responded linearly and positively, as did densities of habitat generalists, in particular Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs),. The ground-foraging guild did not show a response. This study provides support for predictions of the heterospecific attraction hypothesis and suggests that information on habitat quality with reference to both food availability and safe breeding sites are important in using heterospecifics as cues. Based on Chaffinch response data, artificially increased resident densities were not high enough for competitive effects between residents and migrants to decrease heterospecific attraction. It seems unlikely that in northern environments natural resident densities will reach high levels where competitive effects would occur, therefore heterospecific attraction will always be beneficial. This study again shows the importance of heterospecific attraction in migrant habitat selection and as a process promoting species diversity in northern breeding bird assemblages.

AB  - Almost all productive Swedish forests have been managed for timber production for a long period of time. More sensitive so-called red-listed species are today restricted to small remnant habitats in a managed landscape matrix. It has been hypothesized that natural biodiversity can be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, blends natural structures and includes natural composition into the production forest. The most important restoration measures in Swedish boreal forests for promoting biodiversity are to increase the number and quality of undisturbed forests, the amounts of coarse woody debris, the number of deciduous trees, and to introduce fire as an ecological process.
   On the basis of current knowledge of natural forest dynamics, we here present management options for three major site types in boreal Sweden which mimic natural dynamics better than traditional forestry. In the natural stages, the sites carried (1) Scots pine forest, (2) deciduous or Norway spruce dominated forest, and (3) Norway spruce forest regenerated by so-called gap dynamics, respectively.
   The flora and fauna that characterize the first two, fire-influenced sites are considered relatively well-adapted to the kind of large-scale disturbances characterizing forestry. On these sites, therefore, the modifications proposed are within today's approach to applying the clear felling system. Sites that seldom experience fire may host species extremely sensitive to large-scale disturbances. If such sites are to be used for timber production, modified forestry practices using selection or shelterwood systems with relatively dense shelterwoods are suggested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The red turpentine beetle, Dendroctonus valens LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), colonizes all pines species within its native range throughout North and Central America. Recently, this species was accidentally introduced to China, where it has caused severe damage in pine forests. It belongs to a group of beetles that spend most of their lives between the tree bark and sapwood, where it feeds on phloem: a poor substrate with very low nutritional value of nitrogen and toxic properties due to its high content of secondary defensive compounds. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the D. valens gut by culture-dependent and -independent methods. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and ribosomal gene library analyses revealed that species diversity in the D. valens gut was relatively low, containing between six and 17 bacterial species. The bacterial community associated with larvae and adults was dominated by members of the following genera: Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Rahnella, Stenothrophomonas, Erwinia, Enterobacter, Serratia, Janibacter, Leifsonia, Cellulomonas, and Cellulosimicrobium. The members of the last four genera showed cellulolytic activity in vitro and could be involved in cellulose breakdown in the insect gut. Finally, nitrogen fixation was demonstrated in live larvae and adults; however, capacity of nitrogen fixing in vitro was not found among enterobacterial species isolated in nitrogen-free media; neither were nifD nor nifH genes detected. In contrast, nifD gen was detected in metagenomic DNA from insect guts. The identification of bacterial species and their potential physiological capacities will allow exploring the role of gut symbiotic bacteria in the adaptation and survival of D. valens in a harsh chemical habitat poor in nitrogen sources.

AB  - Semi-natural hay meadows are species rich habitats, formed by a long history of management and they have experienced a drastic decline all over Europe. There is a vast literature on conservation and species diversity of semi-natural hay-meadows, but very limited information on historic timing of hay cutting. We analyzed data collected between 1873 and 1951 on hay cutting dates and phenology of six plant species from farms distributed across Sweden. The data set comprised 16,015 observations from 175 sites. Results show that date of start and end of hay cutting varied across Sweden. The start of hay cutting was generally delayed by 2.2 days per latitudinal degree and 1.5 days per 100 m altitude, while the end of hay cutting was generally delayed by 2.9 days per latitudinal degree and 2.5 days per 100 m altitude. The average hay cutting period was 18.5 +/- 6.6 days, and became slightly shorter northwards. Site-specific factors had a great impact on when hay cutting was performed, as indicated by a significant correlation between flowering (and leafing) phenology in other species and start date of hay cutting. Today, management for conservation is usually related to a calendar date (e.g. regulated in eligibility criteria and requirements for payment in agri-environment programs in EU). In order to mimic historic management that formed this habitat, management should instead account for latitude and altitude, between-year variation in timing of hay cutting, variation in both start and end dates of hay cutting and if possible local phenological conditions.

KW  - CO(2) capture and storage

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is commonly regarded as a key element in the mitigatiion of climate change. CCS is of particular interest as it is able to address emissions from fossil fuel power stations, reducing CO(2) emissions by 80-90%, without a step change in technology or lifestyle within a country. This is of particular relevance for the large and growing coal fired power plant capacity in the developing world, particularly China and India.
   If CCS is going to make a significant impact on global CO(2) emissions then the development and deployment of the technology over the next 50 to 100 years will have to be significant. Currently however, the global awareness and education levels around CCS technology is low and mainly confined to the developed world. To meet the requirements of the future CCS industry this educational capacity must be increased.
   There are a number of key areas relating to the improvement of educational capacity.
   Informational dissemination
   Undergraduate studies
   Post-graduate research
   Professional training program
   The scope of this paper only includes the undergraduate and post-graduate areas. Post-graduate work in CCS is currently the best developed of the four areas of educational capacity. However the bulk of quality post-graduate research would still only emanatee from a small number of universities in developed countries. Undergraduate studies in CCS are currently non-existent. The only inclusion of CCS in undergraduate program currently is the mention of the general principles briefly as part of a much broader engineering program.
   This paper will look at international efforts to address the need to develop educational capacity in CCS. This will include looking at current training programs that exist such as the European CO2ReMoVe Course on CCS, the US-Norway Summer School for CCS, Research Experience in Carbon Sequestration (RECS), and the IEA GHG International Summer Schools on CCS. All the current programs are aimed at post-graduate students who are currently conducting research in a CCS relevant field and mainly focus on the developed world. The paper will discuss the history and outcomes of such programs to make some assessment of the impact these programs have had in the CCS industry.
   The paper will then go on to look at ways in which these could be expanded and developed in the future including how current educational programs could be extended or modified to address CCS education amongst undergraduate students. An assessment will also be made on how these programs could be transferred and initiated in the developing world. Finally the paper will go on to propose some new ways to improve CCS educational capacity for students around the world. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human-induced urban growth and sprawl have implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that may not be included in conventional GHG accounting methods. Improved understanding of this issue requires use of interactive, spatial-explicit social-ecological systems modeling. This paper develops a comprehensive approach to modeling GHG emissions from urban developments, considering Stockholm County, Sweden as a case study. GHG projections to 2040 with a social-ecological system model yield overall greater emissions than simple extrapolations in official climate action planning. The most pronounced difference in emissions (39% higher) from energy use single-residence buildings resulting from urban sprawl. And this difference is not accounted for in the simple extrapolations. Scenario results indicate that a zoning policy, restricting urban development in certain areas, can mitigate 72% of the total emission effects of the model-projected urban sprawl. The study outcomes include a decision support interface for communicating results and policy implications with policymakers.

AB  - The diversity and community composition of moths (both macro- and micromoths) at 32 sites, representing a wide range of habitat types (forests, grasslands, wetlands, agricultural and urban areas) within a restricted region in central Scania, southern-most Sweden, was investigated by use of light moth traps and compared with vascular plant species richness and habitat characteristics. The results revealed a highly significant general association between vegetation composition and the composition of the moth community and multivariate (CCA) analyses indicated light availability and soil fertility parameters (pH and macronutrients) to be the habitat characteristics that best correlated with moth community composition. Less strong, but still significant, positive relationships between moth abundance and local vascular plant diversity were also revealed. Moth species richness was positively correlated with diversity of woody plant genera in the neighborhood, but not with local vascular plant diversity in general. As for more general site characteristics, there were tendencies for higher moth richness and abundance at sites with more productive soils (well-drained, high pH, high nutrient availability), while shading/tree canopy cover, management, soil disturbance regimes and nectar production appeared unrelated to moth community parameters. It is concluded that local moth assemblages are strongly influenced by site characteristics and vegetation composition. Implications for insect conservation: The results show that obtaining moth data on a local scale is useful for conservation planning and does not need to be very cumbersome. Local moth assemblages monitored are indeed related to local site characteristics of conservation relevance.

AB  - We use public records from 1980 to 2014 to analyse survival of the EU Annex IV species Aeshna viridis in Sweden, a dragonfly strongly associated with the plant Stratiotes aloides. We clustered localities with S. aloides based on assumed dispersal abilities of A. viridis, using a dispersing radius of 2-100 km, calculating the proportion of sites with S. aloides that A. viridis is able to reach. If mean dispersal capability is high (40 km or above) 92.6 % or more of the localities are connected. For a good disperser, the probability of long-time survival is good. We further analysed the species richness of other Odonata and aquatic plants at 98 localities from the dataset. A. viridis co-occurred with more Odonata in the presence of S. aloides and running water but not in lakes. S. aloides sites had a higher number of other aquatic plants. Area had no impact on the occurrence of the species. For the present situation we surveyed 32 localities with known occurrence of the species. Only half of the sites for S. aloides contained any specimens while A. viridis occurred in the same number of sites. The species co-occurred in only 8 of 32 sites. In four sites A. viridis larvae appeared among Menyanthes trifoliata, Phragmites australis, Potamogeton natans and Sphagnum spp., indicating that at high latitudes A. viridis breeds among other species. Indirect monitoring based only on S. aloides would underestimate the number of populations of the dragonfly.

AB  - In Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany), an area with broad deciduous forests rich in tree species, we investigated relationships between tree-layer and regeneration diversity in consideration of deer browsing. In the 21 stands under investigation, which were characterised by closed canopies and a gradient from pure beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands to mixed stands with Lip to 11 deciduous tree species, we found that tree-layer and regeneration diversity were positively correlated (Tab. 3, Tab. 4, Fig. 4). But the composition of both strata differed considerably. In beech-dominated stands regeneration was more diverse than the tree layer, while in highly diverse stands the Situation was contrary (Fig. 2). Main tree species in the regeneration were sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Norway maple (Acer platanoides), and beech (Fagus sylvatica) (Fig, 3). Oaks (Quercus spp.), hornbeams (Carpinus betulus), and limes (Tilia spp.), which became more abundant in the canopy with increasing tree-layer diversity, were nearly absent in the regeneration. Quality and quantity of the regeneration were obviously negatively affected by increasing litter layer thickness and soil acidity, which varied due to canopy-species effects. Particularly beech foliage, which decomposes poorly and results in acid soil conditions, had a limiting effect oil regeneration. There were no significant correlations between quality and quantity of the regeneration and the irradiance transmitted through the closed canopy (Tab. 5). A secondary stand including higher regeneration was missing between canopy layer and small growing regeneration (Fig. 1). Presumably it was too dark for further growing of regeneration under the canopy of all investigated stands; deer browsing had intensified this effect. Browsing intensity was neither quantitatively nor qualitatively correlated with regeneration supply, but it was strongly related to vertical and horizontal tree-layer diversity (Fig. 5). Particularly former coppices with standards and selection stands with high tree-species richness offer protection from unpleasant weather in winter (thermal cover). This is made possible by Suppressed trees with low-set branches, which are a key stimulus for the habitat choice particularly of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus).

AB  - In recent decades, interest in understanding species distributions and exploring processes that shape species diversity has increased, leading to the development of advanced methods for the exploitation of occurrence data for analytical and ecological purposes. Here, with the use of georeferenced centipede data, we explore the importance and contribution of bioclimatic variables and land cover, and predict distribution ranges and potential hotspots in Norway. We used a maximum entropy analysis (Maxent) to model species' distributions, aiming at exploring centres of distribution, latitudinal spans and northern range boundaries of centipedes in Norway. The performance of all Maxent models was better than random with average test area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.893 and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values above 0.593. Our results showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient of increased species richness in southern grid-cells. Mean temperatures of warmest and coldest quarters explained much of the potential distribution of species. Predictive modelling analyses revealed that south-eastern Norway and the Atlantic coast in the west (inclusive of the major fjord system of Sognefjord), are local biodiversity hotspots with regard to high predictive species co-occurrence. We conclude that our predicted northward shifts of centipedes' distributions in Norway are likely a result of post-glacial recolonization patterns, species' ecological requirements and dispersal abilities.

AB  - Using data from 46 sites in southern Finland and ordination methods, we examined plant-environment relationships in boreal mesic semi-natural grasslands at two spatial scales (grain sizes), using plots of 0.25 ha and 1 x 1 m. We applied the variation partitioning approach to determine the pure fractions of environmental variable groups and their joint effects on plant species compositional variation in the studied grasslands. The variables related to land-use intensity and high nutrient level (especially phosphorus) had a major role in explaining the species composition at both scales, although soil heterogeneity and habitat characteristics also accounted for a notable amount of the species compositional variation at the 0.25 ha grain size. At the 1 x 1 m grain size, the majority of the species compositional variation was related to the "pure" spatial differences between the studied grasslands (i.e. the site identity (dummy 0/1) variable), whereas the impacts of within-site variation of local environmental factors were considerably smaller. High nutrient levels and variables related to low land-use intensity, e.g. litter accumulation, were also significantly correlated with floristic variation at the 1 x 1 m grain size. Rare and declining grassland species are associated with low-nutrient grassland sites and patches. The main recommendation for the management planning of boreal semi-natural grasslands is that the first restoration attempts should be targeted to areas where nutrient levels, particularly that of phosphorus, are relatively low. Soil properties and plant species composition can provide useful guidelines for defining the correct management procedures for different sites.

AB  - During the last millennia, all forests of the Italian Alps have been heavily affected by human land-use. Consequently, forest structures have been modified, and there are no old growth remains. In the last decades, however, many forests have been withdrawn from regular management, because wood production was unprofitable, and left to develop naturally. At the same time, in currently managed forests, silvicultural systems able to develop or maintain old-growth characteristics are being required. The aim of this paper was to assess the status and developmental dynamics of old-growth characteristics in mixed beech, silver fir, and Norway spruce montane forests of the eastern Italian Alps. We selected along a naturalness gradient (a) three old-growth forests in Bosnia and Montenegro (due to the lack of old-growth forests in the Italian Alps), (b) two forests withdrawn from regular management for at least 50 years, and (c) three currently managed forests. In each forest, we analysed 17 structural attributes, in order to assess their value as indicators of old-growth condition. Old-growth forests were characterized by significantly higher amounts of live and dead biomass, share of beech in the dominant and regeneration layers, and number of large trees. The diameter distribution was best described as a rotated sigmoid, differently from currently and formerly managed forest. We discuss the differences in old-growth characteristics across the management gradient and use our results to evaluate the effectiveness of retention prescriptions currently applied in the studied regions in maintaining or promoting old-growth structural attributes in managed forests.

AB  - One of the most important threats to peatland ecosystems is drainage, resulting in encroachment of woody species. Our main aim was to check which features - overstorey or understorey vegetation - are more important for shaping the seedling bank of pioneer trees colonising peatlands (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens). We hypothesised that tree stand parameters will be more important predictors of natural regeneration density than understorey vegetation parameters, and the former will be negatively correlated with species diversity and richness and also with functional richness and functional dispersion, which indicate a high level of habitat filtering. The study was conducted in the Zielone Bagna' nature reserve (NW Poland). We assessed the structure of tree stands and natural regeneration (of B.pubescens and P.sylvestris) and vegetation species composition. Random forest and DCA were applied to assess relationships between variables studied. Understorey vegetation traits affected tree seedling density (up to 0.5-m height) more than tree stand traits. Density of older seedlings depended more on tree stand traits. We did not find statistically significant relationships between natural regeneration densities and functional diversity components, except for functional richness, which was positively correlated with density of the youngest tree seedlings. Seedling densities were higher in plots with lower functional dispersion and functional divergence, which indicated that habitat filtering is more important than competition. Presence of an abundant seedling bank is crucial for the process of woody species encroachment on drained peatlands, thus its dynamics should be monitored in protected areas.

AB  - Protected forest areas (PFAs) are key features of biodiversity conservation, and knowledge about long-term development is crucial in evaluating their efficiency and management needs. Longitudinal data on forest structure in PFAs is uncommon and often from small areas. Here we use data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to study changes in more than 750 000 ha of PFAs over 60 years. Structures important for biodiversity, e.g., number of large trees and the volume of hard deadwood, including both standing and down wood, have more than doubled. The initial volume of deadwood, however, was very low. The overall tree species composition was stable over time, and only among the largest trees were there indications of a shift towards the late successional Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Deadwood increased independent of species, size of wood, and site characteristics. This increase was positively related to the volume of living trees and forest age. We conclude that Swedish PFAs, in the absence of active management and under fire suppression at the landscape scale, develop structural components that are crucial for conservation of biodiversity. However, although tree species composition appears stable, present disturbance regimes in the PFAs are considerably different from those in naturally dynamic forests, which may have implications for long-term biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - Climate change mitigation trade-offs between increasing harvests to exploit substitution effects versus accumulating forest carbon sequestration complicate recommendations for climate beneficial forest management. Here, a time dynamic assessment ascertains climate change mitigation potential from different rotation forest management alternatives across three Swedish regions integrating the forest decision support system Heureka RegWise with a wood product model using life cycle assessment data. The objective is to increase understanding on the climate effects of varying the forest management. Across all regions, prolonging rotations by 20% leads on average to the largest additional net climate benefit until 2050 in both, saved emissions and temperature cooling, while decreasing harvests by 20% leads to the cumulatively largest net climate benefits past 2050. In contrast, increasing harvests or decreasing the rotation period accordingly provokes temporally alternating net emissions, or slight net emission, respectively, regardless of a changing market displacement factor. However, future forest calamities might compromise potential additional temperature cooling from forests, while substitution effects, despite probable prospective decreases, require additional thorough and time explicit assessments, to provide more robust policy consultation.

AB  - The appropriate management of forest reserves is debated; two major alternatives are succession to 'wild' state, or management to produce semi-open stands. For temperate conservation stands, there are no strong experiments replicated at landscape level. In each of 22 forests rich in oaks (Quercus spp.) in Sweden, we set up a closed-canopy wild plot (1 ha), and a cutting plot (1 ha) to produce semi-open conditions, studying them before and after cutting. About 25% of the tree basal area was cut (large trees and dead wood retained) and harvested as bio-fuel, a CO2-neutral energy source. We examined the response of beetles and trapped 59,000 individuals (1174 species; 100 red-listed species). For both the guild of herbivorous beetles (222 species) and of saproxylic beetles connected to oak wood (267 species), species richness increased by about 35% in the harvested plots, relative to the wild reference plots. Species composition within the groups changed, though not strongly. Thirteen saproxylic species of 50 analysed, and three herbivores of 12 increased in cutting plots. For red-listed saproxylic beetles, species richness did not change significantly. Regression analyses suggest that more open cutting plots disfavour the red-listed beetles of this forest type. Thus, partial cutting increased species diversity of two beetle groups, probably due to changed microclimate and increase in herbaceous plants, but some red-listed saproxylic beetles may be disfavoured. A hands-off alternative may through storms and other disturbances produce open patches, more dead wood, and favour some species. Combinations of these alternatives, carefully planned at the landscape level, need to be considered. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights has sailed up as one of the most critical issues in land use planning, globally. In this paper, we use a recent planning process for a national park on traditional Sami territory in northern Sweden to demonstrate how state officials engaged in everyday conservation planning are pivotal in navigating colonial legislation and promoting policy change on Indigenous rights. The analysis contributes, among other, to scholarly debates about the role of conflict in land use planning and the practices of frontline bureaucrats in natural resource governance. Our contribution demonstrates the value of an agonistic lens that attends to the constructive role of conflict in democratic change in pluralistic societies. This concerns both how state officials approach disagreement as well as the way contestation can create novel spaces to promote structural changes towards sustainability and justice. By not assuming collaboration but respectfully seeking it, the state officials succeeded in re-designing a collapsed process to help actors explore larger structural issues around Indigenous rights and government policy. In our agnostic reading, then, contestation should be perceived not as oppositional to the establishment of collaboration but as a necessary, and productive, part of inclusive land use planning.

AB  - In this study, we report on 67 years of secondary succession in the temperate deciduous forest Dalby Sbderskog, southern Sweden. In 2002 vegetation analyses were conducted in 74 systematically distributed plots and the results compared with similar investigations during the years 1935, 1969 and 1976. Additionally, a floristic survey of the forest was made and compared with inventories of the years 1925, 1935 and 1970. From 1970 to 2002, overall species richness of the forest continued to decline, but at a lower rate than before. In 2002, for the first time, shade-tolerant forest species constituted the largest group. In the upper tree layer Fraxinus excelsior became the most important species, at the expense of Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra. In the herb layer, no changes in total or mean species richness were exhibited at plot scale between 1976 and 2002. In contrast to the lack of quantitative changes in species richness, we observed major changes in species composition at the plot level. In particular, the former dominant species Mercurialis perennis had declined markedly. After release from a historical regime of livestock grazing and irregular cuttings, the predicted steady-state community dominated by Ulmus and Mercurialis only prevailed for a few decades before unexpected external events, in this particular case Dutch elm disease and invasion by the slug Arion lusitanicus, initiated a successional change. We conclude that unexpected diseases or pests or rare climatic extremes can play a decisive role in forest dynamics and strongly interact with more gradual autogenic changes of forest structure and composition.

AB  - Boreal forests sequester and store vast carbon (C) pools that may be subject to significant feedback effects induced by climatic warming. The boreal landscape consists of a mosaic of forests and peatlands with wide variation in total C stocks, making it important to understand the factors controlling C pool sizes in different ecosystems. We therefore quantified the total C stocks in the organic layer, mineral soil, and tree biomass in 430 plots across a 68 km(2) boreal catchment. The organic layer held the largest C pool, accounting for 39% of the total C storage; tree and mineral C pools accounted for 38% and 23%, respectively. The size of the soil C pool was positively related to modelled soil moisture conditions, especially in the organic soil layer (R-2 = 0.50). Conversely, the tree C pool exhibited a unimodal relationship: storage was highest under intermediate wetness conditions. The magnitude and variation in the total soil C stocks observed in this work were comparable to those found at the national level in Sweden, suggesting that C accumulation in boreal landscapes is more sensitive to local variation resulting primarily from differences in soil moisture conditions than to regional differences in climate, nitrogen deposition, and parent material.

AB  - Long-term field experiments at Abisko, Sweden, and Toolik Lake, Alaska, reveal both similarities and differences in response of contrasting Arctic ecosystems to changes in temperature, light, and nutrient availability. Five different ecosystems were manipulated for 5-15 years by increasing air temperature with greenhouses, by decreasing light with shading, and by increasing available N and P with fertilizers. The ecosystems at Abisko included evergreen-dominated heath and fellfield sites; at Toolik Lake they included wet sedge tundra, moist tussock tundra, and dry heath tundra. In all ecosystems, fertilizer treatment increased plant growth, production, and/ or biomass. Plant responses to warming were smaller and occasionally nonsignificant. Responses to shading were generally nonsignificant after 3-6 years, although after 9 years the tussock tundra showed significant decreases in biomass. In general, the ecosystems at Abisko were less responsive to nutrients and more responsive to temperature than the ecosystems at Toolik Lake. Overall, though, the sites were quite similar in their responses to the perturbations, increasing our confidence in predictions of response to climate change over large areas based on small-area studies.

AB  - Natural hazards resulting from climate change are increasing in frequency and intensity. As this is not a linear trend but rather by singularities and anomalies including a broad spectrum of climatic and weather extremes with high temporal and spatial uncertainty focused avoidance strategies are difficult to prepare. However, the effects of climate change are mostly addressed with outdated 'business as usual' approaches by governments and most stakeholders, which are unfit to tackle the complexity of current challenges. Coping action for natural hazards is mostly undertaken during and after such events compensating damage through payments and restoration. In the future, pro-active nature-based solutions are needed for risk mitigation and avoiding severe damage through enhancing all facets of biodiversity from species richness, structural roughness, to spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems. This will not avoid extreme weather events, but it will reduce the damage of increasingly appearing natural hazards. However, this strategy cannot be implemented all of a sudden. Long-term and spatial concepts are needed. For this purpose, currently missing governance structures based on geographical, geoscientific, ecological, meteorological, and societal expertise should be installed. In recent years, a good scientific and knowledge basis for the required solutions has been developed, which now must translate into action. Here, a series of suggestions is compiled for a broad spectrum of extreme events and societal fields, which is far from being complete but should stimulate critically needed creativity and commitment. Nature-based solutions will not deliver a complete protection and cannot be the only kind of action, but we can no longer rely on post-disaster compensation or on the safety illusion of mere engineering and construction works. The efficiency of biodiversity as an insurance for maintaining ecosystem services is well understood. The implementation of nature-based adaptation, coping, and protection measures is less expensive than traditional end-of-the-pipe constructions. It requires an in-depth understanding of interacting processes and trans-disciplinary cooperation based on a broad acceptance in the public. Investments into these solutions would pay off, not tomorrow, but in the future. It is the best sustainable and feasible approach for disaster prevention.

AB  - Abundance, biofacies and ATP content of benthic foraminifera(> 63 mu m) were studied in the Northeast Water (NEW) Polynya (77-81 degrees N, 5-17 degrees W) over the ice-free summer, 1993, to investigate how a polynya system might influence the underlying benthic community. In the living assemblage, distinguished by Rose Bengal staining, over 60 taxa could be identified. The biofacies identified was similar to that of other Arctic shelf habitats. Foraminifera were counted in 3 size fractions (63-125 mu m, 125-250 mu m and > 250 mu m), with 65% of the foraminifera occurring in the smallest size fraction (63-125 mu m). Total abundances(> 63 mu m) in the uppermost 1 cm averaged approximately 200 ind/10 cm(3) and declined down-core, as did the number of species. Abundances and species composition correlated positively with sediment chlorophyll and ATP content, with maxima occurring in the shallower northern regions of the polynya, suggesting a general dependence on food. Foraminifera biomass was estimated to be 0.1-0.3 g C-org/m(2). Abundances: biomass and ATP content were comparable to ice-free, deep-sea regions in the Norwegian Sea. Temporal changes observed over a 2 month period at one location were difficult to distinguish from spatial and analytical variability. Contrary to expectations, growth was unpronounced at the community and at a species level, implying either a delayed response of the benthic foraminiferal community to food inputs from the overlying water column or the presence of biological limitations other than food, such as predation.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the macrofungi communities of five forest types in Wunvfeng National Forest Park (Jilin, China) by collecting fruiting bodies from 2019-2021. Each forest type had three repeats and covered the main habitats of macrofungi. In addition, we evaluate selected environmental variables and macrofungi communities to relate species composition to potential environmental factors. We collected 1235 specimens belonging to 283 species, 116 genera, and 62 families. We found that Amanitaceae, Boletaceae, Russulaceae, and Tricholomataceae were the most diverse family; further, Amanita, Cortinarius, Lactarius, Russula, and Tricholoma were the dominant genera in the area. The macrofungi diversity showed increasing trends from Pinus koraiensis Siebold et Zuccarini forests to Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour forests. The cumulative species richness was as follows: Q. mongolica forest A > broadleaf mixed forest B > Q. mongolica, P. koraiensis mix forest D (Q. mongolica was the dominant species) > Q. mongolica and P. koraiensis mix forest C (P. koraiensis was the dominant species) > P. koraiensis forest (E). Ectomycorrhizal fungi were the dominant functional group; they were mainly in forest type A and were influenced by soil moisture content and Q. mongolica content (p < 0.05). The wood-rotting fungus showed richer species diversity than other forest types in broadleaf forests A and B. Overall, we concluded that most fungal communities preferred forest types with a relatively high Q. mongolica content. Therefore, the deliberate protection of Q. mongolica forests proves to be a better strategy for maintaining fungal diversity in Wunvfeng National Forest Park.

AB  - In 2007, the Norwegian Ministry of Environment initiated an unprecedented project of environmental conservation through land use planning, introducing buffer zones as measures to integrate local development with conservation of wild reindeer. Through studies of national policy developments and a case study of a planning processes and spatial zoning, using institutional theory, the paper investigates how competing policies and understandings of appropriate activities in the edge areas are reflected in zoning regulations and planning practice, and whether the buffer zone contributes to resolving conflicts in the edge areas. Competing national policies for the edge areas, a legal development favoring ecological buffering and a history of top-down management and local socio-economic marginalization results in removal of large parts of an existing ecological buffer zone and the creation of a new development zone. The integrated conservation and development approach has no advocates and while bearing much promise amounts to little.

AB  - Intensive management of Fennoscandian forests has led to a mosaic of woodlands in different stages of maturity. The main rodent host of the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a species that can be found in all woodlands and especially mature forests. We investigated the influence of forest age structure on PUUV infection dynamics in bank voles. Over four years, we trapped small mammals twice a year in a forest network of different succession stages in Northern Finland. Our study sites represented four forest age classes from young (4 to 30 years) to mature (over 100 years) forests. We show that PUUV-infected bank voles occurred commonly in all forest age classes, but peaked in mature forests. The probability of an individual bank vole to be PUUV infected was positively related to concurrent host population density. However, when population density was controlled for, a relatively higher infection rate was observed in voles trapped in younger forests. Furthermore, we found evidence of a "dilution effect" in that the infection probability was negatively associated with the simultaneous density of other small mammals during the breeding season. Our results suggest that younger forests created by intensive management can reduce hantaviral load in the environment, but PUUV is common in woodlands of all ages. As such, the Fennoscandian forest landscape represents a significant reservoir and source of hantaviral infection in humans.

AB  - When restoring former agricultural land to more low-nutrient input ecosystems, the establishment of a plant community can be enhanced by sowing desirable species. In this study our aim was to determine whether management of the plant community influences the microarthropod community. We carried out a field experiment in three European countries on set-aside arable land and determined soil mites from the sites in Sweden, The Netherlands and Spain. Experimental plots on set-aside arable land were sown with high (15 species) or low (4 species) plant species seed mixtures-, other plots were colonized naturally. A field with continued agricultural practices and a later successional site (target site) were used for comparison with the experimental plots. Soil from the later successional site was inoculated into half of the plots. Abandoning agricultural practices increased the density of mites at one site while the number of mite species was not affected. Sowing plant seeds had no effect on mite densities at any of the sites. The community composition of mites changed in response to management of the plant community, as shown by canonical correspondence analysis. Among the functional groups of mites, saprophytes generally dominated on all plots at all sites. Mites parasitic on insects were not present on fields with continued agricultural practice in Sweden and The Netherlands, and might thus be regarded as an indicator of an increase in trophic complexity in the sown and naturally colonized treatments. Predatory and plant parasitic mites showed no consistent pattern in relation to the treatments of the three sites. Soil inoculation treatment had only a minor impact on the soil mite communities.

AB  - Spatial pattern has a key role in the interactions between species in plant communities. These interactions influence ecological processes involved in the species dynamics: growth, regeneration and mortality. In this study, we investigated the effect of spatial pattern on productivity in mature mixed forests of sessile oak and Scots pine. We simulated tree locations with point process models and tree growth with spatially explicit individual growth models. The point process models and growth models were fitted with field data from the same stands. We compared species productivity obtained in two types of mixture: a patchy mixture and an intimate mixture. Our results show that the productivity of both species is higher in an intimate mixture than in a patchy mixture. Productivity difference between the two types of mixture was 11.3 % for pine and 14.7 % for oak. Both species were favored in the intimate mixture because, for both, intraspecific competition was more severe than interspecific competition. Our results clearly support favoring intimate mixtures in mature oak-pine stands to optimize tree species productivity; oak is the species that benefits the most from this type of management. Our work also shows that models and simulations can provide interesting results for complex forests with mixtures, results that would be difficult to obtain through experimentation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycle processes in terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature and soil moisture variations. Thus, future climate change may affect the degree to which N deposited from the atmosphere will be retained in forest ecosystems. We evaluated the effect of future changes in climate and N deposition on ecosystem N cycling using the model LandscapeDNDC forced with historical data from eight long-term forest ecosystem monitoring stations in Austria and downscaled future N deposition and climate scenarios. With every 1 A degrees C of warming, annual N uptake in biomass increased by +0.03 to +0.54 kg N ha(-1), total soil organic matter (SOM) increased annually by +0.003 to +0.08 kg N ha(-1), and mean annual N leaching was between -0.09 and -2.03 kg N ha(-1) lower. The magnitude of N deposition in the years from 1990 to 2010 was by far the most important determinant of the response of nitrogen cycling to future warming, including statistically significant relationships with humus N content and N leaching. We conclude that climate change will likely increase ecosystem N retention in temperate forest ecosystems, and even more so at forest sites with high past N deposition.

AB  - The responses of ground beetles to an urbanisation gradient (forest-suburban area-urban park) were studied in and near Soro, South Zealand, Denmark, during April-October 2004. The average number of species per trap did not differ significantly among the three urbanisation stages. The average number of forest species was significantly higher in the forest area (6.2 species/trap) than in either the suburban (4.12 spp/trap) or the urban (3.7 spp/trap) areas. Both the number of open-habitat species (1.8 spp/trap), and the generalist species (2.3 spp/trap) were highest in the urban area. The number of predaceous species was highest in the forest area (8.1 spp/trap), while the number of omnivorous species was highest in the urban area (0.9 spp/trap). Multivariate statistical procedures (NMDS, Sorensen similarity index) also confirmed that species composition changed remarkably along the forest-suburban-urban gradient. The highest number of species (S = 37) was found at the urban area, deviating from trends at other northern hemisphere sites (Canada, Finland) where the overall species richness was highest at the forest habitats. Urban green areas, including forest patches contribute to the quality of urban life and thus should be conserved. Apart from their recreational value, which is widely appreciated and enjoyed by human inhabitants, such green urban spaces provide seemingly adequate habitat for numerous species of ground beetles found in less developed forest areas some distance from the city core.

AB  - 1 The Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method was used to investigate genetic diversity of anholocyclic populations of the green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum Walker, in north-west Europe.
   2 The results showed that the aphid in this region was divided genetically into three major groups. Aphids from the British Isles and north-west France comprised the first group, the second group consisted of aphids from Denmark and Iceland, and the third group consisted of aphids from Norway.
   3 The results indicated a significant level of gene flow within and between sites and geographical regions, especially in the British Isles and north-west France. Lateral migration of the aphid and/or sexual reproduction is likely to have facilitated the gene flow.
   4 The implications of these findings on management of the green spruce aphid are discussed.

AB  - We subjected a unique set of high-quality paleoecological data to statistical modeling to examine if the biological richness and evenness of freshwater diatom communities in the Falun area, a historical copper (Cu) mining region in central Sweden, was negatively influenced by 1000 years of metal exposure. Contrary to ecotoxicological predictions, we found no negative relation between biodiversity and the sedimentary concentrations of eight metals. Strikingly, our analysis listed metals (Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) or the fractional land cover of cultivated crops, meadow, and herbs indicating land disturbance as potentially promoting biodiversity. However, correlation between metal-and land-cover trends prevented concluding which of these two covariate types positively affected biodiversity. Because historical aqueous metal concentrations-inferred from solid-water partitioning-approached experimental toxicity thresholds for freshwater algae, positive effects of metal mining on biodiversity are unlikely. Instead, the positive relationship between biodiversity and historical land-cover change can be explained by the increasing proportion of opportunistic species when anthropogenic disturbance intensifies. Our analysis illustrates that focusing on the direct toxic effects of metals alone may yield inaccurate environmental assessments on time scales relevant for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Seagrass meadows constitute important carbon sinks, and the ongoing global loss of seagrass habitats raises concerns about the release of carbon stored in their sediments. However, the actual consequences of seagrass loss for the release of carbon and nutrients remain unclear. Here, we take advantage of well-documented historic losses of eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows along the Swedish NW coast to assess how the contents of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the sediment change when a meadow is lost. We find unusually high contents of C and N (on average 3.7% and 0.39% DW, respectively) in Swedish eelgrass sediments down to >100 cm depth, suggesting that these habitats constitute global hot spots for C and N storage. However, the C and N stocks were strongly influenced by wave exposure and were almost twice as high in sheltered compared to exposed eelgrass meadows. The sediment composition and stable isotope values were distinctly different in areas that have lost eelgrass meadows, with on average >2.6 times lower contents of C and N. The results indicate an erosion of >35 cm sediment following the historical eelgrass loss, and that sheltered meadows have more vulnerable sediment stocks. The results suggest that eelgrass loss has resulted in a release of 60.2 Mg C and 6.63 Mg N per hectare, with an estimated economic cost to society of 7944 and 141,355 US$/ha, respectively. The value of N storage represents one of the highest monetary values presented for an ecosystem service provided by seagrasses and shows that Swedish eelgrass meadows are particularly important for mitigating eutrophication. Following a documented loss of approximately 10 km(2) of eelgrass in the study area, it is estimated that over 60,000 Mg of nitrogen was released to the coastal environment over a 20-yr period, which constitutes over three times the annual river load of nitrogen to the Swedish NW coast. The study exemplifies the significant role of seagrass sediments as sinks for both carbon and nutrients, and that the risk of nutrient release following vegetation loss should be taken into account in the spatial management of seagrass and other coastal habitats.

AB  - Background: A novel way to study the species composition and diversity of nematode parasites in livestock is to perform deep sequencing on composite samples containing a mixture of different species. Herein we describe for the first time the nematode community structures (nemabiomes) inhabiting Swedish sheep and how these are/were affected by host age and recent anthelmintic treatments.
   Methods: A total of 158 fecal samples were collected (n = 35 in 2007 and n = 123 in 2013-2016) and cultured from groups of sheep on 61 commercial farms in the south-central part of the country where most animals are grazed. Among the samples, 2 x 44 (56%) were paired collections from the same groups pre- and post-treatment with anthelmintics such as macrocyclic lactones, benzimidazoles or levamisole. Samples were analyzed for their nemabiome using the PacBio platform followed by bioinformatic sequence analysis with SCATA. Species richness and diversity were calculated and analyzed in R.
   Results: Nematode ITS2 sequences were found in all larval culture samples except two, even though the fecal egg counts were below the McMaster threshold in 20 samples. Sequencing yielded, on average, 1008 sequences per sample. In total, 16 operational taxonomical units (OTU), all with >= 98 % identity to sequences in the NCBI database, were recognized. The OTUs found represented nematode species of which ten are commonly associated with sheep. Multiple species were identified in all pre-anthelmintic treatment larval culture samples. No effects on nematode diversity were found in relation to host age. On the other hand, recent anthelmintic treatment lowered species richness, especially after use of ivermectin and albendazole. Interestingly, despite zero egg counts after use of levamisole, these samples still contained nematode DNA and especially H. contortus.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that nemabiome analysis combined with diversity index analysis provides an objective methodology in the study of the efficacy of anthelmintic treatment as both high and low abundant species were detected.

AB  - 1. System Aqua has been designed to meet the growing need for an objective, reproducible and comprehensive tool for assessing the conservation value of lakes and watercourses in Sweden. The system may be used to provide an integrated assessment of whole catchments as well as their component waters. Emphasis is placed on biological qualities, with biodiversity as a focal concept.
   2. Biodiversity is evaluated by five criteria characterized by indicators, varying in number from three to five. The criteria are structural diversity, naturalness, rarity, species richness and representativeness, and the biotic groups evaluated consist of riparian vegetation, macrophytes, algae, macroinvertebrates, fish and nesting birds.
   3. Indicators are scored from 0 to 5, where 5 reflects the highest biodiversity or the highest natural value, and 0 an extremely uniform or highly impacted habitat.
   4. A numerical index value, based on weighted scores of assessed indicators, is obtained for each criterion. The indices are presented in an easily understandable criteria profile, where the proportion of indicators used reflects the confidence of the assessment.

The downcore distribution of the dinocysts is discussed in view of changes in key hydrographic parameters of the surface waters (sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), sea-surface salinities (SSSs), and river discharges) monitored in the fjord. We examine the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern and of waste water supply from the local industry and agriculture on the fjord ecological state and thus dinocyst species diversity. Our results show that dinocyst production and diversity in the fjord is not evidently affected by human-induced eutrophication. Instead the assemblages appear to be mainly controlled by the NAO-related changes in nutrient availability and the physicochemical characteristics of the surface mixed layer. Still, discharges of major rivers have been modulated since 1985 by the implementation of hydropower plants, which certainly influences the amounts of nutrients supplied to the fjord. The impact, however, is variable according to the local geographical setting, and barely differentiated from natural changes in river run off.
   We ultimately test the use of the modern analogue technique (MAT) for the reconstruction of winter and summer SSTs and SSSs and annual primary productivity (PP) in this particular fjord setting. The reconstructed data are compared with time series of summer and winter SSTs and SSSs measured at 10m water depth, as well as with mean annual PPs along the Norwegian coast and in Scandinavian fjords. The reconstructions are generally in good agreement with the instrumental measurements and observations from other fjords. Major deviations can be attributed to peculiarities in the assemblages linked to the particular fjord setting and the related hydrological structure.

AB  - Mining and related industries are a major source of metal pollution. In contrast to the well-studied effects of exposure to metals on animal physiology and health, the impacts of environmental metal pollution on the gut microbiota of wild animals are virtually unknown. As the gut microbiota is a key component of host health, it is important to understand whether metal pollution can alter wild animal gut microbiota composition. Using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantification of metal levels in kidneys, we assessed whether multi-metal exposure (the sum of normalized levels of fifteen metals) was associated with changes in gut microbiota of wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from two locations in Finland. Exposure to increased metal load was associated with higher gut microbiota species diversity (alpha-diversity) and altered community composition (beta-diversity), but not dispersion. Multi-metal exposure and increased levels of several metals (Cd, Hg, Pb and Se) were associated with differences in the abundance of microbial taxa, especially those within the families Clostridiales vadinBB60 group, Desulfovibrionaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Muribaculaceae and Ruminococcaceae. Our data indicate that even low-level metal pollution can affect the diversity of microbiota and be associated with deterministic differences in composition of host gut microbiota in wild animal populations. These findings highlight the need to study a broader range of metals and their cocktails that are more representative of the types of environmental exposure experienced by wild animals.

AB  - Nineteen populations of Sphagnum affine were included in a study of genetic diversity and structure in fragmented and less fragmented landscapes, and differentiation at intercontinental and three regional levels. Isozyme electrophoresis of eight enzyme systems revealed 12 variable loci, which could be used for haplotype identification. A hierachical analysis of variance (AMOVA) revealed no significant intercontinental differentiation, and very limited differentiation among European regions. A trend of decreasing diversity with increasing latitude was apparent. Gametic phase disequilibria was high, suggesting nonrandom mating and regionally high incidences of inbreeding. The partitioning of genetic variation within and among populations in each region varied among regions, the northernmost populations having 86% of the total variation among populations, the southernmost in Scandinavia having 25% of the variation among populations, whereas the American populations displayed 89% of the variation within populations. Fifteen alleles at eight loci occurred in the U.S.A. which were not encountered in Europe, whereas only three European alleles at one locus in three populations were not encountered in U.S.A.
   The differences in diversity between North America and Europe may result from loss of genetic diversity caused by founder effects during postglacial recolonization of northern Europe. In Europe, the main mountain ranges extend E-W, posing severe barriers to northwards migration of lowland species, compared to the N-S trend of mountain ranges in North America. The decline in genetic diversity and increase in population differentiation and gametic phase disequilibria towards the north in Scandinavia may be caused by a series of founder effects during postglacial migration. These may have corresponded to minor climatic oscillations that influenced the migration front/leading edge in the suboceanic lowlands of Norway. According to this model random genetic drift will be an increasingly important structuring factor with latitude.

AB  - The vascular plant flora of open land on superficial bedrock in southern Sweden (northwards to 59 degrees N) is described and related to soil chemical properties, including soil acidity (pH), exchangeable Al, Ca, Fe, Mn, Mg, and phosphate, as well as to soil solution pH and concentrations of Al, Ca and Mg, and to the contents of soil organic matter, soil depth and bedrock types (sandstone, gneiss, granites, various dark igneous rocks and limestones). About 120 localities with totally 652 sites (4 m(2)) have been examined. Experimental evidence for the toxicity of acid soils and mineral nutrient deficiency of neutral and alkaline soils is related to field data. Hydrogen and Al ion toxicity in acid soils and low phosphate solubility in neutral - alkaline soils are identified as major factors limiting the field distributions of rock habitat plants. Some species (e.g., Rumex acetosella and Sedum telephium) were limited by phosphate also in acid soils. The relative importance of H and Al ion concentrations to plant performance under variously acid soil conditions is discussed, and strong evidence is given for a decisive influence of Al ion toxicity on species diversity at pH-KCl < 4.5. The importance of grazing and former land use is considered briefly and the floristic differences between the western and the eastern half of the study area are discussed originating from differences in general distribution patterns of species and soil chemical properties.

AB  - A framework for the inclusion of land use impact assessment and a set of land use impact indicators has been recently proposed for life cycle assessment (LCA) and no case studies are available for forest biomass. The proposed methodology is tested for Scandinavian managed forestry; a comparative case study is made for energy from wood, agro-biomass and peat; and sensitivity to forest management options is analysed.
   The functional unit of this comparative case study is 1 GJ of energy in solid fuels. The land use impact assessment framework of the United Nations Environment Programme and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP-SETAC) is followed and its application for wood biomass is critically analysed. Applied midpoint indicators include ecological footprint and human appropriation of net primary production, global warming potential indicator for biomass (GWP(bio)-100) and impact indicators proposed by UNEP-SETAC on ecosystem services and biodiversity. Options for forest biomass land inventory modelling are discussed. The system boundary covers only the biomass acquisition phase. Management scenarios are formulated for forest and barley biomass, and a sensitivity analysis focuses on impacts of land transformations for agro-biomass.
   Meaningful differences were found in between solid biofuels from distinct land use classes. The impact indicator results were sensitive to land occupation and transformation and differed significantly from inventory results. Current impact assessment method is not sensitive to land management scenarios because the published characterisation factors are still too coarse and indicate differences only between land use types. All indicators on ecosystem services and biodiversity were sensitive to the assumptions related with land transformation. The land occupation (m(2)a) approach in inventory was found challenging for Scandinavian wood, due to long rotation periods and variable intensities of harvests. Some suggestions of UNEP-SETAC were challenged for the sake of practicality and relevance for decision support.
   Land use impact assessment framework for LCA and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) indicators could be applied in a comparison of solid bioenergy sources. Although forest bioenergy has higher land occupation than agro-bioenergy, LCIA indicator results are of similar magnitude or even lower for forest bioenergy. Previous literature indicates that environmental impacts of land use are significant, but it remains questionable if these are captured with satisfactory reliability with the applied LCA methodology, especially for forest biomass. Short and long time perspectives of land use impacts should be studied in LCA with characterisation factors for all relevant timeframes, not only 500 years, with a forward-looking perspective. Characterisation factors need to be modelled further for different (forest) land management intensities and for peat excavation.

AB  - Wood products are considered to contribute to the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. A critical gap in the life cycle of wood products is to transfer the raw timber from the forest to the processing wood industry and, thus, the primary wood products. Therefore, often rough estimates are used for this step to obtain total forestry carbon balances. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the fate of timber harvested in Thuringian state forests (central Germany), representing a large, intensively managed forested region, and (2) to quantify carbon stocks and the lifetime of primary wood products made from this timber. The analyses were based on the amount and assortments of actually sold timber, and production parameters of the companies that bought and processed this timber. In addition, for coniferous stands of a selected Thuringian forest district, we calculated potential effects of management, as expressed by different thinning regimes on wood products and their lifetimes. Total annual timber sale of soft- and hardwoods from Thuringian state forests (195,000 ha) increased from about 136,893 t C (similar to 0.7 t C ha(-1) year(-1)) in 1996 to 280,194 t C (similar to 1.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1)) in 2005. About 47% of annual total timber harvest went into short-lived wood products with a mean residence time (MRT) < 25 years. Thirty-one per cent of the total harvest went into wood products with an MRT of 25-43 years, and only 22% was used as construction wood and glued wood, products with the longest MRT (50 years). The average MRT of carbon in harvested wood products was 20 years. Thinning from above throughout the rotation of spruce forests would lead to an average MRT in harvested wood products of about 23 years, thinning from below of about 18 years. A comparison of our calculations with estimates that resulted from the products module of the CO2FIX model (Nabuurs et al. 2001) demonstrates the influence of regional differences in forest management and wood processing industry on the lifetime of harvested wood products. To our knowledge, the present study provides for the first time real carbon inputs of a defined forest management unit to the wood product sector by linking data on raw timber production, timber sales and wood processing. With this new approach and using this data, it should be possible to substantially improve the net-carbon balance of the entire forestry sector.

AB  - We studied the biomass production of moss species typical of pine-dominated drained peatland forests to evaluate their potential role in the carbon cycle of such sites. The study was carried out at two sites in Lakkasuo, central Finland. Prior to drainage, the sites had been mesotrophic and ombrotrophic. Shoots of Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. russowii were marked in the autumn of 2004 and 2005, incorporated back in the original patches, recovered one year later, and measured for height growth, biomass, and biomass production. Biomass production varied from 16 to 388 g dry mass m(-2) yr(-1). Both height growth and biomass production were higher at the mesotrophic site, while biomass estimates did not show distinct difference between sites. Variation in production within each dominant species was considerable. A simulation with our production values and published estimates of decomposition rates showed that these species have the potential to contribute significantly to soil carbon storage in drained peatlands.

AB  - Questions: Have the natural plant communities of two mined bogs experienced changes in composition and richness over a three-decade period, and are these changes associated with anthropogenic disturbances?
   Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: We monitored three decades of floristic changes in two disturbed bogs by revisiting 57 plots in 1998, which were previously sampled in 1965 and 1966. Changes in species richness and composition were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, principal component analysis and partial redundancy analyses (pRDA). We also used pRDA and an indicator species analysis to determine which species had undergone the greatest changes over time. Variation partitioning was used to evaluate the relative influence of human disturbance in compositional change.
   Results: The main changes in the vegetation of the two bogs were 1) a decrease of overall species diversity, 2) an increase in the percent cover of trees and of species tolerant of shade or drought, and 3) a decrease in the cover of heliophilous species. Picea mariana, Sphagnum fuscum and Pleurozium schreberi increased in percent cover while Chamaedaphne calyculata and Sphagnum rubellum decreased in percent cover. Variation partitioning suggested that human activities had a significant impact on vegetation composition.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that substantial changes occurred in the vegetation of the natural fragments of these severely disturbed bogs. Although human activities were partially responsible for the changes, our study suggested that the drying of the peat surface due to drought during the 1960s and 1980s may have contributed to the vegetation changes.

AB  - Effects of forest management and soil acidity on herb layer vegetation were studied after 10 years on 190 permanent plots in south Swedish beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) forests. Species richness generally increased with management intensity, mainly due to establishment of ruderal species from the seed bank. Species richness of the typical forest flora was unaffected by management. Moderate management of oak stands favoured several species which are commonly found in semi-natural pastures. Classification and ordination of the data showed that the main floristic gradient within Swedish beech and oak forest vegetation is related to soil acidity. Species richness of the typical forest flora was strongly positively correlated with soil pH in beech forests, but this correlation was weaker in oak forests. The number of herbaceous plants with a broader habitat range increased with pH only in the oak forest plots. Long term changes in the forest environment, which may affect the vegetation, are the decline of grazing 150-50 years ago and soil acidification mainly caused by atmospheric pollutants during the last 50 years. In the one-decade perspective of this study, however, we did not find a general vend towards a more acid-tolerant flora. Neither could we find a general decrease of pasture species in currently ungrazed oak stands. The results indicate that most typical forest plants are well adapted to and partly depend on occurrence of canopy gaps and soil disturbance. If canopy thinning is followed by periods of canopy closure the characteristic shade tolerant flora of Swedish beech and oak forests may be able to persist as long as soil chemical limits of existence are not exceeded.

AB  - Planted monocultures of even-aged coniferous tree species are abundant worldwide but increasingly damaged by biotic and abiotic stressors and disturbances. In Central Europe, a fundamental goal of ecologically oriented forest management is thus the conversion of pure and often even-aged coniferous stands into structurally more diverse and mixed broad-leaved forests. This conversion is often achieved by single-tree selection resulting in small canopy openings that promote artificial or natural regeneration. Consequently, forest conversion aims at altering stand structure and tree communities. In order to describe the status quo of forest conversion and derive implications for forest management, we investigated changes of tree composition and forest structure in the Bavarian Spessart mountains in southwest Germany. We conducted a resurvey of 108 semi-permanent plots in four different coniferous stand types of Norway spruce, Scots pine, Douglas fir, and European larch about 30 years after the initial survey. We found significant differences in the stratification and cover of respective forest layers between the two sampling periods that indicated an increase in stand structural heterogeneity. While species richness of the overstorey remained constant, species richness and diversity of the shrub and lower canopy layer increased significantly. Regenerating "winner" species included late-successional broad-leaved (e.g., European beech, sessile oak), pioneer broad-leaved (e.g., silver birch, rowan) and shade-tolerant coniferous (e.g., silver fir, Douglas fir) species. Although Norway spruce was significantly reduced in the overstorey, it regenerated in parts extensively in the understorey. We conclude that the forest conversion in the Spessart mountains was overall successful in terms of diversifying forest structure and tree species. Its effects are, though, still emerging and the stands are in a transitional phase. Besides the preferred natural regeneration of target tree species, forest management may consider active measures to guide the facilitated diverse tree community of previously pure and even-aged coniferous stands towards stand maturity.

AB  - Knowledge of sea spider (Pycnogonida, Arthropoda) distribution and habitat preferences within Norwegian waters is scarce. During the MAREANO programme from 2007 to 2009, 3909 pycnogonid specimens representing 21 species and nine genera were collected. Pycnogonida were found at a total of 60 stations from 78 to 2609 m depth using van Veen grab, RP-sledge and beam trawl. Nymphon, the dominant genus, constituted 52% of the specimens sampled. Cilunculus battenae was recorded for the first time within Norwegian waters, and Pseudopallene longicollis was recorded for the first time in Norwegian Arctic waters (72 degrees 16N, 14 degrees 36E at 0.64 degrees C). New records of Pseudopallene brevicollis, Boreonymphon robustum and B. ossiansarsi are reported. Boreonymphon abyssorum and Nymphon macronyx showed the widest depth ranges (100-2000 m depth). The known northern distribution of Callipallene producta was extended to 71 degrees 42N, 15 degrees 25E, Northern Norway. Two-thirds of the species found had their centre of distribution below 500 m and a species diversity maximum was found at 800-900 m. Four main species groups with different depth distributions were identified by cluster analysis: (1) shallow, above transition zone; (2) lower part of transition zone (transition zone is cold Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediary Water (0.5 to -0.5 degrees C) at 600 to 900 m depth); (3) lower transition zone, wide-ranging; and (4) mainly below 1000 m depth. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis supported the same pattern of clustering.

AB  - Landscape context is known to affect species diversity patterns and can even influence the effectiveness of local conservation management in agricultural landscapes. For other land uses, like forestry, landscape effects are poorly known. We aimed to determine whether landscape composition modifies the response of saproxylic beetle species to local habitat and conservation management, with focus on dead wood and prescribed fire, in managed boreal forest landscapes. We surveyed beetles on 32 clearcuts in central Sweden. We measured local (fire, dead wood, flower resources, patch size) and landscape factors (fire, dead wood within 1-2 km radius), and analysed interactions between these in mixed models. The response was species richness of beetles with different habitat specialization - conifer specialists, deciduous specialists, flower visitor and pyrophilous species, and abundance of a red-listed species, Tragosoma depsarium. Local and landscape factors, as well as interactions between them, affected species richness patterns. Prescribed fire and amount of dead wood, both on local and landscape scale, affected species richness and composition of several groups. There were interactions between local and landscape factors in five models out of six. Locally, we observed a positive response to flower richness for several groups, while the response to prescribed fire and dead wood amounts typically was affected by landscape factors. The results suggest that effectiveness of local conservation management is affected by landscape properties; the positive effects of local dead wood amounts and burning occurred on clearcuts in landscapes with large amounts of dead wood, but not in landscapes with small amounts of dead wood.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can negatively impact the persistence of dispersal-limited lichen species with narrow niches. Rapid change in microclimate due to canopy dieback exposes species to additional stressors that may limit their capacity to survive and colonize. We studied the importance of old trees as micro-refuges and microclimate stability in maintaining lichen survival and diversity. The study was situated in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests of the Gorgany Mountains of the Ukrainian Carpathian mountain belt. Lichens were collected on 13 circular study plots (1000 m(2)). Dendrochronological methods were used to reconstruct age structure and maximum disturbance event history. A linear mixed effects model and general additive models were used to explain patterns and variability of lichens based on stand age and disturbance history for each plot. Tree age was the strongest variable influencing lichen diversity and composition. Recent (< 80 years ago) severely disturbed plots were colonized only by the most common species, however, old trees (> 200 years old) that survived the disturbances served as microrefuges for the habitat-specialized and/or dispersal limited species, thus epiphytic lichen biodiversity was markedly higher on those plots in comparison to plots without any old trees. Most species were able to survive microclimatic change after disturbances, or recolonize disturbed patches from surrounding old-growth forests. We concluded that the survival of old trees after disturbances could maintain and/or recover large portions of epiphytic lichen biodiversity even in altered microclimates.

AB  - Culicid larvae were collected in snow-melt pools during the first half of June from 1975-1977 and 1995-1996 in the Abisko Valley, Tome Lapmark, northern Sweden. Twelve species were collected from 102 pools and 81 localities with 7,914 specimens (elevations from 300 to 650 in a.s.l.). Fourteen species are now known from the area. Ten types of larval habitats were classified and ten species were statistically analyzed on pooled values over all years for abundance, coexistence, and diversity. The greatest abundance of individuals had pools with Carex spp. on the bottom. Most widespread and abundant were Oc. hexodontus (Dyar), Oc. communis (DeGeer), Oc. pullatus (Coquillett), and Oc. punctor (Kirby). The two circumpolar, arctic species, Oc. nigripes (Zetterstedt) and Oc. impiger (Walker), were mainly confined to elevations above 400 m a.s.l. In such marginal habitats as these pools, exposed to variable abitotic conditions, the phenology of species was rather constant. Species diversity varied somewhat between habitats. Oc. hexodontus, Oc. communis, and Oc. pullatus most often occupied pools as single species. Oc. communis and Oc. hexodontus had the highest values for coexistence and also occurred with Oc. punctor. The habitats that were richest in species were those without vegetation or with detritus on the bottom and surrounded by Empetrum nigrum and Betula nana. These habitats contained between eight and ten species. Species abundance and coexistence over the years showed no stable species patterns for the habitat types in the area.

AB  - Addressing urban challenges with nature-based approaches can improve and protect ecosystem services. Yet, urban planning has not efficiently integrated such approaches to manage land use. This paper examines interactions between human and natural systems that result in ecosystem services and changes in land use and land cover in urban areas. It develops a social-ecological model for land use and land cover change, and for ecosystems services that integrates nature-based solutions in urban planning. The model treats spatial variations in ecosystems services as both drivers and consequences of human decision-making in choosing commercial and residential locations that drive land use and land cover change. We tested the social-ecological model in Stockholm County, Sweden, on a 30 x 30 m grid. Results show that accessibility in ecosystem services drives urban residential and commercial development, characterized by non-linearity. Areas around existing urban centers show high accessibility in ecosystem services and high development probabilities, whereas smaller population centers in large areas enjoy high accessibility to ecosystem services and low urban development probabilities. Model results suggest place-specific nature-based strategies for addressing the heterogeneous spatial relationships between ecosystem services and urban development. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - At the end of October 2018, a storm of unprecedented strength severely damaged the forests of the eastern sector of the Italian Alps. The affected forest area covers 42,500 ha. The president of one of the damaged regions asked for help from the University of Padua. After eight months of discussion, the authors of this article wrote a consensus text. The sometimes asper debate brought to light some crucial aspects: 1) even experienced specialists may have various opinions based on scientific knowledge that lead to conflicting proposals for action. For some of them there is evidence that to restore a destroyed natural environment it is more judicious to do nothing; 2) the soil corresponds to a living structure and every ecosystem's management should be based on it; 3) faced with a catastrophe, people and politicians find themselves unarmed, also because they rarely have the scientific background to understand natural processes. Yet politicians are the only persons who make the key decisions that drive the economy in play and therefore determine the near future of our planet. This article is an attempt to respond directly to a governor with a degree in animal production science, who formally and prudently asked a university department called "Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry" for help before taking decisions; 4) the authors also propose an artistic interpretation of facts (uncontrolled storm) and conclusions (listen to the soil). Briefly, the authors identify the soil as an indispensable source for the renewal of the destroyed forest, give indications on how to prepare a map of the soils of the damaged region, and suggest to anchor on this soil map a series of silvicultural and soil management actions that will promote the soil conservation and the faster recovery of the natural dynamic stability and resilience.

AB  - Recent studies on butterflies emphasize habitat characteristics together with metapopulation parameters (patch area and isolation) giving a more thorough understanding of processes influencing population persistence and patch occupancy, than either of them alone. We studied a coastal and an archipelago population of the Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo) in SW Finland. Larvae were surveyed for four years in both populations. Counting larvae on three consecutive days and temporarily removing them tested the survey accuracy. The removals showed four times higher larval abundance in the archipelago than on the coast. Survey methods were reliable, provided that empty patch status was not based on single visits only, if larval abundance was low. On the coast, large patches, and patches with high host-plant abundance were often occupied. In the archipelago, patches rich in host-plant were often occupied whereas patch area did not affect patch occupancy. In both populations, the probability of patches being occupied for three consecutive years increased with increasing host-plant abundance and patch area. Conservation of P. apollo depends on securing host-plant abundance on large enough patches in both study systems. In these systems, even crude habitat measures prove useful for understanding ecological processes behind observed patterns.

AB  - Conservation strategies increasingly refer to indicators derived from large biological data. However, such data are often unique with respect to scale and species groups considered. To compare richness patterns emerging from different inventories, we analysed forest species richness at both the landscape and the community scales in Switzerland. Numbers of forest species were displayed using nationwide distributional species data and referring to three different definitions of forest species. The best regression models on a level of four predictor variables ranged between adj. R2=0.50 and 0.66 and revealed environmental heterogeneity/energy, substrate (rocky outcrops) and precipitation as best explanatory variables of forest species richness at the landscape scale. A systematic sample of community data (n=729; 30m2, 200m2, 500m2) was examined with respect to nationwide community diversity and plot species richness. More than 50% of all plots were assigned to beech forests (Eu-Fagion, Cephalanthero-Fagion, Luzulo-Fagion and Abieti-Fagion), 14% to Norway spruce forests (Vaccinio-Piceion) and 13% to silver fir forests (Piceo-Abietion). Explanatory variables were derived from averaged indicator values per plot, and from biophysical and disturbance factors. The best models for plot species richness using four predictor variables ranged between adj. R2=0.31 and 0.34. Light (averaged L-indicator, tree canopy) and substrate (averaged R-indicator and pH) had the highest explanatory power at all community scales. By contrast, the influence of disturbance variables was very small, as only a small portion of plots were affected by this factor. The effects of disturbances caused by extreme events or by management would reduce the tree canopies and lead to an increase in plant species richness at the community scale. Nevertheless, such community scale processes will not change the species richness at the landscape scale. Instead, the variety of different results derived from different biological data confirms the diversity of aspects to consider. Therefore, conservation strategies should refer to value systems.

AB  - The number of protected areas (PAs) has steadily increased in the past 20 years, but their effectiveness to meet conservation targets is consistently questioned. Most conservation impact evaluations of protected areas assume that formal designations, like that of IUCN categories, reflect site-specific conservation rules, but this is not always true. In this paper we illustrate how conservation rules could be empirically assessed by use of content analysis combined with optimal scaling. This flexible methodology allows us to quantitatively assess strictness levels for use in conservation impact evaluations. The strictness measures could also indicate whether conservation rules are consistently applied in the different IUCN categories thereby providing guidance for future assignment of PAs to the IUCN protected area management categories. We illustrate how policy indicators based on conservation rules could be developed in two contrasting mountain protected area networks in Norway and in British Columbia (BC), including a total of 48 PAs in Norway and 51 in BC. Conservation rules for recreational use, motorized access and resource use were quantitatively assessed, thus providing a measure of how strictly PAs regulate the different human activities. Our results show that the main differences in strictness are between the two countries, followed by the contrast between national parks and provincial parks in BC. Overall, Norway has a more liberal conservation policy than BC and older national parks in BC have a much stricter conservation policy than most of the other PAs in this study. Overarching conservation objectives did not reflect the level of strictness (the conservation rules) that guide the daily management of individual PAs. This applies to both countries. We recommend to empirically investigate site-specific conservation rules to include de facto management of human activities in conservation policy impact evaltiations. The methodology is also useful for monitoring downgrading of the protected area status, which is a result of authorizing human activities that are not consistent with conservation objectives.

AB  - Understanding the distribution of biodiversity across forest landscapes is a key issue for the spatial planning of conservation management. Obtaining such spatial perspective is challenging because a large part of biodiversity remains hidden to the conventional survey approaches. High-productivity forests are probably the hotspots of hidden biodiversity and, at the same time, under severe timber harvesting pressure. We used DNAmetabarcoding approach to assess habitat quality of successional high productivity forests for wood-inhabiting fungi, focusing on fungal diversity that remains hidden in fruit-body surveys. We sampled a fixed amount of coarse fallen Norway spruce trunks in 40 naturally developing stands ranging from 44 to 140 years of age in hemi-boreal Estonia. We found three main habitat quality patterns. The total number of fungal OTUs in older (>80 years) stands exceeded that in younger stands due to the accumulation of rare fungi. The proportion of trunks hosting highest number of OTUs and trunk-scale richness of rare fungi were greatest in stands surrounded by extensive forest area. The average number of red-listed species per trunk increased mainly along with the volume of fallen dead wood; large volumes provided quality habitats already before the stands had reached 80 years of age. These results support the view that both substrate amount in the forest stand and habitat connectivity on a landscape scale support fungal diversity in dead wood. Earlier studies on wood-inhabiting fungi have reached similar conclusions based on observations of fungal fruit-bodies. Thus, the overall principle of focusing conservation efforts to remaining high quality habitats and landscapes extends to the fungi hidden to the conventional survey methods.

AB  - Butterfly communities were studied along field boundaries in agricultural habitats in Finnish and Russian Karelia. A total of 34 sites represented typical arable land in both countries, i.e. modem cereal and forage cultivation in Finland (n = 17) and old fashioned hay cultivation in Russia (n = 17). Transect count data obtained over three years (1997-1999) consisted of 55 species and 11759 individuals: 53 species and 5382 individuals in Finland, and 49 species and 6377 individuals in Russia. Despite various differences in the long-term exploitation of arable land, the species composition and the total abundance of butterflies were rather similar in both countries, but the species richness and diversity were higher in Finland. The different structure of agricultural landscapes and differences between the two countries as regards the distribution of field vegetation and cultivation practices in the studied habitats were regarded as the main factors responsible for the result being contradictory to the authors' expectations.

AB  - Altitudinal treelines are typically temperature limited such that increasing temperatures linked to global climate change are causing upslope shifts of treelines worldwide. While such elevational increases are readily predicted based on shifting isotherms, at the regional level the realized response is often much more complex, with topography and local environmental conditions playing an important modifying role. Here, we used repeated aerial photographs in combination with forest inventory data to investigate changes in treeline position in the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan over the last 60years. A highly spatially variable upslope advance of treeline was identified in which topography is a major driver of both treeline form and advance. The changes in treeline position that we observed occurred alongside substantial increases in forest density, and lead to a large increase in overall forest area. These changes will have a significant impact on carbon stocking in the high altitude zone, while the concomitant decrease in alpine grassland area is likely to have negative implications for alpine species. The complex and spatially variable changes that we report highlight the necessity for considering local factors such as topography when attempting to predict species distributional responses to warming climate.

AB  - Patterns of carbon (C) allocation across different stages of stand development in Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis plantations are not well understood. In this study, we examined biomass and mineral soil C content in five development stages (1, 2, 3, 4-5, and 6-8 years old) of a Eucalyptus stand in southern China. The tree biomass C pool increased with stand age and showed a high annual rate of accumulation. Stems accounted for the highest proportion of biomass C sequestered. The C pool in mineral soil increased initially after afforestation and then declined gradually, with C density decreasing with soil depth. The upper 50 cm of soil contained the majority (57%-68%) of sequestered C. The other biomass components (shrubs, herbaceous plants, litter, and fine roots) accounted for <5% of the total ecosystem C pool. Total C pools in the Eucalyptus plantation ecosystem were 112.9, 172.5, 203.8, 161.1, and 162.7 Mg ha(-1) in the five developmental stages, respectively, with most of the C sequestered below ground. We conclude that Eucalyptus plantations have considerable biomass C sequestration potential during stand development.

AB  - Urban ecosystem accounting can provide the structure for systematically integrating the value of urban green spaces into management and decision making to support urban resilience and sustainability. However, there are very few instructive examples of urban ecosystem accounting, particularly those created collaboratively with a municipality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop co-created urban ecosystem accounts using Tampere, Finland, as a case study. By discussing concrete political and planning-related needs, priorities, and data availability, this study identified urban flooding and the role of green spaces in alleviating this challenge as critical issues. An ecosystem extent account was compiled for accounting years 2012 and 2018 to quantify changes in the extent of ecosystem types. Additionally, an ecosystem service account (physical and monetary), for runoff retention, was compiled for the same years. The runoff retention service was quantified using the InVEST Urban Flood Risk Mitigation model, considering two precipitation events representative of rainstorms that trigger urban flooding. The runoff retention service was translated into service providing areas, which were used in conjunction with service demanding areas to estimate the physical terms of actual flows of retention service for accounting. The monetary value of the service was estimated using the avoided damage cost method. Between 2012 and 2018, the value of runoff mitigation service provided by green spaces increased by 7 % under the 24 mm scenario and by more than 40 % under the 50 mm scenario. The accounts showed concretely how important urban green spaces are in the City of Tampere, and provide an argument to preserve and even increase them in the urban structure. Our experiential ecosystem accounts for urban runoff retention service by green spaces also offer insights to other municipalities, encouraging them to take steps forward in ecosystem accounting.

AB  - Many frameworks, theories and tools exist to help operationalize and comprehend the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability. However, knowledge about how the concepts are perceived at a local level is scarce. The objective of this paper is therefore to gain such insight and, through this, to contribute to the understanding of local sustainability dynamics. A study of perceptions of sustainability was carried out in Geirangerfjord, a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Natural World Heritage Site in Western Norway. Using semi-structured interviews, stakeholders were asked about their perceptions of what sustainable development in Geirangerfjord entails. Several methods of analysis were used, namely, theme analysis, emergent pattern analysis and group comparisons. Furthermore, an approach we call the "What Is Not There (WINT) analysis" was developed to identify themes that are part of the sustainability discourse, but that were not mentioned by stakeholders. Among the results of the analysis are that social dimensions of sustainability dominated the perceptions of stakeholders. Stakeholder perceptions are furthermore context-dependent and are formed by sustainability issues that are close to people's lives. The study also indicates that place of residence is a strong determinant of perceptions. In this way, the article adds to the existing literature on perceptions of sustainability.

AB  - Graph-theoretic connectivity analyses have received much attention in connectivity evaluation during the last few years. Here, we explore the underlying conceptual differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures. Based on connectivity analyses from three reserve networks in forested landscapes in Central Finland, we illustrate how these conceptual differences cause inconsistent connectivity evaluations at both the landscape and patch level. Our results also illustrate how the characteristics of the networks (patch density) may affect the performance of the different measures. Many of the connectivity measures react to changes in habitat connectivity in an ecologically undesirable manner. Patch prioritisations based on a node removal analysis were sensitive to the connectivity measure they were based on. The patch prioritisations derived from different measures showed a disparity in terms of how much weight they put on patch size versus patch location and how they value patch location. Although graphs operate at the interface of structure and function, there is still much to do for incorporating the inferred ecological process into graph structures and analyses. If graph analyses are going to be used for real-world management and conservation purposes, a more thorough understanding of the caveats and justifications of the graph-theoretic connectivity measures will be needed.

AB  - Biochar is charcoal produced from feedstock under pyrolysis. It has gained interests among researchers in recent years because of its agronomic and environmental benefits. It is considered to increase soil fertility and crop productivity, and biochar might play an important role as a climate mitigation tool that is able to capture carbon in the soil.
   However, although research has focused on the chemical, biological, and technical aspects of biochar, we seem to be far away from the implementation of a functioning biochar system. One key aspect needed for the actual use of biochar technologies is increased awareness and emphasis on the social and organizational aspects of its implementation. As there are no functional markets for the services and products needed to 'produce' a biochar system, political and market devices are needed. This paper contributes to this debate by introducing a socio-technical framework that investigates the implementation of different biochar technologies in Norway. Based on this socio-technical system framework, we discuss necessary components of a sustainable biochar socio-technical system, and we outline variations of this system based on different levels of biochar production scaling.

AB  - Salmon lice from fish farms in open net pens pose a threat to the survival of wild salmon post-smolts migrating through areas with high farm and lice densities. Reliable estimation of this mortality is fundamental for the sustainable management of aquaculture in such areas but is challenged by considerable uncertainty about several of the processes that link reported lice numbers in fish farms to post-smolt mortality. Utilising recent access to lice data from post-smolt trawling, we revised a virtual post-smolt model that estimates salmon lice-induced mortality of seaward-migrating wild salmon post-smolts. We also assessed the sensitivity of model results to model assumptions that differ among the virtual post-smolt models currently being used as management support in Norway. The spatiotemporal variation in infestation pressure along the entire Norwegian coast was calculated based on monitoring data for salmon lice, temperature and fish abundance in all Norwegian salmonid farm locations. The revised model integrates lice data from sentinel cage experiments and post-smolt trawling to quantify the spatiotemporal variation in infestation rate of wild post-smolts from the spatiotemporal infestation pressure, while also estimating the effect of calibration data type on infestation rate. Results show 10 times higher infestation rate in trawl-caught post-smolts than in post-smolts from sentinel cage experiments. Mortality estimates calibrated to trawl data are more sensitive to assumptions about possible density dependence in lice infestation rate than to assumptions about migration speed. These findings contribute to explaining why different virtual post-smolt models provide different estimates of salmon lice-induced mortality.

AB  - The construction industry is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which has a negative environmental impact. Several studies have highlighted the possibility of using timber to reduce the environmental impact of construction. Most of these studies have focused on residential buildings, but little attention has been devoted to industrial buildings. In this paper, an attempt is made to compare the environmental impact of using timber, steel, and reinforced concrete in industrial buildings using life cycle assessment. The system boundary was set to cradle-to-gate with transportation to construction site due to the limitation of data, and only the quantities of the main structural system are considered. Portal frames with variable spans were designed using the three materials to meet similar load carrying capacity. Reinforced concrete was used in the foundation of all frames. The results of the comparative study show that timber has, by a good margin, better environmental impact than reinforced concrete and steel, due to the carbon stored in the wood. The results also show that reinforced concrete and steel alternatives have similar environmental impacts. The findings of this study agree with the findings of other studies on residential buildings.

AB  - Steadily increasing damage to Norway spruce forests in Europe has caused researchers and managers to consider whether these forests can be converted to more stable ecosystems. In a central European mountain region, we investigated whether management systems (MSs) specified by regional stakeholders provide sound alternatives to the currently applied management. We used the forest model Sibyla to explore whether the tested MSs differ in their sensitivity to climate change in terms of altered biomass production, stand structure, forest damage, and financial outcome. The tested MSs were no-management (NM), currently applied management (BAU), and management based on the preferences of forest managers (FM) or on the preferences of other stakeholders (OSH). With NM, spruce remained dominant during the simulation period 2010-2100, and the rate of damage significantly increased. Spruce also remained dominant with FM, while the abundance of non-spruce species significantly increased with BAU and OSH. The rate of salvage logging converged at 50% of the total harvest for all MSs up to 2050. Climate change reduced biomass production (-15%) with all MSs but had a negligible effect on biodiversity indicators. The average initial value of the simulated stands was 20,000 a,notsign ha(-1) and the nominal value in 2100 was between 1900 and 10,900 a,notsign ha(-1). The Net Present Value calculated with the 2% interest rate was negative during the whole simulation period (-5600 to -18,500 a,notsign ha(-1) in 2100). Effect of climate change on all financial indicators was negative. Our findings indicate that secondary spruce forests are highly vulnerable and that the systems proposed by both forest managers and other regional stakeholders failed to significantly reduce forest damage and stabilize forest production.

AB  - Planting new forests has received scientific and political attention as a measure to mitigate climate change. Large, new forests have been planted in places like China and Ethiopia and, over time, a billion hectares could become available globally for planting new forests. Sustainable management of forests, which are available to wood production, has received less attention despite these forests covering at least two billion hectares globally. Better management of existing forests would improve forest growth and help mitigate climate change by increasing the forest carbon (C) stock, by storing C in forest products, and by generating wood-based materials substituting fossil C based materials or other CO2-emission-intensive materials. Some published research assumes a trade-off between the timber harvested from existing forests and the stock of C in those forest ecosystems, asserting that both cannot increase simultaneously. We tested this assumption using the uniquely detailed forest inventory data available from Finland, Norway and Sweden, hereafter denoted northern Europe. We focused on the period 1960 - 2017, that saw little change in the total area covered by forests in northern Europe. At the start of the period, rotational forestry practices began to diffuse, eventually replacing selective felling management systems as the most common management practice. Looking at data over the period we find that despite significant increases in timber and pulp wood harvests, the growth of the forest C stock accelerated. Over the study period, the C stock of the forest ecosystems in northern Europe increased by nearly 70%, while annual timber harvests increased at the about 40% over the same period. This increase in the forest C stock was close to on par with the CO2-emissions from the region (other greenhouse gases not included). Our results suggest that the important effects of management on forest growth allows the forest C stock and timber harvests to increase simultaneously. The development in northern Europe raises the question of how better forest management can improve forest growth elsewhere around the globe while at the same time protecting biodiversity and preserving landscapes.

AB  - This article synthesizes and reviews the available information on the effects of forestry practices on the occurrence of biotic and abiotic hazards, as well as on stand susceptibility to these damaging agents, concentrating on mammal herbivores, pest insects, pathogenic fungi, wind and fire.
   The management operations examined are site selection, site preparation, stand composition, regeneration method, cleaning and weed control, thinning and pruning, and harvesting. For each of these operations we have examined how they influence the occurrence of biotic and abiotic damaging agents, the susceptibility of European forests, and describe the ecological processes that may explain these influences.
   Overall, we find that the silvicultural operations that have the largest influence on both biotic and abiotic risks to European forest stands are closely related to species composition and the structure of the overstorey. Four main processes that drive the causal relationships between stand management and susceptibility have been identified: effect on local microclimate, provision of fuel and resources to biotic and abiotic hazards, enhancement of biological control by natural enemies and changes in individual tree physiology and development.
   The review demonstrates an opportunity to develop silvicultural methods that achieve forest management objectives at the same time as minimising biotic and abiotic risks.

AB  - We tested whether the recovery of riparian vegetation along rapids that have been restored after channelisation for timber floating can be predicted based on floristic and geomorphic characteristics of surrounding landscape units. Our study was located along tributary stream networks, naturally fragmented in rapids, slow-flowing reaches, and lakes (i.e. process domains), in the Vindel River catchment in northern Sweden.
   We tested whether landscape characteristics, specifically to what extent the geomorphology (affecting local abiotic conditions), species richness, and species composition (representing the species pool for recolonisation), as well as the proximity to various upstream process domains (determining the dispersal potential), can predict post-restoration recovery of riparian vegetation.
   Our results indicate that post-restoration recovery of riparian vegetation richness or composition is not strongly related to landscape-scale species pools in these streams. The restored rapids were most similar to upstream rapids, geomorphically and floristically, including plant traits. Species richness of adjacent landscape units (upstream process domains or lateral upland zone) did not correlate with that of restored rapids, and proximity of upstream rapids or other process domains was only weakly influential, thus diminishing support for the hypothesis that hydrochory or other means of propagule dispersal plays a strong role in riparian vegetation community organisation after restoration in this fragmented stream network.
   We conclude that, in these naturally fragmented stream systems with three discrete process domains (rapids, slow-flowing reaches and lakes), hydrochory is probably not the main predictor for short-term riparian vegetation recovery. Therefore, other factors than landscape context can serve in prioritising restoration and, in these systems, local factors are likely to outweigh landscape connectivity in the recovery of riparian vegetation.

AB  - Transportation infrastructure has a wide range of effects on ecological processes, which result in both positive and negative impacts for biodiversity. However, the treatment of biodiversity in planning and environmental assessment have been criticized, especially regarding habitat loss and fragmentation effects, the low use of quantitative methods and that of assessments being descriptive rather than analytical and predictive. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of the Swedish road network by spatial modelling of road effects, to explore potential impacts of fragmentation and disturbance effects of roads on habitat networks for selected ecological profiles, and to discuss the utility of applying quantitative methods for environmental assessment purposes. Habitat and landcover data was used for creating habitat networks for six ecological profiles. Fragmentation and disturbance effects were modelled in GIS and FRAGSTATS was used to quantify ecologically important landscape metrics on habitat amount and connectivity. The results showed that natural grasslands and southern broadleaved forest were substantially more exposed to road effects in Sweden, compared to old coniferous and trivial broadleaved forest. Furthermore, habitat loss was a main consequence of road effects, and forest species with high area demands were most prone to be adversely impacted. Suggestions on method development in order to increase the quality of the analysis methods for environmental assessment are discussed. The potential is seen as high for use of quantitative ecological methods to generate baseline environmental information as well as coarse predictions on likely consequences of development options, useful for environmental assessment.

AB  - Due to the impacts of hydrological and ecological processes on water quality, discharges from upstream catchments have induced significant pollution to the recipients. This study aims to investigate the possible pollution sources from catchments with different types of land use and landscape patterns and develop the relationships between water quality and the catchment hydro-geological and environmental variables. Data from 10 monitoring sites in Trondheim formulated the basis of the case study. Thermotolerant Coliform Bacteria (TCB) and Total Phosphorus (TP) were applied as main indicators to represent the water quality in the recipient rivers, streams and in Trondheim Fjord. Based on the GIS-oriented spatial analysis, 15 hydro-geographical and landscape parameters were selected as explanatory variables. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were developed at catchment and river reach scales to study correlations between the explanatory variables and the response variables, TCB and TP, in rain and snow seasons. The study showed that the spatial landscape patterns resulted in differences in the concentrations of TCB and TP in the recipients. The agricultural land was shown to be the main pollution source, leading to a higher concentration of TP in streams. Buildings, roads, and other impervious areas have induced an increase in both TCB and TP. In contrast, the forest areas, lakes, river density and steep river slopes were shown to have capacity to filter incoming P-rich runoff, thus prevent pollutant conveyance and accumulation in recipients.

AB  - The Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic has been subjected to large-scale cultural, economic and ecological changes, especially during the last three decades. Environmental threats originate from both basin-wide sources, affecting the whole Baltic Sea, and from local sources, such as nutrient loading from nearby river outflows, intense agriculture, fish farming, ships' traffic, boating, and man's physical impacts on the landscape and seascape. Both the Aland archipelago and the Archipelago Sea have been listed as hot-spots by HELCOM, Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, eutrophication being the main threat to the aquatic environment. In this study we review how biological communities have reacted to an increase in man-induced multisource stresses. Changes in plankton, benthic animals, macroalgal assemblages and fish communities have been documented in most parts of the Baltic Sea since the 1970s. What remains to be understood is the importance of these structural changes for the functioning of the Archipelago Sea ecosystem under various levels of human impact.

AB  - Organic farming systems have been proposed to support higher biodiversity than conventional ones, and higher diversity might make ecosystems more resilient against environmental change. We investigated how dung beetle communities and associated ecological functions (dung removal) vary at two hierarchical levels among Swedish dairy farms: between farming systems (organic vs. conventional) and among farms within farming systems. At the level of farming systems, we detected no differences in dung beetle species richness, abundance or diversity. The total biomass of beetles was slightly higher on conventional farms than on organic ones, but this difference did not correspond to a difference in dung-system functioning. However, at the farm level, we found significant differences in species richness, abundance and total biomass, reflected in significantly different provisioning of ecological functions among farms. Our results identify the importance of farm-specific variation in dung beetle assemblages for ecosystem functioning. Local decisions made by farmers may thereby override general differences among farming systems. Thus, policies aimed at promoting fine-scale management actions are an important supplement to general rules for certification under different farming systems. The current results are likely context-dependent, as based on efficient uptake and substantial environmental awareness among Swedish dairy farmers. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - Animal husbandry in Europe that sustained once wide-spread semi-natural grasslands has been replaced by maximum sustained yield agriculture and forestry. This transformation coincides with declining populations of species dependent on semi-natural grasslands. A key task is therefore to define benchmarks for landscape restoration in terms of well-planned functional habitat networks, i.e., green infrastructure. Using a representative example of the European landscape gradient between agricultural and forest landscapes in southern Sweden as a case study, we analyzed the historic range of variability of the total area, quality, and size of grassland patches, and compared this to the requirements of focal grassland species. Spatial data covering the past two centuries indicated a 75-80% loss of total grassland area. Three factors affected the functionality of grasslands as green infrastructure. First, during the period 1927-1976, the loss of all grassland areas with high nature values was 41-59%. Second, as a measure of alteration, the number of semi-natural grassland types declined from 5 to 1. Third, to address habitat fragmentation, an analysis of changes in grassland patch size showed that patches sufficiently large to support local populations of complete focal grasslands species assemblages declined by 89-100%. The cumulative effect of loss, alteration, and fragmentation over the past two centuries indicates that the functionality of semi-natural grasslands has declined by at least 98%. However, this estimate does not consider land use changes before 1800, reduced connectivity, and altered biotic and abiotic processes in both semi-natural grasslands and the surrounding matrix. We stress the need to define the historic range of variability as a benchmark in relation to species' requirements to maintain semi-natural grasslands as green infrastructure. Finally, integrated land management and governance that support multi-functionality of grasslands is needed.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services is entering the agenda of land-use planning and scientists optimistically expect it to inform planners and decision-makers about the benefits that ecosystems provide. While tools and methods have been developed for mapping and valuing ecosystem services, only little attention has been paid to the practical application of the approach or its institutional preconditions and implications. We empirically analysed two urban planning processes for building residential areas in the outskirts of growing population centres in Finland. Our analysis of documents and interviews with planners focused on the benefits provided by ecosystems as well as the associated rights and responsibilities. We found that the concept ecosystem service' was not used, yet various benefits were identified. The rights of different stakeholders to ecosystem services were not explicitly identified, but many ecosystem services were perceived as public goods and particularly access to recreation was highlighted as an important justification for green areas. The results show that while the ecosystem services approach introduces new insights to land-use planning, it is still not embedded in the current practices or institutions. Operationalizing ecosystem services requires institutional adaptation, case-specific tailoring of methods, and deliberation among practitioners and stakeholders.

AB  - Ecological restoration is poised to become an increasingly important component of landscape management in the coming years as countries work to halt the rate of biodiversity loss. The success of future restoration projects will depend equally on both achieving biological objectives and on producing conditions that meet public expectations. Yet we often know very little about either how the public perceives the purpose or goals of ecological restoration, or how restoration might fit into public expectations for landscape management. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian population (n = 4,077) to determine how familiar the Norwegian public is with ecological restoration, to explore their perceptions of restoration's purposes and goals, and to assess their preferences for types of common Norwegian landscapes. Survey participants generally had little familiarity with ecological restoration, yet they had a greater tendency to view restoration's purpose as enhancing naturalness than as providing benefits for humans. Public attitudes regarding landscape management were reasonably balanced between preserving cultural landscapes and promoting natural landscapes free from traces of human activity. While participants gave agricultural landscapes the highest scores for desirability, the survey did not reveal any conspicuous variation in landscape preferences among the Norwegian public. Policymakers, land managers, and ecological restoration practitioners should use insights from studies such as ours to help identify which future projects are most likely to enjoy widespread support, and to tailor their communication with stakeholders.

AB  - Aim The seaweed Fucus ceranoides is restricted to spatially discrete estuarine habitats and lacks planktonic dispersal phases; it is therefore expected to exhibit strong population differentiation. Its cold-temperate affinities and mtDNA variation imply that the northern part of the species range, where F. ceranoides is now ubiquitous, was recently colonized after the onset of the last deglaciation, potentially resulting in areas with greater genetic homogeneity. Here we examine the population structure of F. ceranoides to test these predictions, emphasizing the contrasting genetic signatures of limited dispersal in refugial versus recently colonized regions. Location North-eastern Atlantic estuaries from Portugal to Norway. Methods A total of 504 individuals from 21 estuarine sites spanning the entire range of F. ceranoides were sampled and genotyped for nine microsatellite loci. Population structure was inferred from several genotypic and allele-frequency analyses. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were used to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the species. Results Genetic diversity and regional population differentiation showed a consistent decline with increasing latitude. Southernmost populations harboured most of the endemic variation, whereas the northern populations (> 55 degrees N) were almost fixed for the same alleles across loci. In southern and central regions of its distribution, F. ceranoides showed striking population subdivision, with many of the sampled estuaries corresponding to coherent genetic units that were easily discriminated from one another with standard clustering methods. Main conclusions The geographical pattern of genetic diversity supports the long-term refugial status of Iberia and a post-glacial range expansion of F. ceranoides into previously glaciated latitudes. Despite the species capacity to colonize newly available habitats, the genetic structure of F. ceranoides outside the recently (re)colonized range reveals that gene flow between populations is extremely low. This study provides a remarkable example of how infrequent and spatially limited dispersal can have contrasting effects at the scales of meta-population (connectivity) versus range dynamics (habitat tracking), and of how dispersal restrictions can result in either genetic divergence or homogeneity depending on the maturity and demographic conditions of the populations.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands resulting from traditional land use practices (mowing and grazing) are severely endangered throughout Europe due to the intensification of agriculture. The ecological impact of mowing and grazing on grassland butterflies was studied in eight mown meadows and eight grazed pastures under traditional animal husbandry in NW Russia and adjacent Finland. Transect count data over 3 years (1997-1999) covered a total of 48 species and 5742 individuals. The butterfly fauna was rather similar under both management forms; species richness, diversity and total abundance did not differ significantly between meadows and pastures, yet meadows were preferred by more species. In both groups, the most abundant species were Aphantopus hyperantus, Pieris napi and Thymelicus lineola. Of 37 species observed as a minimum of five individuals, Polyommatus amandus, Ochlodes sylvanus and A. hyperantus showed a significant preference for mowing management. According to the ordination, butterfly communities were affected more by the origin and age of the grassland than the present management method. Landscape factors (meadow or pasture surrounded by forests or open environments), the abundance of nectar plants and the intensity of tilling were the most important factors differentiating older grasslands from the younger ones evolved from old Finnish hay fields cultivated prior to the 1940s.

AB  - Biomass is a crucial indicator of the carbon sequestration capacity of a vegetation ecosystem. Its dynamic is of interest because it impacts on the carbon cycle, which plays an important role in the global climate and its changes. This work presents a novel technique, able to transfer a calibrated regression model between different areas by exploiting an active learning methodology and using Shannon's entropy as a discriminator for sample selection. Model calibration is performed based on a reference area for which an extended ground truth is available and implemented via regression bootstrap. Then, re-calibration samples for model transfer are selected through active learning, allowing for choosing a limited number of points to be investigated for training data collection. Different sampling strategies and regression techniques have been tested to demonstrate that a significant reduction in the number of calibration samples does not affect the estimation performance. The proposed workflow has been tested on a dataset concerning Finnish forests. Experimental results show that the joint exploitation of regression ensembles and active learning dramatically reduces the amount of field sampling, providing aboveground biomass estimates comparable to those obtained using literature techniques, which need extended training sets to build reliable predictions.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides a range of experiences for people and various health benefits that support human well-being. To increase urban resilience, exceptional situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are important to learn from. This study aims to understand how the residents in Turku, a middle-sized city in Finland, perceived their outdoor recreation changed and how nature contributed to their subjective well-being during the early phases of the COVID-19. Sites of outdoor recreation and associated ecosystem service benefits were gathered through a map-based survey. In addition, the contribution of nature on subjective well-being was measured through Likert scale statements and the perceived changes in outdoor recreation behaviour were measured through self-reported number of days and from responses to open survey questions. Data was analysed through quantitative, qualitative and spatial methods. The results show that nearly half of the respondents increased outdoor recreation and the majority of outdoor recreation sites were visited more or as often as before the pandemic. The spatial analysis revealed that the most often visited recreation sites were near forests, semi-natural areas and housing areas as well as relatively close to respondent's residence. Respondents had various reasons for changes in outdoor recreation behaviour. For some a shift to working remotely and changes in everyday routines led to spending time outdoors more often and for some spending less while others avoided recreation in crowded areas due to social distancing. The results also indicate that people's opportunities to adapt to the pandemic conditions differ greatly. The nature's contribution to subjective well-being during COVID-19 was important regardless of respondent's outdoor recreation behaviour. Our study highlights that urban planning should respond to different needs for outdoor recreation in order to widely, and in a just way, promote the well-being benefits of urban nature during a pandemic, and to increase the resilience of the city and its residents. Participatory mapping can capture the variety in resident's values and identify key recreation sites of multiple ecosystem service benefits.

AB  - Political decision is a necessary, but not sufficient. precondition for policy implementation. The salmon-farming industry in Washington State provides an example on how institutions affect the implementation of political goals. This article addresses the institutional vulnerability of the marine salmon-farming industry in Washington State. The intersection of human society and nature in the context of salmon farming is composed of three distinct institutional carriers that concern the farmers' access to the coastal area: floating net pens. confinement in the coastal commons, and salmon as a farmed species. Each of these areas of conflict describes an encounter between salmon farming and a segment of public life where institutions give opposing interest group,, access to the policy formation process. Only a few farms are in operation, and at present increased production are unlikely. The industrial organization of the industry is contrasted to two large fin-fish-farming industries, the catfish-farming industry in the southeast USA and the salmon-farming industry in Norway, which provide examples of the effect of supportive and organizing institutions.

AB  - The efficient use of CO2-neutral biofuels offers a potential to reduce CO2 emissions by reducing fossil fuel consumption. By combining biofuel conversion with carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS), energy utilization with a negative CO2 balance can be achieved. The present paper studies the feasibility of combining CCS with different systems for co-production of biomass-based transportation fuels, power, and heat. The systems studied include both conventional and emerging technologies for recovery of chemicals and energy from black liquor, a residual of the kraft pulping process. A new method is introduced for economic evaluation of investments in energy facilities. The method considers economic credits for both energy products and CO2 reductions, thus including the potential economic benefits of emissions trading on a future market for trading of CO2 emissions quota. The paper estimates the prices of CO2 emissions quota that justify the extra investments required for more advanced systems with CCS. The potential of the alternative systems to reduce CO2 emissions in Sweden is assessed. CCS in biomass-based energy systems is identified as a CO2 reduction option

AB  - The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is the most important insect pest in Central European forests. Under climate change, its phenology is presumed to be changing and mass infestations becoming more likely. While several studies have investigated climate effects across a latitudinal gradient, it remains an open question how phenology will change depending on elevation and topology. Knowing how an altered climate is likely to affect bark beetle populations, particularly across diverse topographies and elevations, is essential for adaptive management. We developed a time-varying distributed delay model to predict the phenology of I. typographus. This approach has the particular advantage of capturing the variability within populations and thus representing its stage structure at any time. The model is applied for three regional climate change scenarios, A1B, A2 and RCP3PD, to the diverse topography of Switzerland, covering a large range of elevations, aspects and slopes. We found a strong negative relationship between voltinism and elevation. Under climate change, the model predicts an increasing number of generations over the whole elevational gradient, which will be more pronounced at low elevations. In contrast, the pre-shift in spring swarming is expected to be greater at higher elevations. In comparison, the general trend of faster beetle development on steep southern slopes is only of minor importance. Overall, the maximum elevation allowing a complete yearly generation will move upwards. Generally, the predicted increase in number of generations, earlier spring swarming, more aggregated swarming, together with a projected increase in drought and storm events, will result in a higher risk of mass infestations. This will increase the pressure on spruce stands particularly in the lowlands and require intensified management efforts. It calls for adapted long-term silvicultural strategies to mitigate the loss of ecosystem services such as timber production protection against rockfall and avalanches and carbon storage.

AB  - Horizontal heterogeneity causes difficulties in the eddy covariance technique for measuring surface fluxes, related to both advection and the confounding of temporal and spatial variability. Our aim here was to address this problem, using statistical modelling and footprint analysis, applied to a case study of fluxes of sensible heat and methane in a subarctic mire. We applied a new method to infer the spatial heterogeneity in fluxes of sensible heat and methane from a subarctic ecosystem in northern Sweden, where there were clear differences in surface types within the landscape. We inferred the flux from each of these surface types, using a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical model which includes coefficients for the different surface types. The approach is based on the variation in the flux observed at a single eddy covariance tower as the footprint changes over time. The method has applications wherever spatial heterogeneity is a concern in the interpretation of eddy covariance fluxes.

AB  - Fish farming has been a recurring topic of debate, not the least in the news media. The media is an important source of information about the aquaculture industry and its products to the public. However, the media is also an important debate arena, enabling representatives of the public, stakeholders, authorities, and the industry to engage in discussions as well as to influence policy and regulations. This paper focuses on the continuous debates in news media, the topics and storylines discussed, the various actors participating, and their arguments. Through a study of the content, positions, and producers of debate contributions in nine Norwegian newspapers, this paper sheds light on the public debate on aquaculture and the present controversies. Drawing on discourse theory, it is argued that the concept of discursive conflicts offers important insights into the controversies surrounding aquaculture. Discourse coalitions unite seemingly dissimilar and independent actors, and shared story lines provide political momentum, reduce complexity and reify the debate. However, such coalitions also contribute to maintaining the debate in a deadlock.

AB  - Ungulate browsing has been studied for several decades in the northern hemisphere. However, studies have mainly focused on just one or two ungulate species, while rarely contrasting the relative effects of summer and winter browsing. This limits our understanding of the dynamics and effects of browsing in landscapes where ungulate species diversity is increasing. We conducted a seasonal exclosure experiment on former clear-cuts in a multi-species ungulate system in Sweden, to investigate the relative impacts of summer and winter browsing on the conifers Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the tree species level. We tested for differences in individual conifer growth and demographic responses between Summer browsing, Winter browsing, No browsing, and Control treatment plots over a 4.5 year experimental period. We defined the demographic response as the distribution of conifers among different height classes. Individual growth rates and demographic responses of both conifer species were similar in the plots with No browsing (year-round exclosures) as in the Control plots with year-round browsing. Plots subject to Summer and Winter browsing differed in terms of their demographic response relative to plots with No browsing and Control plots; more stems reached taller height classes in the Summer and Winter browsing plots with slight differences between the conifer species. We discuss the different responses of Scots pine and Norway spruce considering their differences in palatability and their ability to tolerate plant-plant competition in a multi-species ungulate system, in light of potential associational effects. If fencing is intended to be used as a management practice to mitigate the impacts of deer browsing on conifer growth, our results suggest that a total exclusion of deer does not necessarily enhance conifer growth during the first years of regeneration.

AB  - Recent modelling work shows that the composition of local communities can be influenced by the configuration of the surrounding landscape, but many of these models assume that all community members display the same type of extinction-colonization dynamics. I use Aphodius dung beetles to test the hypothesis that interspecific differences in habitat selection and dispersal capacity may translate into differences in spatial population dynamics, even among closely related species coexisting on the same resource. If this is true, then groups of species with different. characteristics would show different responses to landscape configuration.
   I first divided the area of Finland into a grid, and used collection records to describe regional variation in the Aphodius fauna of open cattle pastures. I then sampled dung beetles on 131 cattle farms, to examine whether the subset of species found on each farm was related to the density of pastures in the surrounding grid square. Finally, I used historical records to analyze changes in dung beetle communities during the last century, when there was great loss of pasture.
   Overall, I found no relationship between landscape characteristics and the total proportion of the regional species pool that was found on each farm. However, the distribution of species among guilds with different habitat specificity did related to the configuration of the landscape, and the pattern was most pronounced in a specialists species with limited dispersal. Associations between community structure and landscape configuration were superimposed on two much larger and stronger patterns: a large-scale latitudinal gradient in regional species richness, and a decelerating gain of species to local communities with an increasing regional species pool. I conclude that ecological variation among community members is a crucial factor in the analysis of local community composition, and that local species richness should always be conditioned on regional richness.

AB  - Assemblages of epigeic ground beetles living in Norway spruce forests in north-eastern Poland in three age ranges: young: 20-30 years (A); middle-aged: 40-50 years (B); old: 70-80 years (C) were investigated. In each age category, 4 plots with 5 Barber traps were set up. Ground beetle assemblages were compared in terms of their abundance, species richness, and the Shannon H' index value. Quantitative ecological description of the carabids captured in the analysed age-classes of Norway spruce forests was performed, and the values of the mean individual biomass (MIB) were calculated. To determine the correlation between mean individual biomass and abundance of various ecological groups of carabid beetles, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated. The assemblages of ground beetles living in the Norway spruce forests in north-eastern Poland were characterised by quite large species richness (44 species in total). There were significant differences in species richness among the different ages of Norway spruce forests. The oldest Norway spruce stands (70-80 years old) had a smaller number of species and specimens of ground beetles as well as the highest MIB values in comparison with the younger spruce forests A and B. The results revealed that high MIB values were positively correlated with the presence of large ground beetle species with higher moisture requirements. Lower values of the MIB index were due to the presence of smaller open habitat macropterous species, with the spring type of breeding and associated with open areas.

AB  - Global expansion of salmon aquaculture is contingent upon finding new, large-capacity farming locations that are, increasingly, situated in dispersive environments with atypical ecological characteristics. The capacity of such sites to assimilate organic waste and the type and spatial extent of effects remain poorly understood. This study couples intensive spatial and temporal measurements of waste outputs with measurements of benthic ecological diversity and sediment biogeochemistry at a shallow dispersive site on the central west coast of Norway. Despite minimal visual changes to the seabed, pronounced biological effects were evident out to 600-1000 m away from the farm. Greatly enhanced faunal and microbial activity was tightly coupled with strong sediment respiratory responses in the form of oxygen uptake and ammonia efflux. The benthic response was highly dynamic, with rapid and prolific colonization by opportunistic fauna, followed by substantive recovery during the subsequent 7 mo fallowing period. The fate and pathways of farm waste through the environment was compartmentalized by converting measured parameters into equivalent carbon fluxes. During early production, approximately 30-40% of the waste was accounted for by the measured benthic processes, attributed to faunal respiratory activity and the physical properties including sediment type. Later in the production cycle, a sediment burial event was observed down-current from the farm. The remaining 60-70% of organic waste was assumed to be either assimilated in the water column, consumed by large, unquantified benthic fauna, or exported and dispersed. Shallow, dispersive sites therefore appear relatively resilient to acute near-field enrichment, but are also more likely to result in accumulative, far-field effects.

AB  - Assessing pre-defined strategies remains the status quo for studies supporting silvicultural decision-making for future forest management, yet, such strategies may not fully address decision-makers' preferences and uncertainty attitudes. We develop a continuous stand-level optimisation approach that integrates multiple decision criteria, uncertain input data based on ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and biological interactions. The optimisation aims to derive silvicultural strategies that closely align with the objectives and uncertainty attitudes of decisionmakers. The novel approach optimises tree species composition and harvesting regimes simultaneously. In our example, the decision criteria are the soil expectation value (SEV), the volume of timber harvested, the sum of cash flows and the average amount of carbon stored in the forest. We use input data for Norway spruce (Picea abies), Silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and integrate biological stand-level interactions represented by a) enhanced survival of tree species in mixed forests and b) the growth response of trees remaining after partial harvesting. The resulting optimal silvicultural strategies ranged from a clear-cutting system (when maximising SEV and ignoring uncertainty) to continuous cover forestry (maximising SEV and considering uncertainty). Our analyses did not support single species forestry - even the clear-cutting system suggested a mixed rather than pure forest. Silvicultural strategies that consider multiple criteria stored up to 47% more carbon than the clear-cutting system, but their SEVs were up to 39% lower. Biological interactions influence the optimal stand composition and harvesting regime, while establishment costs and the discount rate affect the level achieved for each management criterion. Lower survival due to changes in climate hardly influenced the model results. Our optimisation approach is flexible and may integrate many more and different criteria. It is useful to derive silvicultural strategies to guide science-based recommendations for various forest decision-makers.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting produces data on ecosystems, their condition, and the services they provide in a consistent and comparable form with the System of National Accounts (SNA). This study focused on accounting of recreational ecosystem services in the context of freshwaters in Finland. We used georeferenced data to measure the extent and condition of ecosystems available for recreation, and representative population data to measure the actual use of the services. In the monetary valuation of the recreational service, we applied the simulated exchange value method, which has been developed for the monetary valuation of non-market ecosystem services in accordance with the SNA. We extend the simulated exchange value method to incorporate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of recreational visits.

AB  - Wood-decaying fungi are essential for the functioning of forest ecosystems. They provide habitat for many other organisms and enable the regeneration of forests throughout the world. Since wood decomposition is a decisive process in nutrient recycling, soil formation and the carbon budget of forest ecosystems, it is receiving increasing attention from forest ecologists, pathologists and managers. Research has focussed on the factors driving the species-richness of wood-decomposing organisms and is moving on to analyse the effects of this species-richness on ecosystem functioning. Coarse woody debris (CWD) and its associated wood-decaying organisms have been drastically reduced in abundance and diversity by forestry and so these features often have potential as conservation indicators. Protective measures at a landscape level are needed for threatened wood-inhabiting fungi. These include restricting salvage operations in windthrow stands, actively encouraging the accumulation of deadwood in forests, and facilitating decay in standing trees by inoculating them with fungi. Here, we aim to collect and summarize recently produced work on deadwood ecology, pointing out research gaps and perspectives.

AB  - Tourism transport may lead to significant air emissions and congestion problems on road networks. This is particularly troublesome for nature-based tourism destinations, as they often are in rural areas with low transportation capacities and vulnerable nature. Tourism transport systems are poorly understood, especially multi-modal systems with land and sea dynamics. In this article, we propose a multi-modal transport model that integrates traffic both at land and sea generated by tourism. The model was built on data from an in-situ questionnaire and validated with traffic counts and video recordings for the Geiranger fjord UNESCO world heritage site in Norway. Following a parliament decision to eliminate emissions from sea traffic, four emission reduction scenarios were explored. Results show that cruise-generated tourist buses may significantly contribute to air emissions and the formation of road congestion and emphasize the necessity of having a holistic approach in analyzing consequences of emission reduction policies for tourism transport. The model may be used in transportation planning and policymaking to assess alternative pathways to sustainable tourism transport.

AB  - Soil microbial community structure is determined by environmental conditions and influenced by other factors, such as the intensity of the land use management. Studies addressing the effect of environmental factors and management on grassland soil microbial communities at the continental scale are missing, and the wide range of ecosystem services provided by these ecosystems are thus also wanting. To address this knowledge gap, this study presents data on grassland soil microbial communities along a pan-European agro-ecological gradient. The transect included five geographical locations (Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal mainland, Portugal Azores). At each location, soils were collected in two regions characterized by favourable and less favourable conditions for plant growth. In each of these ten regions, grasslands along a gradient of management intensity were selected, i.e. grassland under intensive, less intensive and extensive management. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) was used to characterize the microbial community structure (PLFA pattern) in relation to climatic and soil properties. Over the whole geographical range, the environmental properties determined the soil microbial community structure. In Sweden and Switzerland, the regional growth conditions had the strongest influence on the soil microbial communities, while in Germany, Portugal mainland and Azores the management intensity was more important. Splitting up this whole community response into individual groups reveals that, in general, saprotrophic fungal biomarkers were highest in extensively managed grasslands while bacterial biomarkers differed mainly between the regions. We conclude that at the transect level, climate and soil properties were the most important factors influencing soil bacterial community structure, while soil fungal groups were more responsive to grassland management intensity. Overall agricultural sustainability could benefit from informed soil health promoting management practices, and this study contributes to such knowledge, showing the importance of management for the soil microbial biomass and community structure.

AB  - Grass/legume leys are commonly included in the crop rotation in mixed farming systems in cold or humid regions in order to sustain the supply of nutrients and maintain soil fertility. Leys are also known to sequester soil organic carbon and also improve the structural stability and mechanical properties of soil. However, few studies have investigated the long-term effects of ley rotations on the architectural properties of the structural pore space in soil. We investigated the effects of grass/clover leys on soil structure in the topsoil and upper subsoil of a silt loam in a long-term field trial established in 1956 at Offer in northern Sweden. This experiment includes four treatments with varying proportions of ley (1, 2, 3 or 5 years) in 6-year rotations. We used X-ray tomography to quantify topsoil structural pore space at a resolution of 65 mu m in the first year of arable cropping following the ley break, a few weeks after sowing in spring. Earthworm populations were quantified by both hand-sorting and chemical extraction, while near-saturated infiltration was measured as a proxy for soil structure in the upper subsoil. In the topsoil, the treatments with a greater proportion of ley had larger organic carbon contents, smaller bulk densities and larger porosities. However, effects of crop rotation on the pore space were limited to pores smaller than 65 pm, as no treatment effects were found for the volume, size distribution, connectivity or complexity of the X-ray imaged pore space, even though the grass-clover leys promoted larger numbers and biomass of topsoil-dwelling earthworm species. Furthermore, no positive effects of grass/clover leys on organic carbon content and soil structure were found in the subsoil. The macropore infiltration capacity in upper subsoil was generally very small (overall median value of 3 mm h(-1)) indicating a lack of functional macroporosity below plough depth. Consistent with these results, no individuals of deep-burrowing earthworm species were found at the site, while previous observations showed only shallow rooting, both of which are attributed to the cold climate and poor subsoil drainage.

AB  - Planted forests of Sitka spruce, a non-native species from north-west America, are the major forest type in Great Britain and Ireland. Standard management involves even-aged stands, rotations of 40-50 years and a patch clear-felling system with artificial regeneration. However, forest policies support managing these forests for multifunctional objectives with increased diversity of species composition and stand structure. Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is an alternative silvicultural approach used to provide such diversity, but the amount of CCF forest is under 10% of the forest area, and less in Sitka spruce forests; This paper reviews research carried out in the last two decades to support the implementation of CCF in Sitka spruce planted forests; Stand structures and microclimate favouring natural regeneration are understood. Harvesting systems have been adapted for use in CCF stands, a single-tree growth model has been calibrated, comparative costs and revenues have been determined, and operational trials established. The interaction between thinning and wind stability in irregular stands is problematic, together with the lack of suitable species for growing in mixture with Sitka spruce; Introduction of an alternative silvicultural approach may take decades and must overcome technical challenges and cultural resistance.

AB  - Browning of surface waters because of increasing terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (OC) concentrations is a concern for drinking water providers and can impact land carbon storage. We show that positive trends in OC in 474 streams, lakes, and rivers in boreal and subarctic ecosystems in Norway, Sweden, and Finland between 1990 and 2013 are surprisingly constant across climatic gradients and catchment sizes (median, +1.4% year(-1); interquartile range, +0.8-2.0% year(-1)), implying that water bodies across the entire landscape are browning. The largest trends (median, +1.7% year(-1)) were found in regions impacted by strong reductions in sulfur deposition, while subarctic regions showed the least browning (median, +0.8% year(-1)). In dry regions, precipitation was a strong and positive driver of OC concentrations, declining in strength moving toward high rainfall sites. We estimate that a 10% increase in precipitation will increase mobilization of OC from soils to freshwaters by at least 30%, demonstrating the importance of climate wetting for the carbon cycle. We conclude that upon future increases in precipitation, current browning trends will continue across the entire aquatic continuum, requiring expensive adaptations in drinking water plants, increasing land to sea export of carbon, and impacting aquatic productivity and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Pyrolysis systems are a means to produce bioenergy products that can replace fossil fuels as well asproduce biochar. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment, where it also has a purpose as carbonsequestration. Although pyrolysis is a promising technology, it has not seen the large scaleimplementation that one might expect. This might however change if there was economic compensationfor the carbon sequestration service supplied by biochar. The purpose of the present work was toinvestigate at what carbon (C) price levels pyrolysis systems with combined biochar and heat generationwould become an economically feasible option in the Swedish agricultural sector. Furthermore, anobjective of the study was to investigate under what conditions the introduction of such a system wouldactually remain C negative, taking indirect land use change effects into account. The results for the studiedhypothetical case studies, indicated that a carbon price of approximately (sic)600-1200 per tonne C was necessary ifpyrolysis is to be economically viable. Concerning indirect effects, a land use change causing losses of morethan 40 and 80 tonne CO2/ha and year would make the pyrolysis systems net emitters of carbon.

AB  - Indicator choice is a crucial step in biodiversity assessments. Forest inventories have the potential to overcome data deficits for biodiversity monitoring on large spatial scales which is fundamental to reach biodiversity policy targets. Structural diversity indicators were taken from information theory to describe forest spatial heterogeneity. Their indicative value for forest stand variables is largely unknown. This case study explores these indicator-indicandum relationships in a lowland, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forest in Austria, Central Europe. We employed five indicators as surrogates for structural diversity which is an important part of forest biodiversity i.e., Clark & Evans-, Shannon, Stand Density, Diameter Differentiation Index, and Crown Competition factor. The indicators are evaluated by machine learning, to detect statistic inter-correlation in an indicator set and the relationship to twenty explanatory stand variables and five variable groups on a landscape scale. Using the R packages randomForest, VSURF, and randomForest Explainer, 1555 sample plots are considered in fifteen models. The model outcome is decisively impacted by the type and number of explanatory variables tested. Relationships to interval-scaled, common stand characteristics can be assessed most effectively. Variables of "stand age & density' are disproportionally indicated by our indicator set while other forest stand characteristics relevant to biodiversity are neglected. Within the indicator set, pronounced inter-correlation is detected. The Shannon Index indicates the overall high-est, the Stand Density Index the lowest number of stand characteristics. Machine learning proves to be a useful tool to overcome knowledge gaps and provides additional insights in indicator-indicandum relationships of structural diversity indicators.

AB  - We argue the need to select indicator species on empirical data to avoid influence of personal opinions. To test an empirical selection process based on a nested subset matrix, we sampled partivoltine dragonfly larvae from 74 small lakes in central Sweden. A nestedness matrix was set up using the 'nestedness temperature calculator' program, selecting 11 species as potential indicators of species richness. These were tested against a known indicator species for water quality (the pool frog) and plant diversity through inventories and comparison to existing surveys of biological values ('rich' lakes vs. 'ordinary' lakes). We could only see a trend towards the pool frog occurring in dragonfly-rich lakes, but found a significant connection between the number of aquatic plants along the shore line and the number of dragonfly species present. A significantly higher number of indicators were encountered in lakes previously surveyed as 'rich' in plants than in lakes classified as 'ordinary'. Dragonfly species richness therefore appears to be positively associated with species richness of vascular plants. We propose nestedness matrices to be a good selecting tool for indicator species, particularly in groups where the biology of the species is not well known. However, it is important to define what such indicators really indicate.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change is a current priority in forest management. Some of the suggested measures aim at maintaining the economic viability of timber production, others at maximizing social benefits, and others are recommended to increase the size of the carbon pool in forests. All of them need to be valid for a broad range of site conditions in order to capture the major part of the uncertainty of climate change. Discontinuing forest management with the intention of maximizing the carbon pool in the ecosystem is unrealistic in regions where a timber market needs to be supplied. Adaptive measures can be broadly classified into those that increase the heterogeneity of forests and those that affect the exposure of forests to disturbances. Increasing the heterogeneity distributes the risk imposed by climate change on more elements with different vulnerabilities. Typically, the tree species composition is scrutinized and new tree species or more suitable members from within the genetic spectrum of the respective tree species are favored. Managing the disturbance regime includes the modification of the stand structure and density to envisioned future needs and provisions against abiotic and biotic stressors. Adaptation measures such as the introduction of tree species that are more tolerant to future climate conditions into currently highly productive forests in most cases negatively affect the carbon sink capacity in the short-term. The same holds true for an adaptive decrease in stand density. Over the long run, however, increased resistance and resilience against changing environmental conditions and alternating disturbance regimes can substantially reduce the risk of carbon loss from managed forests which might reach unforeseen amounts if no adaptation measures are undertaken. The implementation of new forms of forest management depends not only on foresters, but also on the needs that society expresses towards the provision of forest products and ecosystem services.

AB  - Dead wood provides a huge terrestrial carbon stock and a habitat to wide-ranging organisms during its decay. Our brief review highlights that, in order to understand environmental change impacts on these functions, we need to quantify the contributions of different interacting biotic and abiotic drivers to wood decomposition. LOGLIFE is a new long-term 'common-garden' experiment to disentangle the effects of species' wood traits and site-related environmental drivers on wood decomposition dynamics and its associated diversity of microbial and invertebrate communities. This experiment is firmly rooted in pioneering experiments under the directorship of Terry Callaghan at Abisko Research Station, Sweden. LOGLIFE features two contrasting forest sites in the Netherlands, each hosting a similar set of coarse logs and branches of 10 tree species. LOGLIFE welcomes other researchers to test further questions concerning coarse wood decay that will also help to optimise forest management in view of carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Wind is the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe's forest ecosystems. In recent years, disturbance frequency and severity have been increasing at continental scale, a trend that is expected to continue under future anthropogenic climate change. Disturbance management is thus increasingly important for sustainable stewardship of forests, and requires tools to evaluate the effects of management alternatives and climatic changes on disturbance risk and ecosystem services. We here present a process-based model of wind disturbance impacts on forest ecosystems, integrated into the dynamic landscape simulation model iLand. The model operates at the level of individual trees and simulates wind disturbance events iteratively, i.e., dynamically accounting for changes in forest structure and newly created edges during the course of a storm. Both upwind gap size and local shelter from neighboring trees are considered in this regard, and critical wind speeds for uprooting and stem breakage are distinguished. The simulated disturbance size, pattern, and severity are thus emergent properties of the model. We evaluated the new simulation tool against satellite-derived data on the impact of the storm Gudrun (January 2005) on a 1391 ha forest landscape in south central Sweden. Both the overall damage percentage (observation: 21.7%, simulation: 21.4%) as well as the comparison of spatial damage patterns showed good correspondence between observations and predictions (prediction accuracy: 60.4%) if the full satellite-derived structural and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape was taken into account. Neglecting within-stand heterogeneity in forest conditions, i.e., the state-of-the-art in many stand-level risk models, resulted in a considerable underestimation of simulated damage, supporting the notion that tree-level complexity matters for assessing and modeling large-scale disturbances. A sensitivity analysis further showed that changes in wind speed and soil freezing could have potentially large impacts on disturbed area and patch size. The model presented here is available as open source. It can be used to study the effects of different silvicultural systems and future climates on wind risk, as well as to quantify the impacts of wind disturbance on ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. It thus contributes to improving our capacity to address changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal societies are characterized by being in transition with regard to economies, work, demography, and social-cultural life. Based on life biographies across three generations, we explore childhood and the coast as a home, tracing experienced changes as these are narrated from today back to 1945. The site of investigation is a coastal community in Norway, transformed from being a traditional homogenous fishing community until early 1970s, to an ethnically diverse society today with booming fish farming industry. Findings reveal a continuum of belonging between different families, illuminating significant social differentiation and inequalities. Home making and belonging are diverse and complex relational processes, embedded in the dynamics between global-local discourses. Contemporary youth is positioned, constrained and enabled by their various relational histories in choices related to homemaking and belonging.

AB  - Silvipastoral agroforestry in the form of forest grazing and wooded semi-natural pastures has historically been very important for the Swedish supply of food and wood products for local use. Since the end of the 1800s, this form of combined production system has greatly decreased and now covers only 1% of Sweden's land area. However, in recent decades it has gained increased relevance for reasons of landscape, biodiversity and climate. Agroforestry's decline and possible future increase are described through reviews of statistics and the literature read by farmers and politicians whose decisions are behind the development. Especially when it comes to biodiversity and climate, this review also includes the scientific literature. Surveys on Swedish citizens' valuation of silvipastoral agroforestry landscapes compared to treeless pasture and closed forest are also reviewed. It is possible that efforts to increase Sweden's low self-sufficiency in beef and lamb meat, the coming requirements according to the EU's nature restoration law and the need to limit climate change through carbon sequestration in trees may again increase the area of silvipastoral agroforestry. For this to be economically feasible, large grazing areas can be created out of remaining small scattered wooded semi-natural pastures and intervening forestland, which historically may have been grazed forests.

AB  - Large trees are important and unique organisms in forests, providing ecosystem services including carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and long-term storage. Some reports have raised concerns about the global decline of large trees. Based on observations from two regions in Finland and three regions in the United States we report that trends of large trees during recent decades have been surprisingly variable among regions. In southern Finland, the growing stock volume of trees larger than 30 cm at breast height increased nearly five-fold during the second half of the 20th century, yet more recently ceased to expand. In the United States, large hardwood trees have become increasingly common in the Northeast since the 1950s, while large softwood trees declined until the mid 1990s as a consequence of harvests in the Pacific region, and then rebounded when harvesting there was reduced. We conclude that in the regions studied, the history of land use and forest management governs changes of the diameter-class distributions of tree populations. Large trees have significant benefits; for example, they can constitute a large proportion of the carbon stock and affect greatly the carbon density of forests. Large trees usually have deeper roots and long lifetimes. They affect forest structure and function and provide habitats for other species. An accumulating stock of large trees in existing forests may have negligible direct biophysical effects on climate through transpiration or forest albedo. Understanding changes in the demography of tree populations makes a contribution to estimating the past impact and future potential of forests in the global carbon budget and to assessing other ecosystem services of forests.

AB  - Multifunctional agriculture provides noncommodity functions and services along with food, feed and bioenergy feedstocks, for example by preserving or promoting biodiversity, improving soil fertility, mitigating climate change and environmental degradation, and contributing to the socio-economic viability of rural areas. Producing biomass for bioenergy from low-input perennial species mixtures on marginal land has the potential to support biodiversity and soil carbon sequestration in synergy with greenhouse gas mitigation. We compared biomass production in species-rich mixtures of perennial grasses, legumes and forbs with pure-stand grasses and relatively species-poor mixtures under different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Field experiments were performed on different types of marginal land, that is agricultural field margins and land with poor soil fertility, at four sites in southernmost and western Sweden. Biomass production was measured for three years in perennial grasses grown as pure stands, in legume-grass mixtures, and legume-grass-forb mixtures across a species richness gradient. In unfertilized species-rich mixtures, average biomass yields per experimental site and year were in the range from 3 to 9 metric ton DM ha(-1) yr(-1). While the most productive pure-stand grasses fertilized with 60-120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) often produced higher biomass yields than unfertilized mixtures, these differences were generally smaller than the variations between years and sites. Calculations of climate impact using the harvested biomass for conversion to biogas as vehicle fuel showed that the average greenhouse gas emissions per energy unit were about 50% lower in unfertilized systems than in treatments fertilized with 100-120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Our findings thereby show that unfertilized species-rich perennial plant mixtures on marginal land provide resource-efficient biomass production and contribute to the mitigation of climate change. Perennial species mixtures managed with low inputs thus promote synergies between productivity and biodiversity in the perspective of climate-smart and multifunctional biomass production.

AB  - AimsTo use open access models of predicted seabird distribution data in the Arctic to create rapid assessment biodiversity maps for management purposes and for prioritization of conservation.
   LocationHigh Arctic, North of 60 degrees latitude.
   MethodsThe predicted distributions of 27 species of Arctic seabirds were combined to create a seabird biodiversity map. The GIS layers created were based on peer-reviewed model outputs which were calculated using the random forest algorithm and supplemented with ISO standardized metadata for quality assurance. We have overlain the species diversity and occurrence maps with known shipping lanes and areas of human activities in the Arctic to highlight areas of potential human conflict with pelagic seabirds.
   ResultsEntry points to the Arctic Basin for example Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Chukchi Sea, Greenland Sea and Norwegian Sea are specific conflict zones with mean number of species occurring within 20km of shipping zones ranging from 17 to 19 (63-70% of modelled species). We also show that these are areas of the highest intensity of human activities in the Arctic (fishing, ship traffic and accident rates).
   Main conclusionThese Arctic seabird biodiversity maps can be used to make decisions which take into account ecology and socio-economy (e.g. Marxan analysis and marine protected areas MPAs) and for ecological/economic studies which can help to create a pro-active management scheme. This is particularly important due to the future increase in human impacts in the Arctic (i.e. fishing, tourism and especially shipping). By improving upon these models and further examination into the interactions between seabirds and humans in the Arctic, we can guide important policy decisions to protect Arctic biodiversity.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) provide two interlinked platforms for the assessment of impacts on biodiversity caused by human developments. Although it might be too early to draw conclusions on the efficiency of SEA to assess such impacts, a number of persistent problems have been identified in the case of EIA. Some of these shortcomings concern the lack of proper prediction and impact quantification, and the inadequate/insufficient assessment of cumulative effects. A number of problems are related to the scale(s) at which the assessment is performed. SEA may provide a more adequate framework than EIA to discuss scale-related issues (i.e. cumulative impacts) but it also requires the use of adapted tools. This paper presents a case study where a GIS-based habitat model for the lesser spotted woodpecker is tested, validated and applied to a planning scenario in the Stockholm region in Sweden. The results show that the method adopted offers great prospects to contribute to a better assessment of biodiversity-related impacts. Even though some limitations remain in the form of data requirement and interpretation of the results, the model produced continuous, quantified predictions over the study area and provided a relevant basis for the assessment of cumulative effects. Furthermore, this paper discusses potential conflicts between different scales involved in the assessment - related to administrative boundaries, ecological processes, data availability, the method adopted to perform the assessment and temporal aspects.

AB  - An important question in conservation biology, is whether the biodiversity of different taxa is correlated. We studied the extent to which the number of species of six different taxa-plants. birds, butterflies, bumblebees, ground beetles, and dung beetles-in 31 Swedish seminatural grasslands covary,, and whether species diversity, can be related to habitat variables, During 1990 and 1997 we surveyed plants and animals with appropriate techniques for each taxa and mapped the grassland habitat. fit general. correlations between taxa were few. Grassland plant diversity (currently used as an indicator for conservation value) was Bumblebee diversity was significantly only, significantly positively correlated to total bird diversity related to both total and grassland butterflies, whereas there was a significant negative relationship between grassland birds and dung beetles. Plants, birds, bumblebees, rind butterflies showed significant similarities in patterns of species composition, as did birds, butterflies, grassland butterflies, and ground beetles. The total number of plants and both subsets of birds (total and grassland) were significantly positively related to area, whereas there was a significant negative association between area and dung-beetle, diversity. The diversity of both butterflies and bumblebees was significantly, negatively related to The proportion of short-grazed field layer. Bumblebees showed a positive relationship with junipers, whereas ground beetles and grassland birds were negatively associated with trees. The total number of bird species was Positively influenced 17). the occurrence of shrubs. Our results suggest that neither the species richness of grassland plants nor that other of the surveyed taxa can be used as an indicator for total biodiversity, The lack of similar patterns of species composition among taxa also makes it difficult to define functional groups with similar habitat demands. Until we have more detailed knowledge of the demands; of species and taxa. it is important that we direct management efforts so that we provide a wide spectrum of grassland characteristics.

AB  - Dispersal is a fundamental ecological process that, on an individual level, is associated with intrinsic and fixed personality traits such as 'boldness'. However, it is unknown whether personality traits or behavioural syndromes might change as a consequence of dispersal itself. We analysed 14 GPS-collared grey wolves, Canis lupus, in Finland that dispersed from their natal territories and settled in new territories, as well as 22 time-matched nondispersing controls. We used wolf avoidance of low-use forest roads, high-use primary roads and houses as proxies for boldness, and we estimated wolf responses to these features across spatial scales and across dispersal phases. Wolves, which already occupy portions of Finland with low human density, expanded into more human-impacted areas, but with a strong large-scale selection for relatively low human presence. At the finer scale, avoidance of human elements varied as a function of dispersal phase. During dispersal, avoidance of forest roads, primary roads and houses was substantially lower than in natal territories, reflecting the need to take more risks while moving in a small group (alone or with a single mate) in unfamiliar environments. After settling in new territories, the strength of avoidance of those elements continued to be lower than in natal territories, even after controlling for changes in availability. These results suggest that experiences gained across a major life-history transition, such as dispersal, might themselves influence personality traits.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases are a significant health problem worldwide and have become even more pervasive in Europe due to the increasing abundance of tick species, especially the common tick (Ixodes ricinus L.). Moreover, in recent years, there have been changes in tick geographical distribution, the occurrence of new tick species, and an expansion in abundance driven by changes in forest management and climate change. Therefore, this paper's objective is to determine the effect of tree species composition and forest structure on the abundance of I. ricinus in various forest stands in Czechia. Altogether, we analyzed 4195 collected ticks on 56 monitored research plots, of which 4182 individuals were I. ricinus, 4 individuals were Dermacentor reticulatus Fabricius, and 7 individuals were Haemaphysalis concinna C. L. Koch. The average density reached 1.21 ticks per 10 m2. The highest I. ricinus abundance was observed in coniferous stands (especially in Scotch pine-Pinus sylvestris L.) and forest edges with a high incidence of wild ungulate habitat signs. Contrarily, the lowest tick numbers were in clear-cut biotopes and mixed stands. Increasing vertical structure had a significant (p < 0.05) negative effect on I. ricinus abun-dance, similar to tree species diversity (richness, evenness, heterogeneity) and complex stand diversity on nymph stage abundance. Close-to-nature silviculture of mixed forests, which are resistant to climate extremes, could reduce the tick abundance, as well as the presence of tick-borne diseases compared to standard coniferous monocultures, which are receding now due to climate change. Based on this knowledge, it should be possible to predict the I. ricinus abundance under changing environmental conditions in the Central European region.

AB  - To evaluate the radiological impact of potential releases to the biosphere from a geological repository for spent nuclear fuel, it is necessary to assess the long-term dynamics of the distribution of radionuclides in the environment. In this paper, we propose an approach for making prognoses of the distribution and fluxes of radionuclides released from the geosphere, in discharges of contaminated groundwater, to an evolving landscape. The biosphere changes during the temperate part (spanning approximately 20 000 years) of an interglacial period are handled by building biosphere models for the projected succession of situations. Radionuclide transport in the landscape is modeled dynamically with a series of interconnected radioecological models of those ecosystem types (sea, lake, running water, mire, agricultural land and forest) that occur at present, and are projected to occur in the future, in a candidate area for a geological repository in Sweden. The transformation between ecosystems is modeled as discrete events occurring every thousand years by substituting one model by another. Examples of predictions of the radionuclide distribution in the landscape are presented for several scenarios with discharge locations varying in time and space. The article also outlines an approach for estimating the exposure of man resulting from all possible reasonable uses of a potentially contaminated landscape, which was used for derivation of Landscape Dose Factors.

AB  - Models attempting to predict treeline shifts in changing climates must include the relevant ecological processes in sufficient detail. A previous correlative model study has pointed to nutrients, competition, and temperature as the most important factors shaping the treelines of Pinus sylvestris L., Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. and Betula pubescens Ehrh. in Finnish Lapland. Here, we applied a widely used process-based dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) to (i) test its capability to simulate observed spatial and temporal patterns of the main tree species in Finnish Lapland, and (ii) to explore the model representation of important processes in order to guide further model development. A European parameterization of LPJ-GUESS overestimated especially P. abies biomass and the species' northern range limit. We identified implemented processes to adjust (competition, disturbance) and crucial processes in boreal forests to include (nutrient limitation, forest management) which account for the model's failure to (edaphically) restrict P. abies in Finnish Lapland and the resulting species imbalance. Key competitive mechanisms are shade and drought tolerance, nutrient limitation, fire resistance, and susceptibility to disturbances (storm, herbivory) which we discussed with respect to boreal ecology and promising model developments to provide a starting point for future model development.

AB  - Species distributions are influenced by habitat conditions and ecological processes at multiple spatial scales. An understanding of the importance of habitat characteristics at different spatial scales is important when developing biodiversity conservation measures.
   We investigated the effect of habitat characteristics or amount at three spatial scales on the occurrence of saproxylic (=dead wood-dependent) beetles.
   Saproxylic beetles were sampled under the bark of dead wood in a managed forest landscape in central Sweden. We modelled the occurrence probability in dead wood items of 44 species (all species occurring in > 2 % of the items), based on dead wood item characteristics, forest stand characteristics, and habitat connectivity (i.e. area of potentially suitable forest stands in the surrounding of each stand), using hierarchical Bayesian regression.
   For the majority of species, dead wood item characteristics (especially tree species and whether standing or downed) were more important than measured stand characteristics and habitat connectivity. Whether the stands were clear-cuts, mature forests, or reserves affected some species, whereas the stand-level amount of dead wood per hectare was not important for any species. Habitat connectivity improved the occurrence models for about a half of the species, but there were both positive and negative relationships, and they were generally weak.
   Forest management should include creation and retention of a high diversity of dead wood to sustain habitat for all species. In a forest-dominated landscape, the spatial distribution of dead wood is of little importance for common saproxylic beetle species.

AB  - European aspen deadwood is extensively studied as a habitat for saproxylic species, while less is known of its dynamics and role in carbon sequestration. We studied unmanaged mature (41-60 years), moderately overmature (61-80 years), overmature (81-100 years), and old-growth (101-140 years) and managed mature and moderately overmature aspen stands on fertile mineral soils. In unmanaged stands, marginal mean CWD volume was from 67.3 +/- 12.1 m(3) ha(-1) in moderately overmature to 92.4 +/- 5.1 m(3) ha(-1) in old-growth stands, with corresponding marginal mean CWD carbon pool 8.2 +/- 1.6 t ha(-1) and 12.5 +/- 0.7 t ha(-1) (all p > 0.05), respectively. High CWD volume was present in most stands, by at least two-thirds of plots comprising more than 20 m(3) ha(-1), and about half of CWD was larger than 30 cm in diameter. Changes in CWD species composition toward a higher proportion of deciduous deadwood in old-growth stands, together with a high volume of recently dead trees, suggest early senescence of the dominant aspen cohort.

AB  - Between 1882 and 1886 the water level of Lake Hjalmaren, Sweden was lowered almost-equal-to 130 cm. As a consequence, a large number of new islands arose. From 30 such islands we have complete lists of vascular plant species with notes on their abundance from 1886, 1892, 1903-1904, 1927-1928, and 1984-1985.
   The 112 most important species were grouped as pioneers, early-, mid-, or late-successional, depending on when in the sere they were most abundant or frequent. Several species (referred to as stayers) remained common once they had entered the succession.
   For the 112 species we collected literature data on height, life form, fecundity, mating system, pollination, seed size, dispersal, and relation to nitrogen and light, and the successional groups were compared with regard to these attributes.
   The characteristics of the pioneers were distinct from other groups. Eight of the 13 pioneers were annuals (therophytes), all of which were predominantly autogamous, indicating a strong coupling between these life history traits. After the pioneer stage there was no continuous change in these attributes.
   The seeds in pioneers were not smaller than in early- or midsuccessional species, and seed size did not differ between annuals and perennials. Water dispersal was very important, and therefore dispersal success put no constraint on seed size. Species with the heaviest seeds arrived late; notably they were bird dispersed. Only among wind-dispersed trees and shrubs was there a gradual increase in seed mass over succession.
   The Ellenberg light indicator value showed a slight decrease over time, as did a variable measuring preference for open habitats. We propose that physiology may be more important than life history for species replacements after the pioneer stage.

AB  - Soil microbial biomass data derived from fumigation-extraction (FE), substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and ATP estimations differed significantly and were significantly correlated, which agrees to previous studies. In a second step, the SIR/FE, ATP/FE and SIR/ATP ratios were calculated to evaluate the glucose-responsive and active component of the microbial (active and resting) biomass and the glucose-responsive component of the active microbiota. Soils were sampled along gradients within and between associated ecosystems in Northern Germany, Denmark and along a gradient of heavy metal pollution in Finland. The ratios indicated that the active portion and glucose-responsive component decreased with proceeding litter decomposition, higher degree of sustainable land management practices and higher degree of heavy metal contamination.

AB  - We investigated the immediate response of mature (mean stand age 102 years) boreal spruce forest understorey vegetation to four different felling methods on 1-ha study plots in southern Finland. We hypothesized that understorey vegetation response depends on the intensity of the felling method. Vegetation was sampled before the treatments and the year following them, when resident understorey vegetation had not had time to recover from the disturbance and pioneer species were still scarce or absent.
   Response of understorey vegetation differed significantly between the treatments. Bryophyte species number decreased significantly in single-tree selection system felling (33% of stand volume felled). retention Felling (93% felled) and standard clear felling, but remained at the pre-treatment level in gap felling (50% felled) and in control plots. Bryophyte cover decreased significantly over all treatments, except the residuals of the gap felling and the controls. Number of vascular plant species decreased significantly only in clear felling and retention felling, while cover of vascular plants decreased significantly in all treatments, including controls. Vegetation response to gap felling and single-tree selection system felling was rather similar at the stand level. However, there were significant differences between the felled areas and residuals in gap felling in post-treatment vegetation species composition and cover. Retention felling and clear felling did not differ significantly from each other in terms of vegetation response. Apparently the residual tree groups, which contained 7% of the pre-treatment stand volume, were too small to have significant sheltering effect on late successional vegetation in or outside of residuals.

AB  - Species composition along with spatial and age structure are the main attributes of forest ecosystems. The diversity of scree forests and herb-rich beech forests was analyzed in the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area, the Czech Republic. The paper objective was to evaluate forest structure and dynamics of species diversity of tree layer, natural regeneration and herb layer in the period 1961-2016. Scree forests were structurally, and species very rich forest stands, in herb-rich beech forests the stands were of medium richness. Studied stands managed by small-scale methods, in the past especially by coppicing and later by shelterwood and selection felling, have maintained high species biodiversity during the 55 years of observation. Substantially higher biodiversity was found out in scree forests compared to herb-rich beech forests. Based on the comparison of predominantly coppiced forest stand and stand of generative origin at sites of scree forests, coppice have maintained higher biodiversity than high forests. Species richness increased during the observation period, but species evenness had mostly decreasing tendency. Species heterogeneity in coppiced scree forests increased in tree layer and natural regeneration, but it decreased in herb layer; inverse dynamics was observed in the high forests. Changes in biodiversity dynamics were remarkable for coppice, while high forests showed relatively high level of stability. During study period herb population of light-demanding species and species characteristic for broadleaved forests decreased, while an increase in shade tolerant, moisture-demanding and nutrient-demanding species, especially nitrophilous species was confirmed. Moreover, occurrence of thermophilic plants increased, respectively cold-tolerant plant population decreased in relation to climate change.

AB  - The effect of summer cottages on land bird numbers was studied in the archipelago of SW-Finland. Bird fauna was very similar on cottage and non-cottage islands, with the following exceptions: The Wagtail Motacilla alba was significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant on cottage islands. The Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and the Willow Tit Parus montanus were nearly significantly (P < 0.10) more abundant on non cottage islands. In the grouping of species based on nesting habits, birds nesting in nest boxes and other man-made structures were more abundant on cottage islands. The mean species richness and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index H' were significantly greater on cottage islands than on non-cottage islands. However, if the data are combined and treated as one sample for cottage islands and the other for non-cottage islands, the differences in species richness and diversity between island groups disappear.

AB  - To study potential consequences of climate-induced changes in the biotic disturbance regime at regional to national scale we integrated a model of Ips typographus (L. Scol. Col.) damages into the large-scale forest scenario model EFISCEN. A two-stage multivariate statistical meta-model was used to upscale stand level damages by bark beetles as simulated in the hybrid forest patch model PICUS v1.41. Comparing EFISCEN simulations including the new bark beetle disturbance module against a 15-year damage time series for Austria showed good agreement at province level (RA(2) between 0.496 and 0.802). A scenario analysis of climate change impacts on bark beetle-induced damages in Austria's Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] forests resulted in a strong increase in damages (from 1.33 MmA(3)A a(-1), period 1990-2004, to 4.46 MmA(3)A a(-1), period 2095-2099). Studying two adaptive management strategies (species change) revealed a considerable time-lag between the start of adaptation measures and a decrease in simulated damages by bark beetles.

AB  - Several characteristics of habitats of herbivores and their food-plant communities, such as plant-species composition and plant quality, influence population genetics of both herbivores and their host plants. We investigated how different ecological and geographic factors affect genetic variation in and differentiation of 23 populations of the oligophagous seed predator Lygaeus equestris (Heteroptera) in southwestern Finland and in eastern Sweden. We tested whether genetic differentiation of the L. equestris populations was related to the similarity of vegetation, and whether there was more within-population genetic variation in habitats with a high number of plant species or in those with a large population of the primary food plant, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria. We also tested whether genetic differentiation of the populations was related to the geographic distance, and whether location of the populations on islands or on mainland, island size, or population size affected within-population genetic variation. Pairwise FST ranged from 0 to 0.1 indicating low to moderate genetic differentiation of populations. Differentiation increased with geographic distance between the populations, but was not related to the similarity of vegetation between the habitats. Genetic variation within the L. equestris populations did not increase with the population size of the primary food plant. However, the more diverse the plant community the higher was the level of genetic variation within the L. equestris population. Furthermore, the level of genetic variation did not vary significantly between island and mainland populations. The effect of the population size on within-population genetic variation was related to island size. Usually small populations are susceptible to loss of genetic variation, but small L. equestris populations on large islands seemed to maintain a relatively high level of within-population genetic variation. Our findings suggest that, in addition to geographic and species-specific ecological factors, the plant community affects population genetic structure of oligophagous herbivores.

AB  - Aspen mosaic-associated virus (AsMaV) is a newly identified Emaravirus, in the family Fimoviridae, Bunyavirales, associated with mosaic symptoms in aspen trees (Populus tremula). Aspen trees are widely distributed in Europe and understanding the population structure of AsMaV may aid in the development of better management strategies. The virus genome consists of five negative sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) molecules. To investigate the genetic diversity and population parameters of AsMaV, different regions of the genome were amplified and analyzed and full-length sequence of the divergent isolates were cloned and sequenced. The results show that RNA3 or nucleoprotein is a good representative for studying genetic diversity in AsMaV. Developed RT- PCR-RFLP was able to identify areas with a higher number of haplotypes and could be applied for screening the large number of samples. In general, AsMaV has a conserved genome and based on the phylogenetic studies, geographical structuring was observed in AsMaV isolates from Sweden and Finland, which could be attributed to founder effects. The genome of AsMaV is under purifying selection but not distributed uniformly on genomic RNAs. Distant AsMaV isolates displayed amino acid sequence variations compared to other isolates, and bioinformatic analysis predicted potential post-translational modification sites in some viral proteins.

AB  - The bryophyte vegetation of 3 pairs of unmanaged and managed forest stands, representing Oxalis drained peatland, Aegopodium and Oxalis forest site type, were compared. The total number of bryophyte species in unmanaged stands was 74 and that in managed stands 54. Out of the 20 species occurring only in unmanaged forests, 9 grow on decaying wood, and 3 on trunks or bases of big trees; 13 of them were hepatics. In unmanaged forests 11 hemerophobic species were recorded altogether. Although the difference in substrate and species diversity between unmanaged and managed stands is not statistically significant, in unmanaged forests more substrates characteristic for an old-growth stand are available, and the percentage of species preferring dryer habitats or prolonged humidity is a bit higher than in managed forests; the percentage of species associated with better illuminated habitats is higher in managed forests. Analysis of classification structure of the bryophyte layer synusia shows that the number of societies is also higher in unmanaged forests. This is associated with more numerous microhabitats; the average light and humidity indices calculated for every society, confirm this conclusion. The large discrepancy in bryophyte layer classification structure in old-growth and managed forests of the same forest site type is manifested not so much by species content in synusia as by their abundance proportions. The larger diversity of classification units in unmanaged forests is also seen at the synusia facies level; four of nine facies are confined exclusively to unmanaged stands. This is a strong argument for the informativeness of bryophyte layer classification structure for purposes of indication and monitoring as well.

AB  - Ants can influence ecological processes, such as the transfer of elements or radionuclides, in several ways. For example, they redistribute materials while foraging and maintaining their nests and have an important role in terrestrial food webs. Quantitative data of the transfer of elements into ants is needed, e.g., for developing improved radioecological models. In this study, samples of red wood ants (genus Formica), nest material, litter and soil were collected from a former uranium mining site in Eastern Finland. Concentrations of 33 elements were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy/Optical Emission Spectroscopy. Estimated element concentrations in spruce needles were used as a proxy for studying the transfer of elements into ants via aphids because spruces host the most important aphid farms in boreal forests. Empirically determined organism/ medium concentration ratios (CRs) are commonly used in radioecological models. Ant/soil CRs were calculated and the validity of the fundamental assumption behind the of use of CRs (linear transfer) was evaluated. Elements that accumulated in ants in comparison to other compartments were cadmium, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, and zinc. Ant uranium concentrations were low in comparison to soil, litter, or nest material but slightly elevated in comparison to spruce needles. Ant element concentrations were quite constant regardless of the soil concentrations. Non-linear transfer models could therefore describe the soil-to-ant transfer better than conventional CRs.

AB  - The article summarizes results obtained from several field experiments, measured in uneven-aged forests during a long period; from the 1930s until the present. Experiments have been established in both Norway spruce- and Scots pine-dominated stands. The purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of uneven-aged forest management under Finnish conditions and compare uneven-aged management to the current even-aged forestry. The analysed datasets demonstrate relatively rich regeneration under many types of tree canopies. The number of stabilized (height 0.1-1.3 m) spruce seedlings does not always correlate with the stand density. The amount of small labile (height < 0.1 m) spruce seedlings may even increase with increasing stand volume. Contrary to spruce, the regeneration of birch and pine decreases with increasing stand volume. The yield comparisons show that uneven-aged stands have often grown faster than even-aged stands with the same post-cutting stand density. High thinnings have resulted in better volume increments than low thinnings. Recent studies show that uneven-aged management is more profitable than even-aged rotation forestry (RF), especially with high discount rates. Uneven-aged management seems to be superior to current even-aged RF also with respect to environmental and multifunctional aspects, such as carbon sequestration, bilberry yield, structural diversity and scenic values.

AB  - In China, artificial forests have become key raw material providers for the wood industry, and shouldered the burden of improving ecological system. Silviculture and forest management measures in China have entered an era of mechanization, inevitably need more fossil fuels and synthetic drugs, which harm to ecological environment and human beings. This study evaluates the environmental impact of larix plantation management processes in north-east China by life cycle assessment (LCA) method which is applied to evaluate the environmental load of the forest system from a cradle-to-gate perspective. The functional unit of this study is taken as 1 ha mature forest, and the scenario included stand establishment, tending of young forest and thinning. According to our results, the phase of tending of young forest shows a great degree of environment load. Further, weeding process during the life cycle of mature forest seems to be the main contributor to almost all the impact categories with high contributing ratios, and therefore identified as hotspots of this system boundaries. Other forestry measures such as fertilization and irrigation activities also made significant contributions to the categories under assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Valuing nature's benefits in monetary terms is necessary for policy-makers facing trade-offs in how to spend limited financial resources on environmental protection. We provide information to assess trade-offs associated with the management of seagrass beds, which provide a number of ecosystem services, but are presently impacted by many stressors. We develop an interdisciplinary framework for valuing multiple ecosystem services and apply it to the case of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a dominant seagrass species in the northern hemisphere. We identify and quantify links between three eelgrass functions (habitat for fish, carbon, and nitrogen uptake) and economic goods in Sweden, quantify these using ecological endpoints, estimate the marginal average value of the impact of losing one hectare of eelgrass along the Swedish northwest coast on welfare in monetary terms, and aggregate these values while considering double-counting. Over a 20-50 year period we find that compared to unvegetated habitats, a hectare of eelgrass, including the organic material accumulated in the sediment, produces an additional 626 kg cod fishes and 7535 wrasse individuals and sequesters 98.6 ton carbon and 466 kg nitrogen. We value the flow of future benefits associated with commercial fishing, avoided climate change damages, and reduced eutrophication at 170,000 SEK in 2014 (20,700 US$) or 11,000 SEK (1300 US$) annualized at 4%. Fish production, which is the most commonly valued ecosystem service in the seagrass literature, only represented 25% of the total value whereas a conservative estimate of nitrogen regulation constituted 46%, suggesting that most seagrass beds are undervalued. Comparing these values with historic losses of eelgrass we show that the Swedish northwest coast has suffered a substantial reduction in fish production and mineral regulation. Future work should improve the understanding of the geographic scale of eelgrass functions, how local variables affect the value of these functions, and how to defensibly aggregate a multitude of economic values.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation implies a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches, but also an increase of new habitat. Simulations of patterns and geometry of landscapes with decreasing proportion of the suitable habitat give rise to the prediction that the effect of habitat fragmentation on e.g. population size of a species would be primarily through habitat loss in landscape with a high proportion of suitable habitat. However, as the proportion of suitable habitat decreases in the landscape, area and isolation effects start influencing the population size of the species. Hence, the relative importance of pure habitat loss, patch size and isolation are expected to differ at different degrees of habitat fragmentation. This conclusion was supported by a review of studies on birds and mammals in habitat patches in landscapes with different proportions of suitable habitat: the random sample hypothesis was a good predictor of the effects of habitat fragmentation in landscapes with more than 30% of suitable habitat. In these landscapes, habitat fragmentation is primarily habitat loss. However, in landscapes with highly fragmented habitat, patch size and isolation will complement the effect of habitat loss and the loss of species or decline in population size will be greater than expected from habitat loss alone. Habitat patches are parts of the landscape mosaic and the presence of a species in a patch may be a function not only of patch size and isolation, but also of the neighbouring habitat Habitat generalists may survive in very small patches because they can also utilize resources in the surroundings. Furthermore, the total species diversity across habitats in a given landscape may increase when new patches of habitat are created within the continuous habitat, since new species may be found in these new habitats, even if they are human-made.

AB  - We identify, describe qualitatively, quantify biophysically and, if possible, monetarily valuate the most important ecosystem services in Swedish forests. Existing Swedish and Nordic research and statistics within this area are reviewed and used to develop a first framework for the valuation of ecosystem services in Swedish forests. We base our analysis on the CICES framework and the Cascade-model. Despite the rather long occurrence and use of the concept of ecosystem services, we do not yet have enough information on the status and economic value of services in Swedish forests. The value of the forest ecosystem services is at best an indication of the different multifunctional objectives that should be met in the management of the Swedish forests. The five most central ecosystem services in Swedish forests according to annual flow are timber and pulpwood, bioenergy, game, climate regulation and recreation and training, each estimated to have a monetary value of several billion SEK. The different ecosystem services in multipurpose forests interact with each other and may lead to conflicts between use and conservation. We identified a number of trade-offs and synergies between services focusing on the five above ecosystem services.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges when addressing issues in complex social-ecological systems (SES), is the need for an efficient interdisciplinary framework when large-magnitude social and ecological disturbances occur. Teams comprising of scientists from different backgrounds and disciplines are frequently called upon to propose research methods and results that can be useful for policy and decision makers. However, most of the outcomes from these pluri-disciplinary teams appear extremely difficult to implement within a bigger picture because concepts, hypotheses, methods, and results are specific to each discipline. Here, we propose a reverse engineering (RE) method to define the scientific needs that could help policy makers and citizens to assess the impacts of socioeconomic "disruptors" on social-ecological systems. We present this method using the example of an ongoing wood biomass energy plant (Gardanne) in the French Mediterranean region. In the Mediterranean region, species diversity is high, the forest cover is ample, but difficult access and low forest productivity make any biomass policy an ecological and social disruption. Our method is based on three complementary approaches to (1) describe the social-ecosystems, (2) draw up a map of interactions between actors and the impacts on the ecosystem, and (3) identify relevant questions needed for a global analysis of the impacts and potentialities of adaptation of actors and the ecosystems to the perturbation and the connections needed between the different disciplines. Our analysis showed that knowledge gaps have to be filled to assess forest resource vulnerability and better estimate how the different resource used (solid wood, biomass, landscape) competed together. Finally, we discuss how this method could be integrated into a broader transdisciplinary work allowing a coproduction of knowledge and solutions on a SES.

AB  - Weed communities of organically cropped spring cereal stands in the southern and the northwestern coastal regions of Finland (= south and northwest, respectively) were compared with respect to number of species, frequency of occurrence, density and dry weight. Regional specialization of agricultural production along with differences in climate and soil properties were expected to generate differences in weed communities between south and northwest. Total and average numbers of species were higher in the south than in the northwest (33 vs. 26 and 15.6 vs. 10.0, respectively). Some rare species (e.g. Papaver dubium) were found in the south. Fumaria officinalis and Lamium spp. were found only in the south. The densities and dry weights of Lapsana communis, Myosotis arvensis, Polygonum aviculare, Tripleurospermum inodorum and Vicia spp. were higher in the south, while the densities and dry weights of Elymus repens, Persicaria spp. and Spergula arvensis were higher in the northwest. Total density of weeds did not differ between south and northwest (average = 565 vs. 570 shoots m(-2), respectively). Total dry weight of weeds was higher in the northwest compared with the south (average = 1594 vs. 697 kg ha(-1), respectively), mainly due to the high dry weight of E. repens. The only variable that was dependent on the duration of organic farming was weed density in the south. The abundance of nitrophilous in relation to non-nitrophilous weed species was higher while the abundance of perennial ruderal and grassland weed species was lower compared with previous weed surveys. This can be regarded as the result of increasing cropping intensity on organic farms in Finland. Different weed communities call for the application of specific target-oriented weed management in the respective coastal regions.

AB  - An ongoing loss of Europe's old-growth forests urgently calls for improving our understanding of native biodi-versity response to habitat changes. Studies disentangling the effects of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on species diversity are rare, however, understanding the differences between these effects is crucial for forest management and conservation efforts. Here, we investigated the influence of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on the total and red-listed species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) forest in Central Europe. The fruitbody-based mycological survey conducted on per-manent plots was combined with the measurements of forest structural characteristics such as deadwood vol-umes (indicating habitat quantity), dimensions, and decay stages (indicating habitat quality). Additionally, precise dendrochronological measurements were used to estimate the mean age of five oldest trees and the number of >250 years-old-trees (i.e., those that survived a probable logging activity about 250 years ago) as indicators of habitat continuity. Our results showed the total species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi to be best correlated with habitat quantity (volume of low snags and lying deadwood), while the red-listed species richness was best explained by habitat continuity indicated by the number of >250 years-old-trees. Our study provides novel evidence regarding uninterrupted habitat continuity being crucial in supporting red-listed fungal species. Stands with preserved habitat continuity (e.g., the absence of clearcutting and deforestation) as well as old-growth stands with long habitat history should be prioritised for conservation. Greater degree of retention forestry practices should be required in production forests to preserve habitat continuity. Our study shows that such decisions are likely to lead to positive effects that can persist for centuries.

AB  - Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity decline throughout Europe. Agri-environment schemes governed by EU regulation are a significant tool in combating this decline but despite high spending, experiences of their effectiveness have been mixed. Their effectiveness might be improved by targeting them to locations with high biodiversity value, and particularly by spatial coordination to enhance habitat connectivity and the associated ecological processes, such as dispersal. We show, with an example of semi-natural grassland conservation in South-Western Finland, how spatial conservation planning tools, here the Zonation software, could help in assessing the habitat connectivity and allocating management actions. We assign highest priority to sites that have been classified as nationally important and that have been under management, and let connectivity influence the Zonation prioritizations. According to Zonation outputs, 25-30% of highest-ranking grasslands in our study area are without management contracts, indicating weak connectivity of managed sites, whereas Natura 2000 areas are spatially better located. A 50% expansion of the current network would be adequate to bring its value close to that of a network created from scratch, but as the contracts are temporary, reallocation of the contracts from the least valuable, funded sites to more valuable, unfunded ones would be even more effective. Current policy instruments supporting farmland biodiversity are strongly constrained by EU regulation, and appear to be too inflexible to take the spatial differences in conservation values into account. Better communication and incentives to encourage farmer participation to these voluntary programs are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The developed REFUGE computer model is used to assess radiative forcing due to man-induced CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in Finland. Both the emission history and assumed future, control scenarios for emissions and forest carbon sink are considered. CO2 emissions from the use of the fossil fuels cause most of the radiative forcing due to human activities in Finland. Other important contributors to radiative forcing are N2O emissions from agriculture and transportation well as CH4 emissions from animal husbandry and waste disposal. Radiative forcing in the year 1990 due to the considered Finnish emissions is estimated to be approximately 3 mW/m2, which is approximately 0.15% of global radiative forcing (the population of Finland is - 0.09% of the Earth's population). Radiative forcing due to emissions resulting from human activities in Finland is increasing, and due to the slow change rates in emission producing activities and the slow removal of CO2 and N2O from the atmosphere, it seems unlikely that radiative forcing will be reduced in the next century to below the 1990 level using emission control. A remarkable additional measure in the control of radiative forcing due to activities in Finland might be to increase carbon storage in the forest ecosystem for some decades and to maintain this storage.

AB  - Forests are an essential component of the natural environment, as they support biodiversity, sequester carbon, and play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles-in addition to producing organic matter that is necessary for the function of terrestrial organisms. Forests today are subject to threats ranging from natural occurrences, such as lightning-ignited fires, storms, and some forms of pollution, to those caused by human beings, such as land-use conversion (deforestation or intensive agriculture). In recent years, threats from pests and pathogens, particularly non-native species, have intensified in forests. The damage, decline, and mortality caused by insects, fungi, pathogens, and combinations of pests can lead to sizable ecological, economic, and social losses. To combat forest pests and pathogens, biocontrol may be an effective alternative to chemical pesticides and fertilizers. This review of forest pests and potential adversaries in the natural world highlights microbial inoculants, as well as research efforts to further develop biological control agents against forest pests and pathogens. Recent studies have shown promising results for the application of microbial inoculants as preventive measures. Other studies suggest that these species have potential as fertilizers.

AB  - Quantification of suspended sediment yield from rivers is essential to determining how land cover and land use affect water quality in fluvial ecosystems and erosion rates in catchment basins. In this study we used long-term (1967-2011) river-runoff and sediment concentration data to seek new insights into suspended sediment transport and its governing factors. We found that long-term suspended sediment concentrations and yield of very fine sediment (< 0.4-1.2 mu m) are dependent on: (i) temporal changes in biogeochemical processes in catchment soils and fluvial systems, and (ii) temporal variations in metal humate colloid concentrations, especially in peat-covered catchments. The results also showed that the proportion of very fine sediment varies seasonally and can significantly affect transport rates in boreal rivers. Thus national monitoring activities should include parameters describing the quality of suspended sediment (e.g. particle size range and loss on-ignition) in order to provide information relevant to land management and ecological assessments in boreal rivers.

AB  - 1. Polyploidy is associated with a plethora of phenotypic and genetic changes yielding transformative effects on species' life-history and ecology. These biological attributes can contribute to the success of species on ecological timescales, as observed in the invasion success or rapid environmental and climatic adaptation of polyploids. However, to date there has been a distinct lack of empirical evidence linking species' local extinction risk, species distributions and community structure in fragmented landscapes with interspecific variation in ploidy.
   2. We aimed to investigate the relationship between levels of habitat fragmentation and patterns in both diversity and the frequency of species with different ploidy levels. We included additional persistence-and dispersal related life-history traits, to establish the relative importance of ploidy in determining species richness and frequencies following habitat fragmentation. We therefore collected plant community presence-absence data and landscape data from grassland fragments from south-central Sweden.
   3. Community-level analysis uncovered that interspecific variation in ploidy proved the strongest predictor of plant community species richness and turn-over across grassland fragments. Local extinction risk decreased as ploidy increased, with diploids most prone to local extinction.
   4. In the species-level analysis, ploidy outweighed the combined explanatory power of commonly used life-history traits such as clonality, dispersal mechanism and mating system; key predictors of plant species distributions across fragmented landscapes.
   5. Ploidy appears to capture parallel variation in a series of advantageous genetic and life-history mechanisms which operate on ecological timescales, emerging as the strongest predictor of local extinction risk even after accounting for variation in other crucial life-history traits. Our results therefore highlight the importance of genomic traits such as ploidy and total chromosome number as valuable factors explaining and predicting local extinction risk in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Globally expanding human land use sets constantly increasing pressure for maintenance of biological diversity and functioning ecosystems. To fight the decline of biological diversity, conservation science has broken ground with methods such as the operational model of systematic conservation planning (SCP), which focuses on design and on-the-ground implementation of conservation areas. The most commonly used method in SCP is reserve selection that focuses on the spatial design of reserve networks and their expansion. We expanded these methods by introducing another form of spatial allocation of conservation effort relevant for land-use zoning at the landscape scale that avoids negative ecological effects of human land use outside protected areas. We call our method inverse spatial conservation prioritization. It can be used to identify areas suitable for economic development while simultaneously limiting total ecological and environmental effects of that development at the landscape level by identifying areas with highest economic but lowest ecological value. Our method is not based on a priori targets, and as such it is applicable to cases where the effects of land use on, for example, individual species or ecosystem types are relatively small and would not lead to violation of regional or national conservation targets. We applied our method to land-use allocation to peat mining. Our method identified a combination of profitable production areas that provides the needed area for peat production while retaining most of the landscape-level ecological value of the ecosystem. The results of this inverse spatial conservation prioritization are being used in land-use zoning in the province of Central Finland.

AB  - Information on how birds use different types of habitat and move within landscapes is crucial for avian ecology, conservation and management. The Common Crane Grus grus has the widest distribution of all crane species and covers both increasing and decreasing populations. Ecological knowledge is therefore necessary both for conservation and to mitigate bird-human conflicts. We studied territory size and habitat selection of breeding Common Cranes (n=11) at two spatial scales in south-central Sweden by using VHF and UPS transmitters. Breeding families of Cranes were strongly associated with farmlands and wetlands independent of spatial scale. However, 41% of positions were within forested habitats. According to a compositional analysis, moist and wet forests were selected more frequently than dry forests. Territory size was on average 250 ha +/- 47.8 SE. The territories showed little overlap between neighboring breeding pairs. Our study provides information necessary for estimating densities of breeding pairs, but also to indicate habitat types worth special attention by landscape managers and conservationists.

AB  - Wind and bark beetle disturbances have increased in recent decades, affecting Europe's coniferous forests with particular severity. Management fostering forest diversity and resilience is deemed to effectively mitigate disturbance impacts, yet its efficiency and interaction with other disturbance management measures remain unclear. We focused on Central Europe, which has become one of the hotspots of recent disturbance changes. We used the iLand ecosystem model to understand the interplay between species composition of the forest, forest disturbance dynamics affected by climate change, and disturbance management. The tested measures included (a) active transformation of tree species composition toward site-matching species; (b) intensive removal of windfelled trees, which can support the buildup of bark beetle populations; and (c) reduction of mature and vulnerable trees on the landscape via modified harvesting regimes. We found that management systems aiming to sustain the dominance of Norway spruce in the forest are failing under climate change, and none of the measures applied could mitigate the disturbance impacts. Conversely, management systems fostering forest diversity substantially reduced the level of disturbance. Significant disturbance reduction has been achieved even without salvaging and rotation length reduction, which is beneficial for ecosystem recovery, carbon, and biodiversity. Synthesis and applications:We conclude that climate change amplifies the contrast in vulnerability of monospecific and species-diverse forests to wind and bark beetle disturbance. Whereas forests dominated by Norway spruce are not likely to be sustained in Central Europe under climate change, different management strategies can be applied in species-diverse forests to reach the desired control over the disturbance dynamic. Our findings justify some unrealistic expectations about the options to control disturbance dynamics under climate change and highlight the importance of management that fosters forest diversity.

AB  - In sustainable forest resource management, establishing forest conservation areas is important to maintain forest biodiversity. However, assessing the conservation value of forests is challenging because the target areas are often both large and remote. We explored using dense airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to estimate conser-vation values. Field data were collected at sites in Sweden for standing deadwood (S trees), laying deadwood (L trees), and trees considered particularly important for conserving biodiversity (N trees), and forest conservation values were determined using a commonly employed method in the field. A template matching method was then used to detect L, S and N trees from ALS data. L trees were identified from linear features in the point cloud above the ground, with a 52 % detection error rate. S and N trees were identified from unusually small or large crown diameters, with 71 % and 83 % error rates, respectively. We also tested the relationships between the three types of indicator tree, their summed values and the field inventory-assessed conservation values. Regressions between the assessed conservation values and ALS indicators were most robust comparing the three test sites when using the summed number of L, S, and N trees. A wall-to-wall map covering a 3 km x 4 km area was generated using Kernel density estimation of the summed number of ALS-derived indicators, to represent relative conservation values. The map was validated using 10 1-ha plots, and yielded an R2 value of 0.6 for predicted conservation values at the plot level. We conclude that ALS data can be used to map forest conservation values and inform decisions about which forests should be used for timber production and which should be set aside as conservation areas. The maps could also be used as a data source for habitat analysis.

AB  - We studied the immediate changes in pre-treatment coarse woody debris (CWD)(1) after retention felling and mechanical site preparation (scarification) in mature Picea abies-dominated boreal forest. Retention felling and scarification were hypothetised to affect the amount of CWD. The disturbance caused to CWD was assumed to depend on species and decay class. Logs were inventoried before fellings, after fellings, and after scarification, estimating the damage percentage for each log. After felling, 7.8% of the total pre-treatment volume of CWD was destroyed in the felled area. After scarification, the decline from pre-treatment volume was 67.6% in the felled area. The amount of CWD decreased also inside the retention tree groups; in the 1st post-treatment season, 4.6% was destroyed of the pre-treatment volume and 20% in the 2nd season. Of the retained trees, 40% were uprooted by the end of the 2nd season. If the majority of the initial downed CWD is destroyed by scarification, as our results show, we can estimate that since scarification became a widely used regeneration method in the 1960s, at least from 4 to 6 million m(3) of CWD has already been destroyed in Finland. The role of CWD as a key element for biodiversity in boreal forest is generally accepted, which has led to retention of trees in fellings instead of clear felling. We suggest that at least as important as leaving trees in order to maintain continuum in CWD and species diversity is to preserve existing CWD in fellings over the regeneration phase. This can be done using less destructive harvesting methods, reduced use of scarification and placing retention tree groups in patches with high amounts of CWD.

AB  - This study investigates the geochemistry of soft, organic-rich brackish-water surface sediments in the Archipelago Sea (SW Finland). The area is one of the world's largest archipelagos, and, although it is scarcely populated, frequent ship and boat traffic along with fish farming occurs. From 76 sites, 47 chemical elements were determined after aqua regia digestion. Other parameters determined were grain size, water, organic and nitrogen contents. At sampling, the sediments were visually classified into groups representing oxic, anoxic and fluctuating (intermediate) oxic seafloor conditions. The results show that the element concentrations are quite similar to other studies in the region but with clear signs of lower anthropogenic loading. Point source pollution was identified in one sample taken nearby a fish farm and a cable ferry. This site was strongly enriched in Cu, Zn and Sn derived from chemicals used in either, or both, activities at the site. Overall, the sediments can be divided into two groups that separate chemically and geographically. One group contains more fine-grained sediments that occur near shore, while the other group contains more anoxic, organic and sulfur-rich sediments occurring more offshore. The second group is interpreted to reflect material reworked from previous deposits as a result of shoaling of the area due to glacio-isostatic land uplift. The visual classes were included in both partial least squares regression (PLSR) and PLS discriminant analysis. These analyses showed that the oxic and anoxic seafloor sediments can be predicted from the chemical variables and grain-size distribution.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and capture have gained a central position in forest governance, alongside wood production and biodiversity conservation, resulting in calls for policy coherence and integration across the EU. While coherence is often a target in the technical assessment of the policy design, it is important to understand how incoherent policies are supported by disconnected or incongruent knowledge claims and epistemologies. We address the coherence of forest policy by analysing the content and knowledge claims in forest, bioeconomy, and biodiversity strategies of Finland, an EU member state in which forests have a strong economic, political, and cultural status. Focussing on the argumentation regarding forest carbon, our analysis shows that the policy domains remain largely disconnected and rely on differentiated knowledge bases. Despite the explicit claims about policy coherence, few genuine attempts have been made towards integration and coordination between the domains. Our analysis reveals the different logics with which climate change is to be governed, and the types of knowledge utilised and produced in the integration of forest carbon as a policy object. Our analysis suggests that policy strategies with sectoral foci facilitate incoherent policymaking due to unresolved trade-offs and knowledge disagreements. Knowledge used in the policy design and implementation processes should be discussed thoroughly, and thereby integrated.

AB  - The beaver (Castor fiber) was exterminated in Sweden, but now, after re-introduction, again occurrs in high densities. The activities of beaver - felling of trees and construction of dams - are important ecological factors in forest streams. The proportion of wetlands and open water in the forest landscape is increased, and new stream sections with slow-running water are created. This change of habitat characteristics is predicted to have consequences for the composition of stream fish communities. We studied the fish fauna in seven small to moderate-size streams with beaver in central Sweden, using electro-fishing. Beaver ponds and adjacent riffle sections were compared to unaffected reference sections. The two most common species were minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Three additional species occurred in lower numbers: Bullhead (Cottus gobio), burbot (Lota lota) and pike (Esox lucius). Brown trouts were more common in reference sections than in beaver-affected sections, while the opposite tended to be the case for minnows. The numbers of brown trouts and minnows in separate sections were negatively correlated. The size composition of the two species also differed between sections. Brown trouts captured in the ponds were larger than those in the riffle sections, while the opposite was true for the minnows. Shallow areas of the beaver ponds were important habitat for minnow fry. Beaver ponds are likely to serve as habitat for larger trouts in small streams during drought periods. Minnows appeared to spread from ponds to surrounding riffle areas. We conclude that beaver-mediated habitat changes have important effects on the relative abundance of fish species in Swedish forest streams, and that they may enhance fish species diversity.

AB  - Studies of spatial forest patterns have traditionally focused on habitat remnants within a landscape, but few have explicitly accounted for natural habitat patterns inherent to those landscapes. At broader scales, all cover types are to some degree subdivided. In boreal forest landscapes, forests, peat lands and water bodies form a variety of different spatial structures depending on their proportions and arrangement. To assess the spatial arrangement of forest patches relevant to organisms and ecological processes, we systematically sampled and analysed 57 boreal forest landscapes (10,000 ha in size) in central Finland. Our results show that even though forest is spatially very subdivided into discrete patches in boreal landscapes it becomes generally well-connected if narrow non-forested gaps are ignored. The proportion of forest cover varied from 17.8 to 75.3% and the number of discrete forest patches from 37 to 213. The average percolation threshold for forest cover was 46.8%. If a parts per thousand currency sign100 m wide non-forested gaps were ignored and forest patches were joined, the percolation threshold dropped to 33.3%. There were on average 13 discrete clusters of forest patches if forest patches within 200 m distance were combined. These results suggest that if a boreal forest species is able to cross even relatively narrow non-forested gaps, it is likely to perceive these boreal forest landscapes as continuous. Even though our present analysis was based on static forest cover patterns, it is important to consider landscape pattern domains when assessing habitat fragmentation and its consequences to populations of organisms.

AB  - Norway is among a handful of countries with an explicit policy to promote carbon capture and storage (CCS) at both national and international levels. This paper investigates the internal and external driving forces behind Norway's efforts to advance CCS as a global climate change mitigation option. The ambition is twofold: First, a mapping of Norway's public CCS policy with emphasis on the externally directed efforts is offered based on interviews and document studies. Second, it is explained how CCS foreign policy was chosen as a prioritized means of climate change mitigation policy in Norway. The study is conducted with the application of Foreign Policy Analysis. From the outside-in perspective, the international climate regime is emphasized. From the inside-out perspective, bureaucratic politics is in focus. It is found that the winning coalition behind the domestic CCS agenda also directed CCS foreign policy design and implementation. The CCS foreign policy offers a means to fulfil Norway's regime obligations on terms that harmonize the potential conflict of maintaining a political economy reliant on petroleum exports with a credible climate change mitigation policy. It is shown how technology R&D for global use has been a key ingredient in this context. It is also explored how the CCS foreign policy was materialized with the means of official development assistance and other funding mechanisms. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The chestnut (Castanea sativa) agro-ecosystem is of great social, economic and landscape importance in NE Portugal. There are multiple resources associated with this crop, among them fruit and wood production and mushroom harvesting. However, information about the diversity and ecology of macrofungi is very scarce. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the macrofungal diversity associated with chestnut trees over 4 y. Carpophore surveys were conducted in a non-tilled C. sativa orchard located in Braganca, Portugal, from Sep. 2002 to Dec. 2005. A total of 2677 carpophores belonging to 73 species across 16 families and 23 genera were recorded. Of the total number of macrofungal species listed, 82 % were ectomycorrhizal (EM) species. The genera with the greatest species richness were Russula, Inocybe and Lactarius, which accounted for 38.4% of all species collected. The most abundant species were Laccaria laccata, Hebeloma crustuliniforme and Inocybe geophylla, which produced around 35 % of all carpophores. The cumulative number of species over the four successive years revealed that 80.5 % of macrofungal species that potentially exist in the study area were surveyed. Species richness and carpophore abundance fluctuated across years, which could have been related to weather conditions, especially to rainfall. Fructification occurred in two distinct seasons a year, autumn and spring, the first one being the most important in terms of number of species and carpophores. These data could be an important contribution toward the development of sustainable management practices for chestnut agro-ecosystem conservation.

AB  - Naturally shed cones of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were placed on the forest floor, partly on moss-covered ground, and partly on vegetation-free needle mats. Numbered sticks allowed individual recovery after 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 years. During the first nine years, cones decomposed fastest in the moss site. After 13 years, dry weight loss was about 60% in both habitats, but cones still retained their shape. In the moss site, cones were then situated in the middle of the organic layer, with their underside about 3cm above the bleached layer. Cones in the needle mat profile had sunk less. One cone with rather intact shape was found below a nylon strip laid out 28 years earlier. Compared to needle litter from Norway spruce and Scots pine, spruce cones had low concentrations of Ca, Mn, and Fe. The concentration of these elements, as well as N, Al, and S, was greatly increased during decomposition. Ca, Mn, Fe, and Al were immobilized for a long time, as their total amount per cone increased with time. Cones decomposed slower than needles, so their role in humus composition and carbon storage may be greater than indicated by their fraction of fresh litter.

AB  - The effect of changes in roundwood harvests in Norway on the harvests in rest of the world is examined using a global forest sector model. About 60-100% of the harvest change in Norway is offset by an opposite change in the rest of the world. Such leakage rates vary over time, wood category, background scenario, and the size of the harvest change. Asymmetries between the effects of increasing and decreasing the harvests also exist. Hence, the magnitude of leakage rate is case specific, though considerable. Under tightening wood supply there is less need/room to respond to harvest increase/decrease in Norway with incremental/reduced harvests elsewhere. When the use of global forest resources intensifies with increasing wood demand in the future, leakage rates can be smaller than today. It is important to account for harvest leakage in order to avoid overestimating the climate benefits of policies that decrease or increase roundwood harvests. For instance, for full carbon sequestration benefits of increasing harvests for harvested wood products, creating fresh additional demand for these products should be prioritized. Else the origin of raw material and the place of production for these products may change instead of their stock.

AB  - Bumblebee communities and their foraging resources were surveyed in south Swedish agricultural landscapes of contrasting complexity, defined by the size of arable fields and the amount of permanent grazed pastures. After the flowering of oilseed rape (OSR), simplified landscapes contained substantially less herbaceous flower resources and a lower proportion of perennials, compared to complex ones. The seasonal pattern of bumblebee abundance differed between landscape types. Initial bumblebee abundances were equal in both landscape types. However, by late July there was a sharp decline of bumblebees in simple landscapes, while the abundance continued to increase in complex landscapes. This suggests that a larger proportion of bumblebee colonies may fail to reproduce in simple landscapes despite a beneficial early season. Overall, bumblebee abundance in late July was positively related to three inter-related variables: area of permanent pasture, area of ley fields and total amount of herbaceous flowers, while early abundances (June to early July) did not relate to these variables. We suggest that in simplified landscapes of this region, bumblebee abundance is limited by floral resources mainly from midsummer and onward. Spring and early summer resources may indeed be sufficient for colony establishment and initial growth even in simplified landscapes, possibly as a result of large scale farming of OSR. The initially equal abundances of workers in simple and complex landscapes, as well as the fact that also many of the regionally rare species seem to persist in simple landscapes, suggest that rare species can survive in pockets of beneficial habitat and/or there may be an inflow of queens from nearby complex landscapes. If the latter is true, further simplification or abandonment of complex landscapes may threaten bumblebee populations also in neighbouring simple landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. There is controversy over how the success of ecological restoration should be measured. Traditionally, emphasis has been placed on species diversity and other community attributes, whereas the restoration of ecosystem processes has received less attention. Here, we combine replicated field experiments and a field survey to provide an ecosystem-level measure of stream restoration success.
   2. Numerous headwater streams in Finland, and in many other parts of the world, have been channelized for timber transport, resulting in channels with simplified structure and flow. Recently, programmes have been launched to restore these streams to their pre-channelization condition. While the efficacy of restoration in improving fish habitat has been tested, little is known about effects on other stream biota or on the retention of leaf litter, despite its importance in trophic dynamics of forested headwater streams. Using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) designed experiment with multiple reference and experimental streams, we examined restoration-induced changes in retention efficiency by conducting leaf-release experiments before (1993) and after ( 1996) restoration.
   3. Substrate heterogeneity increased, but moss cover decreased dramatically following restoration. Retention efficiency in restored streams was higher than in channelized, but lower than in natural, streams. Algae-feeding scrapers were the only macro invertebrate group whose density increased significantly after restoration.
   4. Aquatic mosses were a key retentive feature in both channelized and natural streams, but their importance to retention was strikingly reduced by restoration. During restoration work. mosses are detached from large areas of the stream bed, exposing bare stone surfaces for colonization by periphytic algae.
   5. A more effective restoration technique would involve the use of moss transplants, or the addition of large woody debris, to increase retentiveness and thus enhance the availability of organic material to benthic consumers. This case study on rivers illustrates how restoration projects benefit from an ecosystem perspective and from measures of ecosystem processes in assessing restoration success.

AB  - The BIGCO2 R&D (BIGCO2) Platform is an international collaborative research project aiming at developing several enabling technologies and innovative solutions supporting a large-scale deployment of CO2 capture from power generation and underground storage of CO2. All main routes for CO2 capture are investigated. The project is coordinated by SINTEF Energy Research and the budget of the current project period (2007-2011) is 16 M(sic).
   BIGCO2 builds knowledge and technology underpinning demonstration of power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) at industrial scale. The project aims at closing critical knowledge gaps in the CO2 chain to enable sustainable power generation from fossil fuels based on carbon capture and underground storage of CO2. BIGCO2 is unique in terms size, diversity, and the fact that it comprises the whole CO2 chain. The project includes extensive international collaborative effort bringing together expertise and research infrastructure of competent research institutes and universities, supported by leading vendors, energy companies, and oil and gas companies.
   This paper presents the structure, the original objectives and the achievements of BIGCO2. Further, for each research task, the results are analyzed in light of the objectives. Each task leader has analyzed the results in the following context of: originally stated objectives, results, and if the results meet the objectives.
   The purpose of BIGCO2 is to develop new knowledge to enable power generation with CCS. Tangible objectives are: 90 % CO2 capture rate, 50% cost reduction, and a fuel-to-electricity penalty less than 7 % compared with state-of-the-art power generation. Partners of the Consortium are: Statoil, GE Global Research, Statkraft, Aker Clean Carbon, Shell, TOTAL, ConocoPhillips, ALSTOM, DLR, TUM, NTNU, CICERO, SINTEF Materials and Chemistry, SINTEF Petroleum Research, and SINTEF Energy Research. The University of Oslo is a subcontractor to the project. Further, BIGCO2 benefits from a strong collaboration between the combustion research facility at Sandia National Laboratories (USA) and SINTEF Energy Research. The main sponsor of BIGCO2 is the Research Council of Norway, with considerable co-funding from the industry partners and Gassnova.

AB  - Indonesia and Norway have entered into a landmark deal that will pay Indonesia up to US$1 billion for forest-conservation activities aimed at slowing rampant deforestation and resulting greenhouse gas emissions. A recent Presidential Instruction in Indonesia outlines a key deliverable of this "Partnership"-a two-year suspension on new concessions for clearing or logging of peat and old-growth forest. Here, we discuss the implications of this instruction for carbon and biodiversity protection. The protection of highly threatened deep peatlands represents a clear victory. However, by focusing solely on old-growth forests, the instruction excludes over 46 million ha of selectively logged rainforests, which often have high carbon storage and biodiversity. This leaves the logged forests, most of which are in accessible lowland areas, highly vulnerable to re-logging and conversion for oil palm and pulpwood plantations. The instruction also could allow large areas of peatlands and old-growth forest to be converted to sugarcane-one of the world's most rapidly expanding biofuel crops. While the Partnership could potentially help reform land-use planning and reduce illegal deforestation in Indonesia, we argue that Indonesia must also strive to protect vulnerable logged forests, which comprise a large part of the country's high-carbon, high-biodiversity lands.

AB  - Crossing disciplinary boundaries, particularly between social and ecological sciences, challenges those seeking to contribute to solving complex and multidimensional environmental problems on rangelands. In this Special Issue we present a set of 13 papers that to varying degrees attempt to integrate, or bring together, diverse approaches across disciplines to understand silvopastoral systems. The papers are about rangelands in numerous countries and regions, including Spain, Estonia, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Latin America, and Sweden. Silvopastoral systems provide ecosystem goods and services important to communities, cultures, and society. Management deliberately exploits the diversity fostered by rangeland systems that mix woody species with a well-developed herbaceous understory, offering a greater diversity of products, species, vegetation structural characteristics, and habitat components than either grassland or forest. Biodiversity often peaks at the intermediate levels of tree and shrub cover characteristic of silvopastoral systems. We introduce the papers grouped by four overarching topics: 1) typologies and scales, 2) social-ecological interactions, 3) integrated management, and 4) multiple knowledge systems. Unfortunately, silvopastoral systems often run afoul of ongoing intensification and simplification trends in agricultural production that reduce their economic and ecological resilience. Privately owned systems, the most common in this issue, are subject to the need for owner income. Finding ways to support the benefits of these systems for the public is difficult, as management traditions must be conserved as well as the land. We hope this issue illustrates the value of multifunctional systems and offers insights into how they work. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Fragmentation of terrestrial ecosystems has had detrimental effects on metapopulations of habitat specialists. Maculinea butterflies have been particularly affected because of their specialized lifecycles, requiring both specific food-plants and host-ants. However, the interaction between dispersal, effective population size, and long-term genetic erosion of these endangered butterflies remains unknown. Using non-destructive sampling, we investigated the genetic diversity of the last extant population of M. arion in Denmark, which experienced critically low numbers in the 1980s.
   Results: Using nine microsatellite markers, we show that the population is genetically impoverished compared to nearby populations in Sweden, but less so than monitoring programs suggested. Ten additional short repeat microsatellites were used to reconstruct changes in genetic diversity and population structure over the last 77 years from museum specimens. We also tested amplification efficiency in such historical samples as a function of repeat length and sample age. Low population numbers in the 1980s did not affect genetic diversity, but considerable turnover of alleles has characterized this population throughout the time-span of our analysis.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that M. arion is less sensitive to genetic erosion via population bottlenecks than previously thought, and that managing clusters of high quality habitat may be key for long-term conservation.

AB  - We investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) characteristics in three forests along a north-south transect in Sweden where these forest types cover about 69% of the landscape. There was variation in C-14 ages, and the median ages ranged from about 25 to > 2500 cal BP in SOC. Although total SOC and nitrogen (N) contents decreased, stable carbon isotope and humification indices increased with depth. These progressive changes with depth and age were related to degradation. The delta C-13 values and specific biomarkers indicated that organic carbon was primarily from C-3 plants. Biomarkers were effective in distinguishing OC input from specific sources (i.e. angiosperms, gymnosperms and grasses). A sharp decrease in biomarkers with depth indicated degradation of OC in the upper soil horizon, and limited contribution in the subsoil towards the stabilization of SOC. The sharp decrease in carbon stocks and C-14 age in the soil OC pool with increasing soil depth, and quite large values for the percentage of modern carbon, suggested a decrease in SOC pools. Overall, these results showed that carbon sequestration in high latitude forests was small, and their role as potential carbon sinks needs to be reassessed.

AB  - Wet grassland degradation is a global issue that involves both altered land cover patterns and ecological processes, which affect the distribution and abundance of species. The sharp decline in European wader bird (Charadrii) populations is a good example. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the anthropogenic developmental stage of wet grassland habitats and landscapes drives avian nest predator abundance, and thus the predation pressure on nests, which is a major cause of wader bird declines. Using a macroecological approach we selected six wet grassland landscapes representing a gradient in both grassland habitat development and breeding wader population status in four European countries (Belarus, Iceland, Lithuania and Sweden). We (1) mapped wader and avian predator assemblages in multiple wet grassland patches in each landscape, (2) used artificial nests to estimate the relative rate of egg predation, and (3) analyzed relationships between nest predation pressure, corvid nest predators versus raptors, nest loss and the stage of wet grassland habitat and landscape development. We found (1) inverse relationships between the abundance of corvids and waders, as well as between wet grassland developmental stage and waders, and (2) a positive correlation between the probability of nest loss and the density of corvid birds. In conclusion, we found a clear macroecological pattern linking habitat quality, wader populations, nest predators and nest predation. These linkages stress the importance of including nest predation as a factor limiting wader bird populations, and that corvid control or management may be useful management tools.

AB  - Droughts in recent years weaken the forest stands in Central Europe, where especially the spruce suffers from an increase in defoliation and mortality. Forest surveys monitor this trend based on sample trees at the local scale, whereas earth observation is able to provide area-wide information. With freely available cloud computing infrastructures such as Google Earth Engine, access to satellite data and high-performance computing resources has become straightforward. In this study, a simple approach for supporting the spruce monitoring by Sentinel-2 satellite data is developed. Based on forest statistics and the spruce NDVI cumulative distribution function of a reference year, a training data set is obtained to classify the satellite data of a target year. This provides insights into the changes in tree crown transparency levels. For the Northern Eifel region, Germany, the evaluation shows an increase in damaged trees from 2018 to 2020, which is in line with the forest inventory of North Rhine-Westphalia. An analysis of tree damages according to precipitation, land surface temperature, elevation, aspect, and slope provides insights into vulnerable spruce habitats of the region and enables to identify locations where the forest management may focus on a transformation from spruce monocultures to mixed forests with higher biodiversity and resilience to further changes in the climate system.

TI  - A pioneer country? A history of Norwegian climate politics
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
KW  - SCIENCE
KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The shift away from ecology towards climatology in Norwegian environmental policy in the late 1980s and 1990s was not accidental. A main mover was the Labor Party politician Gro Harlem Brundtland who did not want to deal with unruly and highly vocal Deep Ecologists. Better then to start afresh with a different set of environmental scholars appealing to the technocratic tradition within the Labor Party. Instead of changing the ethical and social ways of dealing with environmental problems as the Deep Ecologists were advocating, she was looking for technological and economic solutions. And she mobilized an international regime of carbon capture storage (CCS), tradable carbon emissions quota (TEQs), and clean development mechanisms (CDMs), all of which eventually were approved in Kyoto in 1997. This move towards technocracy and cost-benefit economics reflects a post-Cold War turn towards utilitarian capitalism, but also a longing to showcase Norway as an environmental pioneer country to the world. The underlying question was how to reconcile the nation's booming petroleum industry with reduction in climate gas emissions. Should the oil and gas stay underground and the country strive towards the ecologically informed zerogrowth society the Deep Ecologists were envisioning? Or could growth in the petroleum industry take place without harming the environment as the Labor Party environmentalists argued?
   The summer of 1989 was unusually hot in Norway and the sweltering heat wave provided ammunition for a parliamentary argument about global warming. The Prime Minister and the former Chair for the World Commission on Environment and Development, Gro Harlem Brundtland, pushed hard for an ambitious program aimed at stabilizing carbon emissions by the 1990s. Her goal was to prove to the world that Norway took Our Common Future (1987) and its quest for sustainable development seriously. For Brundtland, this was no minor topic. She was up for re-election that fall and for more than one-third of the Norwegian electorate, environmental concerns were the most important issue in deciding whom they would vote for (Aardal and Henry 1995, 19). Brundtland used environmental concerns to push her success in this realm, and sway voters to vote for her.
   But why global warming? This paper will examine Norwegian climate politics and policy in the late 1980s and 1990s, and attempt to explain the shift from a focus on ecology towards climate. In the late 1980s there were still valid scientific questions being raised in the scientific community with respect to the evidence provided by climatologists (Weart 2003; Fleming 2005; Edwards 2010). In addition, the Norwegian environmentalists, though concerned about global warming, were pushing politicians to address ecological depletion first. As will be argued, the political shift away from ecology towards climatology was not accidental. To Brundtland, the ecological approach meant having to negotiate with the unruly and highly vocal Deep Ecologists. She decided it was better then to start afresh with a different set of environmental scholars who would appeal to the technocratic and macroeconomic tradition of the Labor Party. Instead of changing the ethical and social ways of dealing with environmental problems as the Deep Ecologists were advocating, she was looking for technological and economic solutions. As a result, she mobilized an international regime of carbon capture storage (CCS), tradable carbon emissions quotas (TEQs), and clean development mechanisms (CDMs), all of which eventually were approved in Kyoto in 1997.
   This move towards technocracy and cost-benefit economics reflects a post-Cold War turn towards utilitarian capitalism, but also, as I will argue, a longing to showcase Norway as an environmental pioneer country to the world. The underlying question was how to reconcile the nation's booming petroleum industry with a reduction in climate gas emissions. Should the oil and gas stay underground and the country strive towards the ecologically informed zero-growth society the Deep Ecologists were envisioning? Or could growth in the petroleum industry take place without harming the environment as the Labor Party environmentalists argued?

AB  - 1. Moose is the most important game species in Sweden and the fall-out after the Chernobyl accident has severely affected hunting of this animal. Nine years after the accident many animals in areas that received high deposition still show activity concentrations that exceed the limit for human consumption. Whilst the mechanism for uptake of Cs-137 in animals is fairly well known, the extent of variability in diet composition in wild animals is still puzzling and our ability to predict future trends in activity concentration of radionuclides limited. Studies on moose since the Chernobyl accident reveal considerable variation in Cs-137-transfer between years and between individuals even in the same area. Differences in diet composition among individuals may explain the high degree of observed variability. Seventy per cent of the diet of moose in September is composed of Vaccinium myrtillus, Betula spp. and Salix spp. Significant differences between the proportion of birch and other components and species diversity within the diets among some years were measured.
   2. We used a simple model, applying Monte Carlo simulations to create artificial diets for Cs-137 intake in moose. The model suggests that changes of diet composition or habitat use are the main reasons for the large variation of Cs-137 observed in moose. The variability in activity concentrations between different years obscure the decline expected from physical decay. The model shows that the standard deviation of Cs-137 activity concentration in moose meat declines with time as differences in activity concentration between food plants diminish. The coefficient of variation varies considerably among years in the real population and the model suggests that even at comparatively low mean values a large variation between individuals is expected. The model predicts that even after 30 years, the half-life of Cs-137, a high mean level and a large variation could be possible.

AB  - The interest in harvesting logging residues in the form of stumps has recently increased markedly in the Nordic countries of Europe due to the steadily growing market for bio-fuel from forestry. Yet, stumps are currently harvested without a solid knowledge of their importance for forest organisms. To assess the relative importance of thinned, clear-cut, and burned clear-cut stands for the diversity of bryophytes on stumps we investigated bryophyte species composition and richness on 755 spruce stumps in 27 forest stands in southern-boreal Finland. Stumps were sampled within both wet and dry sites. For comparison we also surveyed bryophytes on 669 ground plots in the same stands to assess if patterns were consistent regardless of substrate type.
   Stand type (i.e. thinned, clear-cut, or burned clear-cut) was the main predictor of both species richness and composition on stumps. Stumps in thinned stands were more species rich than in clear-cuts, and the lowest richness was found on stumps in burned clear-cuts. Differences in species composition were explained by higher frequency of occurrence of species in thinned than in clear-cut stands. Thus, stumps in clear-cut stands tended to host a subset of species from the thinned stands, but there was also a pattern of turnover where different species were present in thinned and clear-cut stands, respectively. The results were similar for bryophytes on ground indicating that canopy cover strongly affected the diversity of bryophytes regardless of substrate.
   We conclude that stump harvest in open, clear-cut stands will probably have minor effects on bryophyte diversity on dead wood in the managed forest landscape. Conservation efforts in thinned stands (e.g. retention and creation of dead wood) may be important for promoting the diversity of bryophytes in managed forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change will bring about a consistent increase in temperatures. Annual precipitation rates are also expected to increase in boreal countries, but the seasonal distribution will be uneven, and several areas in the boreal zone will experience wetter winters and drier summers. This study uses the dynamic forest ecosystem model ForSAFE to estimate the combined effect of changes in temperature and precipitation on forest carbon stocks in Sweden. The model is used to simulate carbon stock changes in 544 productive forest sites from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. Forest carbon stocks under two alternative climate scenarios are compared to stocks under a hypothetical scenario of no climate change (baseline). Results show that lower water availability in the future can cause a significant reduction in tree carbon compared to a baseline scenario, particularly expressed in the southern and eastern parts of Sweden. In contrast, the north-western parts will experience an increase in tree carbon stocks. Results show also that summer precipitation is a better predictor of tree carbon reduction than annual precipitation. Finally, the change in soil carbon stock is less conspicuous than in tree carbon stock, showing no significant change in the north and a relatively small but consistent decline in the south. The study indicates that the prospect of higher water deficit caused by climate change cannot be ignored in future forest management planning.

AB  - Restoration of areas used for intensive even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) plantations often involves felling and subsequent spontaneous vegetation succession. However, the accumulated litter layer may hamper vegetation development, and thereby postpone recovery or even change the outcome.
   We studied effects of the litter layer on vegetation establishment during two seasons following a clear-cut of Norway spruce in Denmark. We experimentally assessed the response of multiple vegetation properties to litter removal, with and without wildlife exclusion by fencing, and in combination with sowing of trees, while fencing. Burning was tested as an alternative way to remove the litter layer.
   Vegetation establishment was poor, when the litter layer was intact, and cover developed slowly remaining below 10% after two years, irrespective of fencing. In contrast, litter removal and fencing together gave significantly faster recovery and reached nearly 60% mean cover. Vegetation cover was driven by few dominant species, especially the sedge Carex pilulifera. Species richness was similar in all treatments, but increased with sowing of trees. Fencing resulted in taller birch seedlings independently of litter removal, but enhanced by seedling density. Litter removal seemed to favor species with lighter seeds, lower specific leaf area (SLA) and lower Ellenberg N value, i.e. associated with relative infertile conditions. Disturbing the litter by burning seemed to have an effect comparable to mechanical removal, and could be a management alternative.
   Our results showed that a persistent litter layer after spruce plantation removal may hamper the initial vegetation establishment. Actively removing litter may serve as an additional restoration intervention to overcome this legacy. However, as grazing can keep this potential in check, wildlife exclusion may be necessary as well. To speed up recovery and diversify vegetation structure after spruce plantation removal, we suggest patchy disturbance of the litter, essentially combined with wildlife exclusion.

AB  - Over the last few centuries., several Ponto-Caspian tubificid oligochaetes have gradually dispersed from the Black Sea - Caspian Sea region to the north-west and west over Europe. The present world distribution comprising also the Great Lakes of North America clearly demonstrates that anthropochorous vectors of dispersal are involved. Passive transportation in the ballast water of ships has radically changed the possibilities of dispersal for many invertebrate species and has even made dispersal between continents possible. The construction of navigable canals has furthermore facilitated the crossing of watersheds and continents. Other likely vectors of longway dispersal for oligochaetes, as well as for other small-size aquatic invertebrates, are birds and mammals. The dispersal of the Potamothrix species is likely to have taken place in successive waves (three) with front-lines still on the move from the east to the west over the Baltic States and Scandinavia. The rheophilous species Potamothrix moldaviensis has presently reached - apart from the large rivers of Russia and many Central-European water bodies - also the Baltic States and south-eastern Sweden. Trajectories of dispersal demonstrate routes across the Baltic Sea - via the ballast water of ships. In the largest rivers of the Eastern Baltic Region (Neva, Daugava, Nemunas), downstream dispersal is the most likely way of transportation. P. moldaviensis together with P. heuscheri (second wave) and P. vejdovskyi (third wave) are presently forming front-lines running obliquely from the north-east to the south-west over south Sweden. In mesotrophic-eutrophic basins of eastern Lake Malaren, the abundance as well as the species diversity of oligochaetes is particularly high wherever Ponto-Caspian Potamothrix species - often several species together are involved.

AB  - Laura Banos-Picon, Josep D. Asis, Severiano F. Gayubo, and Jose Tormos (2009) Analyzing insect community structure through the application of taxonomic distinctness measures. Zoological Studies 48(3): 298-314. Taxonomic distinctness measures were initially developed as a way to assess aspects related to taxonomic and functional differences among species forming communities which are not usually taken into account in biodiversity analyses. In the present work, a comparative analysis aimed at evaluating the behavior and properties of these indices was performed, using communities of Spheciform wasps from different zones of the Iberian Peninsula. Samples were obtained using 2 different sampling techniques: malaise traps and hand nets. By analyzing the behavior of different classic indices of diversity and the taxonomic distinctness measures (average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+) and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Delta+)), it was found that the 2 methods of capture did not seem to provide the same type of information regarding the community structure, i.e., the use of hand nets revealed greater phylogenetic variability, while specimens captured with malaise traps were more uniform. Communities belonging to different biotopes, which had not experienced perturbation, were compared. Indices proved to be robust in terms of changes. Likewise, when assessing their independence with respect to sample size, both indices reached similar mean values, even though their sampling sizes showed noteworthy differences. Mean values of Delta+ and Delta+ of the communities analyzed in the study did not significantly differ with those obtained by a simulation, regardless of the type of habitat or sample size; this is consistent with the good state of the communities analyzed. Only the sampling method employed seems to influence Delta+. However, the classic estimators of diversity (richness and heterogeneity indices) were affected by the sample size and, to a lesser degree, by the type of sampling method used. Although their ecological interpretation remains unclear, taxonomic distinctness measures can offer a useful tool for studying and comparing insect communities. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.3/298.pdf

AB  - Semi-natural pastures have rich plant and animal communities of high conservation value which depend on extensive management. As the area of such land decreases, abandoned semi-natural grasslands have been restored to re-establish biodiversity. Restoration schemes, which include thinning of woody plants and reintroduction of grazing, are mainly designed according to the responses of well-studied groups (such as vascular plants and birds). Weevils (Curculionidae) are a very diverse phytophagous beetle family. Here, we evaluated the restoration success of pastures for weevils (Curculionidae), by comparing their species diversity in abandoned, restored, and continuously grazed semi-natural pastures on 24 sites in central Sweden. Weevils were sampled by sweep-netting. We recorded 3019 weevil individuals belonging to 104 species. There was no statistically significant difference in species numbers between the pasture management treatments. However, weevil species composition of abandoned pastures differed from those in restored and continuously managed pastures, but there was no significant difference in community composition between restored and continuously grazed pastures. The abandoned sites tended to be dominated by polyphagous species, whereas the grazed sites contained more monophagous and oligophagous species. The number of weevil species was positively related to understory vegetation height and connectivity to other semi-natural grasslands and negatively related to the cover of trees and shrubs in the pastures. We conclude that restoration of abandoned semi-natural pastures is a good approach to restore weevil communities. To maintain a species rich weevil community, pastures should be managed to be relatively open, but still have patches of tall field-layer vegetation. Restoration and conservation measures should primarily be targeted on regions and landscapes where a high proportion of semi-natural grassland still remains.

AB  - Disturbance history of an old-growth subalpine fir (Abies fargesii) forest in the Shennongjia Mountains of central China was reconstructed using dendroecological methods. Increment cores were extracted from 468 trees within six 100 m x 50 m permanent transects distributed across the old-growth subalpine fir forest of 300 ha. Growth patterns of 299 fir cores were examined for abrupt increases in radial growth to indicate formation of past canopy gaps and for rapid early radial growth to indicate establishment in past canopy gaps. The results showed that 70.8 % of the canopy fir trees experienced an average of 0.78 (ranging from 0 to 2) major release event for an average of 15.8 (ranging from 10 to 24) years, and an average of 1.94 (ranging from 0 to 3) moderate release events for an average of 25.6 (ranging from 10 to 36) years before they reached canopy. Recruitment pulse of trees coincided temporally with the peak of disturbance rate from the 1900s to the 1910s, suggesting occurrence of intense disturbance events during the time period. Radial growth analyses indicated that a history with small-scale disturbance events has resulted in the formation of the old-growth subalpine fir forest, and stand-replacing disturbances might not be necessary for the development of the forest. This study provides strong evidence that there are substantial variations in the disturbance severity and frequency over time. Most disturbance events might rather cause treefall gaps than clear large areas of forest at once. Thus, the old-growth subalpine fir forest experienced frequent gap-scale disturbances and few large-scale disturbances in its development history.

AB  - We investigated oribatid mite community diversity and structure in the managed conversion of coniferous stands into semi-natural montane forests that are composed of a small-scale mosaic formed by different age classes of silver fir, Norway spruce and European beech in the southern Black Forest area, South-Western Germany, using the space-for-time substitution method. The core hypothesis was that changing tree composition and management practice will affect functional structure and diversity of oribatid mite community through changing substrate quality and litter diversity. Three forest districts were selected within the research region. Four stand types representing the major stages of forest conversion were selected within each forest district: (i) even-aged spruce monocultures, (ii) species enrichment stage, (iii) forest stand structuring stage, at which fur and beech and other deciduous trees penetrate the upper storey of the forest and (iv) a diverse continuous cover forest respectively. Oribatid mite abundance, species richness and composition, biomass, ecomorphs and feeding groups relative abundance were determined. An overall increase in species richness moving from the spruce monoculture to a continuous cover forest was detected. However, the herbivorous and litter-dwelling mites were most sensitive to forest conversion demonstrating significant differences in abundance between conversion stages. Almost all changes in the oribatid community were associated with the properties of the changing litter layer. Abundance of soil-dwelling mites remained very stable what is in contradiction with the response of the other soil fauna groups found at the same sites. Overall oribatid community seemed to be more dependent on total microbial biomass than fungi. However, observed effects were overshadowed by considerable district-induced differences.

AB  - Invertebrates from eskers situated in bedrock areas were extracted from the groundwater by sieving water pumped from monitoring wells. Water quality was determined from water samples taken concurrently. The numbers of animals were small if compared with other studies from more southern parts of Europe. The animals were concentrated in the uppermost layer close to the groundwater table, which was situated at an average depth of 4 m from the ground surface. In the uppermost layer, the total numbers exceeded 10 ind. m(-3) at only a few sites. The deepest occurrence of animals was at 10-12 m below the ground surface. The most abundant taxa were the harpacticoids Bryocamptus minutus and Parastenocaris phyllura followed by nematodes and the lumbriculid oligochaetes Lamprodrilus isoporus and Stylodrilus heringianus. Both lumbriculids were shrunken in size. The next most abundant taxa were Diacyclops spp., turbellarians, Moraria brevipes and larvae of chironomids. The archiannelid Troglochaetus beranecki was found at several sites. Other species found were e.g. Aeolosoma hemprichi, Bryocamptus pygmaeus, Attheyella crassa, Parastenocaris glacialis and Paracyclops fimbriatus. The abundance of animals and the number of taxa were lower when the water table was situated deeper. Anthropogenic changes increased the number of both individuals and of taxa. B. minutus had the highest number of significant correlations with the water quality variables while the electrical conductivity had the highest number of correlations with the meiofauna parameters. Diversity increased with the size of pore space. Gravel extraction seemed to increase the numbers of individuals. The species diversity was high at an artificial groundwater plant having an induced infiltration. Road de-icing did not have a severe negative influence and oxygen was not a limiting factor. Food descending from the ground surface with percolating water appears to be rapidly utilized by meiofauna.

AB  - Measures of functional diversity are expected to predict community responses to land use and environmental change because, in contrast to taxonomic diversity, it is based on species traits rather than their identity. Here, we investigated the impact of landscape homogenisation on plants, butterflies and birds in terms of the proportion of arable field cover in southern Finland at local (0.25 km(2)) and regional (> 10 000 km(2)) scales using four functional diversity indices: functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence and functional dispersion. No uniform response in functional diversity across taxa or scales was found. However, in all cases where we found a relationship between increasing arable field cover and any index of functional diversity, this relationship was negative. Butterfly functional richness decreased with increasing arable field cover, as did butterfly and bird functional evenness. For butterfly functional evenness, this was only evident in the most homogeneous regions. Butterfly and bird functional dispersion decreased in homogeneous regions regardless of the proportion of arable field cover locally. No effect of landscape heterogeneity on plant functional diversity was found at any spatial scale, but plant species richness decreased locally with increasing arable field cover. Overall, species richness responded more consistently to landscape homogenisation than did the functional diversity indices, with both positive and negative effects across species groups. Functional diversity indices are in theory valuable instruments for assessing effects of land use scenarios on ecosystem functioning. However, the applicability of empirical data requires deeper understanding of which traits reliably capture species' vulnerability to environmental factors and of the ecological interpretation of the functional diversity indices. Our study provides novel insights into how the functional diversity of communities changes in response to agriculturally derived landscape homogenisation; however, the low explanatory power of the functional diversity indices hampers the ability to reliably anticipate impacts on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Global forests are the main component of the land carbon sink, which acts as a partial buffer to CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Dynamic vegetation models offer an approach to projecting the development of forest carbon sink capacity in a future climate. Forest management capabilities are important to include in dynamic vegetation models to account for the effects of age and species structure and wood harvest on carbon stocks and carbon storage potential. This article describes the implementation of a forest management module containing even-age and clear-cut and uneven-age and continuous-cover management alternatives in the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Different age and species structure initialisation strategies and harvest alternatives are introduced. The model is applied at stand and European scales. Different management alternatives are applied in simulations of European beech (Fagus sylvaticus) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) even-aged monoculture stands in central Europe and evaluated against above-ground standing stem volume and harvested volume data from long-term experimental plots. At the European scale, an automated thinning and clear-cut strategy is applied. Modelled carbon stocks and fluxes are evaluated against reported data at the continent and country levels. Including wood harvest in regrowth forests increases the simulated total European carbon sink by 32 % in 1991-2015 and improves the fit to the reported European carbon sink, growing stock, and net annual increment (NAI). Growing stock (156 m(3) ha(-1)) and NAI (5.4 m(3) ha(1) yr(1)) densities in 2010 are close to reported values, while the carbon sink density in 2000-2007 (0.085 kg C m(-2) yr(1)) equates to 63 % of reported values, most likely reflecting uncertainties in carbon fluxes from soil given the unaccounted for forest land-use history in the simulations. The fit of modelled and reported values for individual European countries varies, but NAI is generally closer to reported values when including wood harvest in simulations.

AB  - This study integrates an ecological process-based growth model, economic description of forestry and derivative-free numerical optimization for analysing optimal management of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) stands in fertile southern Finland sites. The process-based growth model is built on fundamental ecological theories of photosynthesis, tree structure and competition between trees. Because of the sound theoretical basis the validity of the optimization results is not restricted to a limited set of states determined by the boundaries of empirical data. The detailed structure of the growth model enables the inclusion of timber quality and its dependence on the size and quality of branches. The optimized variables include the initial stand density, the number, type and intensity of thinnings and the rotation period. The results yield a detailed and coherent picture of optimal stand level management. Comparing the optimal solutions with silvicultural practices suggests that the latter are based on unoptimal thinnings, too low stand density and too long rotation periods. As a consequence a fraction of harvested trees contain too large dry branches and qualify only as low value pulpwood implying that the bare land value remains below 60% of its maximized level.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a worldwide zoonosis, is highly prevalent in Africa particularly in northern and eastern Africa where data are more abundant than other regions. However, harmonization of available data through systematic review and meta-analysis may foster improved transboundary cooperation for the control of CE in Africa. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, research articles (from 2000 to 2019) were retrieved from ScienceDirect, PubMed, African Journals OnLine and Google Scholar databases. A total of 98 studies of 806,624 animals from 13 countries comprising 264,016 goats, 247,326 sheep, 251,106 cattle, 28,314 camels, 4,764 buffaloes, 2,920 equids, 1,966 pigs, 408 wild boars and 50 Norway rats were available for systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled prevalence including 5,048 dogs, 345 lions, 220 hyenas, 94 wolves and 47 jackals/foxes analysed for Echinococcus infection. In total, 46,869 animals were infected and pooled prevalence of CE in intermediate hosts was highest in camels (17.1%; 95% CI: 12.1-22.8) and lowest in pigs (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1-0.6). Results also showed uneven species/genotype distribution across the continent such that Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1, G3) constituted 74.45% of the total isolates from East Africa, E. canadensis (G6/7) accounted for 60.3% and 97.4% in North and West Africa, respectively, while 81.3% of E. ortleppi (G5) were recorded for southern Africa. The comparatively higher prevalence estimates for eastern and northern Africa than other regions indicate where efforts on CE management should now be given greater attention in Africa. Additionally, this study also advocates for better cooperation between countries within the same sub-region and the establishment of joint CE control programmes.

AB  - Harvest activity directly impacts timber supply, forest conditions, and carbon stock. Forecasts of the harvest activity have traditionally relied on the assumption that harvest is carried out according to forest management guidelines or to maximize forest value. However, these rules are, in practice, seldom applied systematically, which may result in large discrepancies between predicted and actual harvest in short-term forecasts. We present empirical harvest models that predict final felling and thinning based on forest attributes such as site index, stand age, volume, slope, and distance to road. The logistic regression models were developed and fit to Norwegian national forest inventory data and predict harvest with high discriminating power. The models were consistent with expected landowners behavior, that is, areas with high timber value and low harvest cost were more likely to be harvested. We illustrate how the harvest models can be used, in combination with a growth model, to develop a national business-as-usual scenario for forest carbon. The business-as-usual scenario shows a slight increase in national harvest levels and a decrease in carbon sequestration in living trees over the next decade.

AB  - The stock structure of turbot was investigated between samples from S-Norway, the Irish Sea and the Kattegat, using 12 microsatellite loci and compared to the turbot caught in Icelandic waters. Highly significant genetic differentiation was observed between samples from Kattegat and other areas. Significant genetic differentiation was also observed between the Irish Sea sample on one hand and Iceland and S-Norway on the other hand. No significant genetic differentiation was observed between Iceland and S-Norway. Otoliths of 25 turbot, age ranging from 3 to 19 years, were subjected to nearly 300 mass spectrometry determinations of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes. Oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) in the otolith samples was used to estimate ambient temperature at time of otolith accretion, and yielded estimated temperatures experienced by the turbot ranging from 3 to 15 C. Overall, the genetic analysis indicates panmixia between turbot in Icelandic and Norwegian waters. While the extensive migration of larvae between Norway and Iceland is unlikely, passive drift of turbot larva from other areas (e.g. Ireland) cannot be ruled out. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To balance conflicting demands for food and safety from predation, foraging individuals trade off time between feeding and safety by vigilant behavior. We studied the behavior of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and pine martens (Martes martes) scavenging at carcasses of moose (Alces alces) killed by wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden. Red foxes were observed visiting carcasses more often and at a higher frequency than pine martens, which restricted carcass use to certain habitats. Both species followed a similar daily and seasonal activity pattern. The seasonal peak of scavenging, in April for pine martens and April May for red foxes, showed that remains of wolf-killed prey are likely an important food source for both of these species during reproduction. Pine martens displayed an overall higher level of vigilance and a lower level of feeding than red foxes. Vigilance by pine martens was affected by habitat, visibility, and vegetative cover at carcass sites. Pine martens did not display increased vigilance during time periods of high red fox activity and there was no effect of the time of day. Our study showed support for the importance of interspecific predation risk leading smaller predators to trade off foraging for increased vigilance, but habitat characteristics affected vigilance patterns more than the mere presence of a larger predator.

AB  - Kelp forests are highly productive systems that are important ecologically and commercially as well as in a blue carbon perspective. Given their importance, there is an urgent need to achieve reliable estimates of the spatial distribution of their biomass. Species distribution modelling is a powerful tool for producing such estimates, but it requires a solid framework, including important environmental covariates that have a direct effect on their biomass, a proper sampling strategy, and an independent evaluation dataset. Using Laminaria hyperborea as a model species, we developed a modelling framework considering these requirements and necessary steps to produce reliable predictions. Our modelling framework included proportion of hard substrate and bottom wave exposure, both crucial covariates that have a direct effect on the biomass of L. hyperborea, but rarely included in modelling studies. Furthermore, we devised a sampling strategy with field observations covering the whole environmental covariate space present in the study area. Subsequently, we fitted GAMs relating the field observations of the biomass of L. hyperborea to relevant environmental covariates. The best model containing the predictors bottom wave exposure, depth, and proportion hard substrate explained most of the variance in the dataset (83.1% deviance explained). This model was then used to predict the spatial distribution of biomass across the whole study area. To assess the reliability of the biomass predictions, we used an independent dataset of L. hyperborea biomass observations from the same area. This independent dataset correlated very well with spatial predictions of biomass based on our best model (R = 0.85). In total, we predicted a biomass of 457,000 tonnes in a 1,150 km(2) study area on the West coast of Norway. Our modelling framework provides the means for developing a biomass model on a broader geographical scale. Such a model will be invaluable in improving kelp management regimes as well as for estimating the contribution of kelp forests to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and climate budgets.

AB  - Land-use related to technical infrastructure puts great pressure on nature and landscapes globally. We used a screening approach to evaluate vegetation development in 295 construction sites related to upkeeping of the national power grid in Norway and assessed if and how active measures for vegetation recovery can contribute to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity and natural carbon storage. Bayesian networks were developed to assess the effect of interventions on the vegetation cover, and an ensemble learning algorithm (Boruta) was used to assess variable importance. Multivariate analysis was run to investigate plant functional group composition. The screening approach uncovered some broad results; A large diversity of installation types are associated with gridline-systems, and the large variation of mitigation measures are hard to classify and evaluate. Years since restoration, region and site ID were important to explain the total vegetation cover, while restoration treatment, soil and installation type were not important. Graminoids dominate the total vegetation cover, in both seeded and non-seeded sites. More detailed studies will contribute to more accurate evaluation of different measures and vegetation recovery. Lack of documentation and well-designed monitoring hamper the development of reliable procedures of mitigation in construction projects, as the ecological outcome of the efforts can be questioned.

AB  - A mid-altitudinal peak in species richness is commonly observed and the mass effect (or source-sink effect) has been suggested as a possible cause. We test the importance of the mass effect for generating altitudinal patterns of plant species richness at two grain sizes using a simple estimate of sterility/fertility to indicate sinks and sources. To do this we identified species with fertile specimens (fertile species) and species with only sterile specimens (sterile species) in each sampling unit along altitudinal transects and assumed that the number of sterile species indicated the relative number of sink species, correspondingly that the number of fertile species indicated the relative number of source species when looking at the overall pattern of species richness along a transect. To evaluate this approach, we investigated the distribution of sterility and fertility of each species along the altitudinal transects. We found that sterile species are found more often at the edges and fertile species more often in the centre of the species altitudinal ranges than expected by chance. Using a fine grain, sterile species richness had a humped altitudinal pattern on all transects investigated at this scale, whereas using a coarse grain two of the three transects investigated had a humped pattern. At the fine grain, sterile species richness had a more pronounced peak than fertile species richness in two of the three transects investigated supporting the hypothesis of the mass effect, but this pattern did not persist at coarser grain. The observations at the fine grain are in accordance with the idea that the mass effect is important in shaping the mid-altitudinal peak in species richness, whereas the observations from the coarser grain are ambiguous.

AB  - The structure of forests is an important stabilizing factor regarding ongoing global climate and land use change. Biodiverse mountain forests with natural structure are one of the ecosystems most endangered by these problems. We focused on the mountain forest islands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and their role in the natural distribution of organisms. The study area was situated in the oldest Czech national park, Krkonose (385 km(2)), which is the highest mountain ridge in the country. We studied multi-taxa (lichens, beetles and hymenopterans) responses to three hierarchical spatial levels of the environment: the topography was described by the elevation gradient; the patch structure was described by canopy openness, dead wood amounts, and Norway spruce (Picea abies) cover; and the tree level was described by species of the sampled tree and its diameter. Lichens preferred higher elevations, while insect groups responded conversely. Furthermore, insect groups were mainly influenced by the inner patch structure of beech islands. Lichens may be jeopardized due to the predicted future increase in temperatures, since they would need to shift toward higher altitudes. Insects may be mainly threatened in the future by land use changes (i.e., forest management) - as indicated by an interconnection of canopy openness and the amount of dead wood.

AB  - Landscapes composed of agricultural land mixed with forest are desirable since they provide a wide range of diversified ecosystem services, unlike specialized agricultural landscapes, but that creates a trade-off between these land uses since wildlife usually feed on crops and reduce yields. In Nordic countries, where human population density is low and game hunting can be a viable economic alternative, mixed landscape systems are particularly interesting. To evaluate the economic sustainability of such systems we need to quantify wildlife damage to crops. One important species, being popular among Swedish hunters and therefore economically valuable, is fallow deer (Dama dama). Our objective was to evaluate the economic sustainability of mixed landscape systems including cultivated fields and commercial hunting of fallow deer. We studied the effects of excluding fallow deer by using 86 exclosures and adjacent plots in winter wheat and oat fields in south-west Sweden. We analyzed yield losses and interactions between spatial and temporal grazing patterns, anthropogenic landscape features, and topological characteristics of the landscape. We found that animals avoided exposed spots, irrespective of distance from human activity. We also found a seasonal grazing pattern related to the different growing periods of winter wheat (more grazed, emerging in autumn) and spring oat (less grazed, emerging in spring). We then compared the costs of crop damage against the commercial value of fallow deer hunting. The damage amounted to 375 +/- 196 is an element of ha(-1) for wheat and 152 +/- 138 is an element of ha(-1) for oat, corresponding to a total cost per animal of 82.7 +/- 81.0 is an element of, while each animal had an estimated market value of approximately 100 is an element of. Therefore the value of fallow deer presence compensated for the associated cost of crop damage. Profit could be further improved in this case by adopting additional management strategies. In general our study confirmed the economic feasibility of this particular mixed land management.

AB  - In the Arctic, environmental conflicts over land use and the exploitation of natural resources cast shadows over communities. Artists' and art educators' responses can play a meaningful role in resisting harmful developments. Emerging artistic and pedagogical interventions follow principles of socially and environmentally engaged art and art education. This visual essay describes a contemporary art event that opposed plans for an iron ore mine next to Pallas-Yllastunturi National Park in Finnish Lapland. An art-based action-research strategy was used to develop resources for communities in conflict. It focuses on describing the cyclical nature of art interventions. Analyses of activities show that art-based resources in environmental battles can foster cultural resilience, impact values, enhance hope and allow for campaigning that uses art to communicate environmental concerns. Further research into artistic interventions that open dialogue between parties in conflict is required.

AB  - Restoration of boreal coniferous forests is used in Northern Europe to increase the natural variability of forest structure and to add coarse woody debris for red-listed dead-wood dependent species, mainly insects and fungi. In four protection areas of eastern Finland, we evaluated how three commonly used restoration methods (felling with chainsaw, storm simulation, and felling with burning) with two felling levels (20% and 40% of initial living stand volume) affect the vegetation dynamics. The aim was to assess whether the type and intensity of restoration lead to different stages in the plant succession which would reflect the effectiveness of the restoration methods in terms of simulating natural disturbances. The restoration treatments were conducted in 2006 on 43 experimental stands and 15 were set as controls. Understory vegetation cover was surveyed from 372 permanent 1 m(2) plots in 2005, 2007 and 2011. The data were analyzed with mixed effect models and multivariate methods. Burning most efficiently initiated natural vegetation succession. Despite the initial decline of nearly all plant functional types, pioneering species such as Betula spp. and Populus tremula, forbs, graminoids and pioneer mosses regenerated quickly and exceeded their pre-disturbance covers in 2011. Dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea and Calluna vulgaris recovered nearly to their initial levels, whereas Empetrum nigrum, forest mosses and lichens did not show any recovery in five years. Storm simulation increased species richness on the stand scale and promoted the regeneration of Pinus sylvestris in soil exposed by tree uprooting. Tree felling slightly decreased the cover of lichens on the lower felling level treatment. We generated a species response table illustrating the responses of dominant species to restoration methods in the course of the seven-year study. We conclude that the dominant restoration method, tree felling, could increasingly be replaced by burning and storm simulation which have faster and greater positive impacts on the forest ecosystem.

AB  - Standing dead trees (snags) play important roles in forest ecology by storing carbon as well as providing habitats for many species. Moreover, snags preserved for hundreds of years can provide useful data to extend tree-ring chronologies used for climatological and ecological studies beyond the lifespans of living trees. Here we examined the growth patterns of Scots pine snags from the central Scandinavian Mountains, in relation to still living trees. Using changes point analyses, we showed that a majority (74%) of the snags displayed significant negative growth changes prior (on average 17 years) to death. Change points around the same years were also seen in living trees, but they recovered their growth. The average growth reduction of snags showing negative growth changes before death was 46%. In most cases the final growth change points coincided with very cold summers, or to a lesser degree to period of cool summers. It was suggested that pines ending up as snags were less resilient than the trees which continued living, and thus not able to recover after cold summer events. Since the snag growth reductions prior to death were partly unrelated to climate, care should be taken when using such data in dendroclimatological studies.

AB  - In Scandinavian forestry, prescribed burning is carried out to promote biodiversity. This study was initiated to examine how burning of a clear-felled area affected the soil and soil-solution chemistry in a nitrogen-limited coniferous forest in boreal Sweden. The stand was clear-felled and the logging residues were left on site. The harvested area was divided into two parts: one part was burnt within three months after clear-felling while the other part was left as a control. Soil and soil-solution samples were collected before and after felling and burning. In the FH layer, pH and the concentration of K and P tended to increase immediately after burning. Six years later, only small effects on soil chemistry were indicated, but the N concentration in the FH layer appeared lower in the burnt area even after 11 years. In the deep soil solution, the total organic carbon concentration was lower in the burnt area than in the unburnt area. The NO3--N concentration in the burnt area peaked at 0.50 mg l(-1) and the mean concentration during the first seven seasons was 0.13 mg l(-1). In the unburnt area, the NO3--N concentration peaked at 3.1 mg l(-1) and the corresponding mean concentration was 1.0 mg l(-1). Although the general level of NO3--N was low in this study, burning largely counteracted the increase in NO3--N concentration that usually follows final felling.

AB  - In this work, we studied the potentials offered by managed boreal forests and forestry to mitigate the climate change using forest-based materials and energy in substituting fossil-based materials (concrete and plastic) and energy (coal and oil). For this purpose, we calculated the net climate impacts (radiative forcing) of forest biomass production and utilization in the managed Finnish boreal forests (60 degrees-70 degrees N) over a 90-year period based on integrated use forest ecosystem model simulations (on carbon sequestration and biomass production of forests) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) tool. When studying the effects of management on the radiative forcing in a system integrating the carbon sink/sources dynamics in both biosystem and technosystem, the current forest management (baseline management) was used a reference management. Our results showed that the use of forest-based materials and energy in substituting fossil-based materials and energy would provide an effective option for mitigating climate change. The negative climate impacts could be further decreased by maintaining forest stocking higher over the rotation compared to the baseline management and by harvesting stumps and coarse roots in addition to logging residues in the final felling. However, the climate impacts varied substantially over time depending on the prevailing forest structure and biomass assortment (timber, energy biomass) used in substitution.

AB  - Forest fragmentation increases the amount of edge habitats in landscape. Despite the profound ecological influences that edges may have, the patterns and processes of edge formation have largely remained unexplored. The aim of this study was to find answers to three questions: (1) How have the landscape structure and composition, as measured by different successional stages, changed over a period of about 50 years in forested landscapes in southern Finland? (2) What are the differences in the amount of edge and interior habitat between successive years? (3) How does the forest ownership, state or private, affect the prevalence of edges? Digitized aerial photographs taken in 1941 and 1944 (period 1), 1969 (period 2) and 1997 (period 3) were used to study the prevalence of different successional stages, area of interior mature forest and edge habitats in two nearby 10 km(2) forest areas with private and state ownership, respectively. The forest composition was similar in the two forest areas, with mature forests being replaced by younger development stages. The area of interior mature forest decreased dramatically from period 1 to period 2. Assuming an edge width of 100 m, the proportion of edge habitat increased from 30% to 61% in the state forest and from 26% to 76% in private forest. The detected changes and their possible consequences to species suggest that management of different types of edges and converging edges should receive considerable attention in the future.

AB  - Temporal trends in inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) export in the stream water between 1979 and 2006 were studied in eight forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air-temperature trend and a decreasing N-deposition trend has been observed since the 1980s. The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to study if the stream water N concentrations have changed concurrently and a mixed model regression analysis was used to study which catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables were related to the variation in stream water N. The annual concentrations of total organic N (TON) increased at two catchments and the concentrations of nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) decreased at three and four catchments, respectively. The main factor explaining variation in concentrations and export of N was percentage of peatlands in a catchment. The NH4-N concentrations were also related to the N deposition, and the exports of NO3, NH4, and TON to precipitation. Quantitative changes in both the N concentrations and exports were small. The results suggested relatively small changes in the N concentrations and exports between 1979 and 2006, most probably because the effects of increased air and stream water temperatures largely have been concealed behind the concurrent decrease in N deposition.

AB  - Aspen has a high conservation value and has been targeted as a priority species in sustainable forest management. However, sustained and intense browsing pressure by ungulates has raised concerns about the recruitment of aspen to mature growth stages. Here we investigate the influence of ungulate browsing on the demographic structure of European aspen populations in two managed boreal forest areas in Sweden with contrasting amounts of aspen and high densities of ungulates. The contrast in size distribution of ramets in the two areas was striking. The aspen-poor environment contained a much lower density of small-sized ramets than the aspen-rich environment. Ramet abundance was strongly associated with the abundance of ramets in the smaller size classes in both areas, reflecting demographic inertia in these populations. Ungulate use was most strongly associated with abundance of medium-sized aspen saplings growing in forest interiors. Otherwise, use of ungulates was only weakly correlated with aspen population parameters. The strong demographic momentum exhibited by these populations suggests that aspen conservation and management should pay more attention to additional factors than browsing to promote ramet establishment. Large variation in abundance of ramets in the smallest size-class shows that some aspen stands have a disproportionate effect on aspen recruitment, particularly in areas where aspen is less abundant. identifying aspen stands with a large capacity for self regeneration may be the key to meet aspen conservation goals.

AB  - Forest stand biomass or carbon storage in the biomass may be estimated by conversion,of the trees volume since roughly 50% of tree biomass is carbon. There is a need to find biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEFs) for young stands, because those established for older ones may not be relevant due to changes in biomass allocation patterns over stand age and development phases. We developed BCEF5 for above- and belowground biomass components of young silver birch stands as separate functions of stand age or variables that reflect growth conditions and the biological status of trees, i.e. top height (H-100), mean height (H-g), base diameter (D-0), quadratic mean diameter at breast height (D-g) or stand volume (V). Data were collected on 120 pure birch stands that regenerated naturally on post-agricultural lands in Poland. We determined BCEF5 based on the stem volume and dry biomass of above- and belowground components. We applied segmented linear regression (SLR) to develop equations for BCEF determination for each of the pre-determined age classes using (a) fixed break points (FBP) found with the Ward method and (b) estimated break points (EBP) derived based on the best fit of regression models during piecewise regression estimation. We found that the use of SLR and non-linear regression (NR) approaches produced similar results in terms of quality of fit. However, non-linear parameter estimates are more efficient than linear ones, as NR seems to be more frequently used and easier to process using existing statistical tools, but at the same time the SLR provides biological interpretation of results (i.e. the point where BCEF value stabilizes and beyond which stand features do not influence BCEF). The largest difference between EBP and FBP occurs for stems, and the smallest for roots. For total biomass and all biomass components except stem, BCEFs are very high for the youngest, shortest and thinnest trees and hence stands with low volume. Their values decrease along with age, height, diameter and volume towards the EBPs. For individuals older, taller, thicker and with higher volume than EBP, there is no influence of age, H-100, H-g, D-0, D-g and V on BCEF values. We confirmed that H-100 might be a good biomass predictor for young birch stands, which is important because measuring tree height is not as time consuming as tree diameter measurements, particularly for young and very dense stands, and this parameter can be obtained from remote sensing technology.

AB  - The current requirements to decrease the consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuels have increased the demand of renewable energy sources. In forestry, this situation has intensified harvesting practices resulting in a decreased amount of woody debris left on the clear-cut areas. Impacts of energy wood harvest on wood-decomposing fungi were studied in a large-scale experiment in clear-cut stands in three geographical areas in Finland. A sequence of treatments was expected to form a forestry induced soil disturbance gradient: (1) logging residues left at site, no soil preparation; (2) logging residues left at site, patch mounding; (3) 70% logging residue removal, patch mounding; and (4) complete stump and logging residue removal, patch mounding. Pre-weighed wood discs were incubated on the intact soil cover for four years to estimate decomposition rate and fungal decomposer community. A soil sample was taken underneath each disc to evaluate the direct inoculation potential of the soil. The main results were as follows: (1) The differences between the treatments were not significant, while the geographical factors affected the decomposition rate and the fungal communities of the wood discs. (2) The fungal composition in the wood discs did not reflect the underlying soil fungal community, which indicates that a part of the fungal species inhabiting wood discs originated from airborne surrounding sources. (3) The increase in fungal species diversity was associated to the wood decay process, indicated by parallel increase in the wood decomposition rate and the number of white rot and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus our study indicates that in addition to local environment, landscape-level factors control the decomposer fungal community and its activity in wood.

AB  - Biological invasions cause major ecological and economic costs in invaded habitats. The round goby Neogobius melanostomus is a successful invasive species and a major threat to the biodiversity and ecological function of the Baltic Sea. It is native to the Ponto-Caspian region and has, via ballast water transport of ships, invaded the Gulf of Gdansk in Poland. Since 1990, it has spread as far north as Raahe in Northern Finland (64 degrees 41'04"N, 24 degrees 28'44"E). Over the past decade, consistent individual differences of behavioral expressions have been shown to explain various ecological processes such as dispersal, survival or reproduction. We have previously shown that new and old populations differ in personality trait expression. Individuals in new populations are bolder, less sociable and more active than in old populations. Here we investigate if the behavioral differentiation can be explained by phenotype-dependent dispersal. This was investigated by measuring activity, boldness and sociability of individually marked gobies, and subsequently allowing them to disperse in a system composed of five consecutive tanks connected by tubes. Individual dispersal tendency and distance was measured. Our results revealed that in newly established populations, more active individuals disperse sooner and that latency of a group to disperse depends on the mean sociability of the group. This indicates the presence of personality dependent dispersal in this species and that it is maintained at the invasion front but lost as the populations get older.

AB  - This article discusses how studying rhythms can help us better understand and manage spatiotemporal tensions in social-ecological landscapes, highlighting the potential of rhythmanalysis as a tool for crossing scientific and methodological borders. The empirical material is from a study of human and non-human users and uses of the highly valued Dovrefjell mountain area in Norway, with particular attention to the much-debated Snoheim Road. We take an in-depth view of three different, but interrelated, rhythms at Dovrefjell and discuss how intervening through rhythms can be a fruitful way to approach landscape management. By simultaneously 'listening' to different rhythms, this approach helps us to understand and reduce spatiotemporal tensions between social, cultural and ecological uses of a landscape.

AB  - The usefulness of ecoregions for discriminating between littoral macroinvertebrate assemblages of 363 Swedish lakes was examined. A relatively good correspondence was found between ecoregion delineations and macroinvertebrate assemblages of the lake littoral zone. Variables describing macroinvertebrate assemblages (abundance, taxon richness, diversity, and Sorensen similarity) had significantly different values in the 6 ecoregions, but the most marked differences occurred between the middle and southern boreal regions, coinciding with the approximate location of the ecotone delineating the northern coniferous (taiga) and southern deciduous forests. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of lakes in the south were generally more diverse, having more taxa, whereas lakes in the north in general and in the arctic-alpine complex in particular were characterized by low richness and the presence of 2 plecopterans, namely Diura nanseni (Kempny) and Capnia atra Morton. Twenty-five variables made significant contributions to explaining the variance among species assemblages. In the constrained ordination of taxa and environmental factors by canonical correspondence analysis, variables indicative of geographic position (latitude and longitude), ecosystem type (water color and lake surface area), and habitat type (pebble substratum) were among the first 5 variables selected. Discriminant analysis of 25 environmental variables and 6 UPGMA (flexible beta unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) groups classified 64% of the sites to the correct group.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) in northern temperate forests is an important part of the global carbon cycle. Because NPP often is limited by nitrogen (N), atmospheric N deposition (N-dep) may increase forest NPP. At a northern hardwood forest site in northern Lower Michigan, USA, we quantified rates of N supply by N-dep, canopy retention of N-dep (N-cr), and soil net N mineralization (N-min); calculated the N requirement of NPP; and estimated the fraction of NPP that could be attributed to atmospheric N inputs. Net N mineralization supplied 42.6 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) (84% of the NPP N requirement), and N-dep averaged 7.5 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) (15%). The forest canopy retained 38% of N-dep (N-cr = 2.8 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1)), primarily in the forms of organic N and NH4-N. Fine root (62%) and leaf (31%) N requirements dominated the NPP N requirement of 50.7 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1). Annual N supply by the processes we measured agreed very closely with the NPP N requirement, suggesting that internally cycled N and N of atmospheric origin contribute to the N nutrition of this forest. Our results indicate that up to 15% of the NPP at this site may be driven by atmospheric N inputs.

AB  - Here, we use a unique long-term data set on total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes, its climatic drivers and effects of land management from a large boreal watershed in northern Finland. TOC and runoff have been monitored at several sites in the Simojoki watershed (3160km(2)) since the early 1960s. Annual TOC fluxes have increased significantly together with increased inter-annual variability. Acid deposition in the area has been low and has not significantly influenced losses of TOC. Forest management, including ditching and clear felling, had a minor influence on TOC fluxes - seasonal and long-term patterns in TOC were controlled primarily by changes in soil frost, seasonal precipitation, drought, and runoff. Deeper soil frost led to lower spring TOC concentrations in the river. Summer TOC concentrations were positively correlated with precipitation and soil moisture not temperature. There is some indication that drought conditions led to elevated TOC concentrations and fluxes in subsequent years (1998-2000). A sensitivity analysis of the INCA-C model results showed the importance of landscape position, land-use type, and soil temperature as controls of modeled TOC concentrations. Model predictions were not sensitive to forest management. Our results are contradictory to some earlier plot-scale and small catchment studies that have shown more profound forest management impacts on TOC fluxes. This shows the importance of scale when assessing the mechanisms controlling TOC fluxes and concentrations. The results highlight the value of long-term multiple data sets to better understand ecosystem response to land management, climate change and extremes in northern ecosystems.

AB  - Europe has a wealth of community forest arrangements. This paper aims to transcend the diversity of locally specific terms and forms, to highlight the value of considering them inclusively. Building on methods to make sense of diversity, we use reflexive grounded inquiry in fifteen cases in Italy, Scotland, Slovenia and Sweden. Within four dimensions (forest, community, relationships between them, and relationships with wider society), we identify 43 subdimensions to describe them collectively. Our approach shows how European arrangements contribute to wider discourses of collective natural resource management. Both tradition and innovation in Europe inform options for environmental governance. Arrangements challenge the distinction between 'communities of place' and 'communities of interest', with implications for social and environmental justice. They exemplify multilevel environmental governance through both vertical and horizontal connections. Emerging from long histories of political and environmental pressures, they have a role in enhancing society's connection with nature and adaptive capacity.

AB  - Background: While the unique marine and coastal environment of the Baltic Sea provides numerous ecosystem services, its ecosystems are under pressure due to the intensification and diversification of anthropogenic uses. This present work constitutes a systematic map of the evidence of the impacts of ecosystem services and disservices on human health and well-being. The aim is to create a better understanding of the threats of unsustainable management or the benefits of sustainable management of the Baltic Sea and the impacts these may have on the health and well-being of human populations and present these findings to policy advisors. The mapping process is described, and the characteristics of the evidence base are presented.
   Methods: The applied method has been previously published in a systematic map protocol. Literature searches were carried out in English considering published peer-reviewed literature from traditional scientific journals and scientific reports from the grey literature, using synthesis software. A total of 17 databases were searched. Articles were screened in stages at title and abstract stage, then full-text stage. Geographic limitations were placed on the searches in accordance with research funders call, however, watersheds that had an impact on the Baltic Sea marine and coastal regions were considered. We used the more open PEO format, where population (P) included the human populations within the marine and coastal environment of the Baltic Sea region, exposure (E) related to the Baltic Sea ecosystems services and disservices, and the outcome (O) included all aspects of human health and well-being. After full-text screening articles selected for inclusion were searched for metadata connected to bibliographic information, ecosystem services, health and well-being outcomes and policy relevance.
   Review findings: Out of 6456 hits only 460 studies discussed either health or well-being indicators to some extent. Of these, only 67 explicitly mentioned ecosystem services and health and well-being indicators. However, few in this subset engaged with the topic of ecosystem services or disservices and health and well-being in depth. Studies are increasingly relating the two concepts but currently it is mainly studies focussed on cultural ecosystem services that deal with the concept of health and well-being to a greater degree. Studies in the medical literature relating to impacts on health from exposure to the Baltic Sea did not relate their findings to ecosystem services. The database of 67 studies is attached as Additional file 5.
   Conclusions: Ecosystem services play an important role in human health and well-being; however, we found few studies that explicitly examine these impacts in detail. Further research is needed to link the health and well-being outcomes from the Baltic Sea to the ecosystem services supplied and therefore to demonstrate the benefits and disservices provided by the Baltic Sea ecosystems to human populations.

AB  - The possibilities for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the pulp and paper industry by calcium carbonation are presented. The current precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) production uses mined, crushed calcium carbonate as raw materials. If calcium silicates were used instead, carbon dioxide emissions from the calcination of carbonates would be eliminated. In Finland, there could, thus, be a potential for eliminating 200 kt of carbon dioxide emissions per year, considering only the PCC used in the pulp and paper industry. A preliminary investigation of the feasibility to produce PCC from calcium silicates and the potential to replace calcium carbonate as the raw material was made. Calcium carbonate can be manufactured from calcium silicates by various methods, but only a few have been experimentally verified. The possibility and feasibility of these methods as a replacement for the current PCC production process was studied by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using HSC software and process modelling using Aspen Plus((R)). The results from the process modelling showed that a process that uses acetic acid for extraction of the calcium ions is a high potential option for sequestering carbon dioxide by mineral carbonation. The main obstacle seems to be the limited availability and relatively high price of wollastonite, which is a mineral with high calcium silicate content. An alternative is to use the more common, but also more complex, basalt rock instead. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In arctic ecosystems, climate change has increased plant productivity. As arctic carbon (C) stocks predominantly are located belowground, the effects of greater plant productivity on soil C storage will significantly determine the net sink/source potential of these ecosystems, but vegetation controls on soil CO2 efflux remain poorly resolved.
   In order to identify the role of canopy-forming species in belowground C dynamics, we conducted a girdling experiment with plots distributed across 1 km(2) of treeline birch (Betula pubescens) forest and willow (Salix lapponum) patches in northern Sweden and quantified the contribution of canopy vegetation to soil CO2 fluxes and belowground productivity.
   Girdling birches reduced total soil CO2 efflux in the peak growing season by 53%, which is double the expected amount, given that trees contribute only half of the total leaf area in the forest. Root and mycorrhizal mycelial production also decreased substantially. At peak season, willow shrubs contributed 38% to soil CO2 efflux in their patches.
   Our findings indicate that C, recently fixed by trees and tall shrubs, makes a substantial contribution to soil respiration. It is critically important that these processes are taken into consideration in the context of a greening arctic because productivity and ecosystem C sequestration are not synonymous.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in managing forest stands as uneven-aged structures to promote sustainable harvests as well as maintain ecosystem services. This study provides a framework for simulating conversion of mature even-aged stands to uneven-aged slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) stands using the USDA Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) model. A total of 73 scenarios, representing combinations of two harvest methods (based on either "BDq" and/or "low thinning"), two harvesting cycles (10 or 20 years), three harvest intensities (4.6 or 8.0 or 11.5 m(2) ha(-1) residual basal areas), and six levels of regeneration (0-2,224 seedlings ha(-1)) were evaluated for structural diversity, timber production, and carbon (C) stocks over a 100-year period. The BDq harvest approach, which applied selection cutting based on diameter regulation from the first cutting cycle onwards, resulted in higher structural diversity. Scenarios based on low thinning in the first cutting cycle and BDq method from the third cutting cycle onwards tended to result in higher total merchantable timber and C stocks over the entire simulation period, particularly at higher residual basal areas and longer cutting cycles. None of the scenarios maximized all of the three variables simultaneously. Based on the desired objectives, land managers can choose among scenarios presented. The study revealed that regeneration and establishment of as low as 247 seedlings ha(-1) can lead to successful conversion and multiple benefits from uneven-aged slash pine stands.

AB  - Background: Forest management aims at obtaining a sustainable production of wood to be harvested to generate products or energy. However, the quantitative influence of forest management and of removals by harvest on biomass stocks has rarely been analysed on a large scale based on measurements. Two hypotheses prevail: management induces a reduction of wood stocks due to cuttings, versus no impact because of increased growth of the remaining trees.
   Using data collected for 2840 permanent plots across Romania from the National Forest Inventory representing similar to 2.5 Mha, we have tested to what extent different management types and treatments can influence the biomass stock and productivity of beech forests, and attempt to quantify these effects both on the short and long terms.
   Three main types of beech forest management are implemented in Romania with specific objectives: intensive wood production in production forests, protection of ecosystem services (e.g. watersheds, avalanche protection) in protection forests, and protection of the forest and its biodiversity in protected forests. Production forests encompass two treatments differing according to the stand regeneration method: the age class rotation management and the group shelterwood management.
   Results: We show that forest management had little influence on the biomass stocks at a given stand age. The highest stocks at stand age 100 were observed in production forests (the most intensively managed forests). Consequences of early cuttings were very short-termed because the increase in tree growth rapidly compensated for tree cuttings. The cumulated biomass of production forests exceeded that of protected and protection forests. Regarding the treatment, the group shelterwood forests had a markedly higher production over a full rotation period.
   The total amount of deadwood was primarily driven by the amount of standing deadwood, and no management effect was detected.
   Conclusions: Given the relatively low-intensity management in Romania, forest management had no negative impact on wood stocks in beech forests biomass stocks at large scale. Stand productivity was very similar among management types or treatments. However cumulated biomass in production forests was higher than in protection or protected forests, and differed markedly according to treatments with a higher cumulated biomass in shelterwood forests.

AB  - Protected natural areas are a significant tourism resource in many countries, including Norway, Sweden, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The provision of tourism facilities in such areas is increasing but this is not without controversy. Tensions have arisen in some areas where international tourist visitation is believed to be affecting traditional cultural and recreational practices. Despite this, little research attention has been given to exploring local users' attitudes towards tourism activities in areas where they have traditionally not existed. Using Fiordland National Park as a case study, this paper reports research on recreational wilderness use in New Zealand by locals and visiting international tourists. Its focus is on local recreationists' attitudes towards international wilderness tourism. The discussion draws on data gathered using in-depth interviews and research diaries. Findings revealed that international tourists were often viewed as a threat to New Zealanders' recreation opportunities and cultural identity. These attitudes appear to be influenced by widely held values and beliefs about the purpose of public conservation lands. A consideration of the links between the natural environment and national identity is seen as crucial when planning for tourism in protected natural areas in the future.

AB  - Man has exploited land and forests in Western and Central Europe longer and more intensively than in Northern Europe and further east in Eurasia. We estimated forest naturalness and modelled expected biodiversity loss in seven different landscapes (2500 km(2) each) in the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Poland, St. Petersburg (Western European Russia), Perm (Eastern European Russia), and Irkutsk (Central Siberia) across the distribution of Pinus sylvestris L. in Eurasia. Field inventories showed that the mean living tree volumes were relatively similar ill the studied sites, but the volumes of dead wood differed greatly. In Irkutsk and Perm the volume of dead trees per ha was about 5-10 times larger than in Central and Western European regions. The studied forests were generally young in all regions except for Irkutsk, where about half of the study plots had trees older than 120 years. Signs of recent forest fires were found almost exclusively on Russian sites. According to Landsat satellite image-based land-cover classifications the amount of remaining forest habitat in the studied landscapes varied from 25% in the Netherlands 10 93% in Irkutsk. Estimated by forest patch size and density of cut stumps, forests were also more fragmented and heavily managed in the western study landscapes compared to eastern ones. Based on species-area relationship functions, we calculated that the proportion of forest-dwelling species already extinct or expected to become extinct due to habitat loss ranges from 1-2% in Irkutsk to 13-24% in the Netherlands study landscape. For saproxylic species, which depend on dead wood, the extinction estimates were calculated based on remaining dead wood volume in the landscape. The modelled expected loss of saproxylic species ranged from 7-14% in Irkutsk to 35-58% in the Netherlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Western Norway, farmers have traditionally used fire as a management tool in coastal heathlands to enhance the fodder quality for livestock. Rotational prescribed burning increases landscape heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different regeneration stages of heather. Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) responses to fire in traditionally managed coastal heathland have already been studied, but less is known about other beetle groups in this system. We compared the beetle activity between patches of mature and recently burnt heath, by looking at diversity indices, species composition and ecological preferences and traits. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find an increase in beta diversity after disturbance, but we found that prescribed burning offers micro-environmental conditions which enhanced the activity of sun-loving and xerophilous species. We also identified new indicator species for both mature and pioneer heath in five beetle families: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, Leiodidae, and Scirtidae. Rotational prescribed burning was confirmed to be an efficient conservation tool for specialists without affecting the overall diversity of the site. We recommend the use of several taxa, ecological preferences and traits to assess the impact of prescribed burning and to monitor the condition of traditionally managed coastal heathlands.

AB  - Mountain forests provide many important ecosystem services including protection against avalanche and rock fall. These services often depend on a continuity of forest cover and therefore on ecological stability-resistance and resilience to disturbance. Natural regeneration following large-scale disturbance is an important component of forest resilience but in the mountain forests of the Alps is not well understood. This restricts management decision making, particularly in the face of an increased threat to the currently dominant Norway spruce from the bark beetle (Ips typographus). In light of this, we analyzed bark beetle infestation patterns, forest structure, selected tree regeneration characteristics and species composition on 96 study plots on a chronosequence of bark beetle-induced natural forest succession in unmanaged mountain forest ecosystems in southeastern Germany. The most advanced plots were twenty years on from the bark beetle-induced dieback of mature Norway spruce, and the majority were already quite densely stocked. The regeneration was clustered and was dominated by sycamore maple and Norway spruce. Most notably, the proportion of advance regeneration was negligible with the vast majority of the seedlings having germinated after the disturbance event. The findings suggest that these forests are naturally resilient in terms of regeneration if high browsing intensities do not prohibit the establishment of new seedlings. The bark beetle outbreaks appear to have generated an acceleration of development away from human influenced pure Norway spruce forests toward a more natural species composition. Nevertheless, Norway spruce will remain the dominant species for at least the next generation. These findings are important for managers intending to uphold protective forest functions. The integration of naturally evolving gaps as elements which diversify environmental conditions on the forest stand level as well as on the landscape scale is recommended for close-to-nature forest management.

AB  - The North German Lowland is a region with locally high nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in seepage water, inducing an increased susceptibility to the effects of climate change. The future risk of rising NO3- concentrations in seepage water from forests was quantified for four regions in the North German Lowland using climate projections and a modelling system comprising submodels for forest stand development (WaldPlaner), water budgets (WaSiM-ETH), and biogeochemical element cycles (VSD+). The simulations for the period from 1990 to 2070 included three different forest management scenarios (reference, biodiversity, and climate protection) and showed a general decrease in groundwater recharge which could hardly be influenced by any of the management options. The simulated soil organic matter stocks adequately represented their past increase as expected from the National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI), but also showed a future decline under climate change conditions which leads to higher organic matter decomposition and a long-lasting increase of NO3- leaching from forest soils. While the climate protection oriented scenario shows the highest increase in NO3- concentrations during the projection period until 2070, the biodiversity scenario kept NO3- concentrations in seepage water below the legal thresholds in three of four selected model regions.

AB  - Palsa mires are northern mire complexes with permanently frozen peat hummocks. These are degrading throughout their distribution range, probably because of regional climatic warming. This review of the current understanding of the geographical, climatic and biological characteristics of palsa mires focuses on Europe. Recent studies have reported a drastic decrease in the extent of palsa mires in Fennoscandia; in Finland, the distribution of palsas was formerly about three times that at present. With continued or accelerated warming, as predicted for high latitudes, further extensive degradation or the wholesale disappearance of palsa mires seems inevitable. Palsa mires are known to be biologically heterogeneous environments with a rich diversity of bird species, and they are listed as a priority habitat type by the European Union. However, their role as habitats for other organisms is still poorly understood. There is urgent need for research and monitoring to assess the ecological and biological consequences of the decline of palsa mires in Europe.

AB  - One of the possibilities to expand sea-based fish farming is to move aquaculture installations away from the conflicts of the coastal zone, and into more open ocean locations. However, open ocean aquaculture places different demands on structures than aquaculture in sheltered locations. In this context, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of the aquaculture structures as they are exposed to large sea-loads from waves and current. Flexible netting is the main part of most sea-based aquaculture structures, and in this paper the interaction between waves and netting is studied. Experiments were conducted at the narrow wave flume facility at the University of Oslo, Norway, where several different regular wave cases were run through netting with different solidity. The wave geometry was measured on each side of the net to determine how the wave changed as it moved trough the net. In particular, the damping effect of the net on the passing wave was analysed, but also more subtle features, such as crest steepness and asymmetry factors where studied. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wind is one of the major natural forest disturbances in Europe, and reduces the total economic (including carbon sequestration) value of forests. The aim of this study was to assess the financial benefit of silvicultural measures in young, pure, planted Norway spruce stands by reduction in the impact of wind damage over the rotation period. The analyzed measures are promptly applied precommercial thinning and low-density planting with improved plant material. Spatial information on factors affecting wind damage-wind climate and soil-were gathered and combined with the local growth model and empirical data from tree pulling experiments in Latvia to assess the economic value loss due to wind damage over a rotation period. Timely precommercial thinning and lower-density planting with improved plant material would ensure a positive net present value with an interest rate of 3%, using conservative estimates. The financial benefit is highest in windier (coastal) regions and for the planting, followed by moderate thinning. The results demonstrate that, even without changing the dominant tree species, a considerable reduction in wind-damage risk can be achieved.

AB  - The distribution of functional traits within and across spatiotemporal scales has been used to quantify and infer the relative resilience across ecosystems. We use explicit spatial modeling to evaluate within-and cross-scale redundancy in headwater streams, an ecosystem type with a hierarchical and dendritic network structure. We assessed the cross-scale distribution of functional feeding groups of benthic invertebrates in Swedish headwater streams during two seasons. We evaluated functional metrics, i.e., Shannon diversity, richness, and evenness, and the degree of redundancy within and across modeled spatial scales for individual feeding groups. We also estimated the correlates of environmental versus spatial factors of both functional composition and the taxonomic composition of functional groups for each spatial scale identified. Measures of functional diversity and within-scale redundancy of functions were similar during both seasons, but both within-and cross-scale redundancy were low. This apparent low redundancy was partly attributable to a few dominant taxa explaining the spatial models. However, rare taxa with stochastic spatial distributions might provide additional information and should therefore be considered explicitly for complementing future resilience assessments. Otherwise, resilience may be underestimated. Finally, both environmental and spatial factors correlated with the scale-specific functional and taxonomic composition. This finding suggests that resilience in stream networks emerges as a function of not only local conditions but also regional factors such as habitat connectivity and invertebrate dispersal.

AB  - Background: Agriculture can have substantial negative impacts on the environment. The establishment and management of vegetated strips adjacent to farmed fields (including various field margins, buffer strips and hedgerows) are commonly advocated mitigation measures for these negative environmental impacts. However, it may be difficult to obtain reliable evidence on the effects of implementation and management of vegetated strips, even though a substantial body of evidence exists. We describe a systematic map of research relating to vegetated strips in boreo-temperate farming systems to answer the question: What evidence exists regarding the effects of field margins on nutrients, pollutants, socioeconomics, biodiversity, and soil retention in boreo-temperate systems?
   Methods: We searched 13 bibliographic databases, 1 search engine and 37 websites of stakeholder organisations using a predefined and tested search string focusing on a comprehensive list of English language vegetated strip synonyms. Searches in Danish, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish were also conducted using web searches. We screened search results at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of studies deemed non-relevant (with reasons at full text). A systematic map database of meta-data (i.e. descriptive summary information about the settings and methods) for relevant studies was produced following full text assessment. The systematic map database is provided as an evidence atlas: interactive, web-based geographical information system.
   Results: Over 31,000 search results were identified, resulting in a total of 1072 relevant primary research studies and 130 evidence reviews. Articles used a variety of terminology to describe vegetated strips, with 'field margin', 'hedge-row', 'shelterbelt' and 'riparian buffer' most common. The volume of primary research is increasing linearly year-by-year, whilst the increase in reviews has tailed off in the last 10 years. The USA and UK were most frequently studied and reviewed. Arable systems were investigated in c. 70% of primary research but 50% of reviews. Some 50% of primary research vegetated strips were field edge and 25% riparian, whilst riparian and field edge strips were roughly equally the focus of around a half of all described strips in reviews. Terrestrial biodiversity, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and soil/water loss or retention were the most commonly measured outcomes in primary studies and reviews, although some other outcomes were more common in reviews than research articles (e.g. pesticides).
   Conclusions: We identified substantial bodies of evidence on particular sets of related outcomes and ecosystem services, which constitute important knowledge clusters/synthesis gaps relating to: strip width, terrestrial biodiversity, nutrient retention, hydrological regimes, toxic substances, erosion protection, pests, carbon sequestration, and soil and biodiversity combined. We also identified key knowledge gaps relating to: climate regulation, freshwater biodiversity, strip harvesting, cultural ecosystem services, long-term impacts, the relationship between pest populations and crop yield, fuel and fibre production, specific regions and countries (e.g. Russia and South America), and multi-use vegetated strips. This systematic map is an important step in identifying what research has been done to date, and what primary and secondary research is needed as the next step for this topic.

AB  - A stalled urbanization process in Serbia is an obstacle to the national economic growth. One of the reasons for that is a poor local economic development, which is caused also by the lack of efficient urban land management system in Serbia. Thus, in order to encourage sustainable urban development, local self-governments in Serbia need a new model of sustainable urban planning and urban land management that should include market-based instruments, like, investments, required for the urban renewal process triggering. Aiming to underpin this strategic ambitious, Serbian Ministry of construction, transport and infrastructure, Republic geodetic authority and Swedish partners are implementing a Project "Improvement of Investment Environment in Serbia" in order to establish a National Register of Investment Locations (NRIL) and related monitoring system, which would improve efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making process for the investment locations and urban land use management in general within 11 pilot local self-governments. Building of this register and its monitoring system would include development of an investment location data model, centralized database and 3 Web-based applications for the investment-related data collection and their interactive visualization using the Serbian National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework and advantages of its geoportal Geosrbija. Also, to increase the role of Serbian cities and strengthen corrective function of the urban plans and urban planning in general, one of the Project objectives is to provide a direct communication channel between the potential investors and local self-governments. Finally, it is expected that the Project results would be implemented in the other local self-governments in Serbia as well, and that they would contribute to the goals achievement of a recently adopted national Sustainable Urban Development Strategy 2030, as well as to some other strategic projects and initiatives launching in Serbia.

AB  - In this study, potential storage sites in the subsurface of the North Sea are analyzed to estimate the available CO2 storage capacity. In total 441 sites in five countries (United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands and Germany) are studied in terms of geophysical characteristics and potential capacity. Instead of a simple volume-based approach that tends to over-estimate capacity, we consider storage limited by the time-dependent pressure increase in each injection well. We used literature data to estimate the geological and physical properties of the storage formations. The study confirmed a tremendous potential for CO2 storage approaching 440 Gt with a possible injection rate of 22 Gt yr(-1). The United Kingdom can potentially store more than 230 Gt of CO2 over 30 years, a value 20 times higher than its current emissions, while the same scales apply for the Netherlands with 147 Gt CO2 potential. The thirteen oil and gas fields examined in Denmark are able to store around 4 Gt of CO2 over three decades at a rate of 127 Mt yr(-1) covering more than twice the current emissions, while Norway can store 48 Gt from just 10 large saline aquifers. Despite the potential uncertainties in the data, there is sufficient capacity for CO2 storage to play a significant role in Europe to avert a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees C this century.

AB  - Brazil is one of the largest producers of eucalyptus that is used for manufacturing pulp and paper; this contributes directly to the issue of carbon emissions. Reforestation of eucalyptus appears as a viable alternative for mitigating these carbon emissions, leveraging their high productivity to that of other leading countries in the market, such as Finland and Sweden. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring and evaluating forest growth and quantifying wood stocks and sequestered carbon. System dynamics was used to simulate forest growth. Forest growth was modeled from eight regions with dissimilar edaphoclimatic characteristics, in the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The model was sensitive enough to the characteristics of the regions, where the difference in forest stocks was 45.1% at the end of 30 years in a harvest cycle of 7 years. It was found that the typical harvest cycle in practice by leading companies did not always yield a higher sequestered CO2 accumulated stock. By shortening the harvest cycle, it was possible to obtain a gain of up to 21.0% in the sequestered CO2 stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Podzols often occur in association with organic soils along sequences governed by relief, with peats in depressions and podzols on slopes. The fort-nation of bogs has also been described as a soil-induced process: the formation of cemented pans, impermeable to water, in highly developed podzols, enhanced the accumulation of organic matter and slowed down its decomposition. Humans may interfere with soil development, enhancing acidification and thus the eluvial phase of podzolisation, as it may be in the case of acid precipitation or of the plantation of conifers. The aim of this work was to study the transition between Spodosols and Histosols, in the Krkonoe National Park (CZ), where spruce has substituted the natural vegetation and acid precipitation has damaged several areas of the park. The soils were studied at two sites: one site is relatively preserved and soils (Spodosols and Inceptisols) develop on a steep slope. At the other site, a gently undulating mountain summit, Spodosols are associated to Histosols and the forest decline is more severe. Three Spodosols (Humic Haplocryod, Typic Cryaquod, Placic Cryaquod) and a Histosol were selected at the second site, and the soil properties and organic matter dynamics were compared to those of a Typic Haplocryod sampled at the first site. Profile morphology and chemical analyses indicated that podzolisation has been more intense at the second site, probably because of the differences in relief and in the amount of water available for pedogenic processes: a high accumulation of organic matter and thick Bhs horizons were the most striking differences, together with depletion in Fe from eluvial horizons. Moreover a trend in the chemical indicators of podzolisation was appreciated among the profiles sampled at the second site. The analyses of organic matter and humic substances indicated that, in Bs horizons, the organic matter characteristics were very similar in the two sites, but in the eluvial and organic horizons marked differences appeared. At the first site, the fulvic acids in the E horizons were small and oxidised, similar therefore to those found in the Bhs horizons, whereas at the second site fulvic acids became bigger, more aliphatic and less oxidised and were therefore less prone to migration. Some of these properties of organic matter were linked to soil water regime, others to the shift in vegetation from forest to grass cover and seemed therefore to be related to the soil evolution itself, being podzolisation in this sense a self-limiting process. Acid precipitation may however have played a role in the change of size of fulvic acids, which were very rich in sulphur, through C-S linkages. The complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors seemed to have decreased the ability of organic matter to migrate, enhancing the formation of Histosols. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study from Fjellfrosvatn, an oligotrophic lake in northern Norway, the parasite communities in two sympatric Arctic charr populations were compared. The dwarf morph, which inhabits the profundal zone, exhibited the lowest parasite diversity, seven species, and 72% of these charr harboured only one or two parasite species. In contrast, 10 parasite species were encountered in the larger normal charr, and between 5 and 8 species were present in 73% of these fish, which also utilised a broader food and habitat niche. Proteocephalus sp. was by far the most abundant species in the dwarf charr, probably because this morph fed intensively upon the benthic copepod Acanthocyclops gigas. On the other hand, parasites that are transmitted with littoral benthic prey (i.e., Phyllodistomum umblae, Cyathocephalus truncatus, Cystidicola farionis, and Crepidostomum spp.) were almost absent in the dwarf charr, though they were common in the normal morph. Also, Diphyllobothrium spp. were more prevalent in the normal charr, and this was attributed to their feeding upon limnetic copepods in the pelagic zone. The only recorded parasite with a direct life cycle, the copepod Salmincola edwardsii, had relatively similar abundances in the two morphs. The considerable differences in parasite community structure and abundance between the two charr populations were closely related to differences in the width and composition of the habitat and food niches between the morphs.

AB  - Biogenic production and release of methane (CH4) from thawing permafrost has the potential to be a strong source of radiative forcing. We investigated changes in the active layer microbial community of three sites representative of distinct permafrost thaw stages at a palsa mire in northern Sweden. The palsa site (intact permafrost and low radiative forcing signature) had a phylogenetically clustered community dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria. The bog (thawing permafrost and low radiative forcing signature) had lower alpha diversity and midrange phylogenetic clustering, characteristic of ecosystem disturbance affecting habitat filtering. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens and Acidobacteria dominated the bog shifting from palsa-like to fen-like at the waterline. The fen (no underlying permafrost, high radiative forcing signature) had the highest alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity, was dominated by Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota and was significantly enriched in methanogens. The Mire microbial network was modular with module cores consisting of clusters of Acidobacteria, Euryarchaeota or Xanthomonodales. Loss of underlying permafrost with associated hydrological shifts correlated to changes in microbial composition, alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity associated with a higher radiative forcing signature. These results support the complex role of microbial interactions in mediating carbon budget changes and climate feedback in response to climate forcing.

AB  - Fine roots play a critical role in terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling. Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the fine root dynamics in plantations and natural secondary forests is lacking. This study examined the dynamics of fine root biomass and necromass of Chinese fir plantations and natural secondary forests (5-41 years old) and employed primary forests as a reference in subtropical China. In the top 60-cm soil depth, the sum of fine root biomass of Chinese fir plantations and natural secondary forests initially increased and then decreased with stand development, attaining a peak in the 27-31-year age class. The total fine root biomass of natural secondary forests was significantly higher than that of Chinese fir plantations across all age classes. The total fine root biomass of primary forests was similar to that in the 38-41-year-old natural secondary forests and Chinese fir plantations. The total fine root necromass was higher in Chinese fir plantations than in natural secondary forests across all ages except in the youngest age class. The necromass to biomass ratio was significantly higher in Chinese fir plantations. Most of the fine root biomass resided in the topsoil (0-10 cm) for all stand types and ages. The higher fine root biomass in the secondary natural forests than in the Chinese fir plantation was most apparent in the topsoil. Across all age classes, the fine root biomass was positively correlated with stand basal area, mean diameter at breast height, and shrub cover, whereas the fine root necromass and the necromass to biomass ratio tended to be more consistent across measured stand characteristics. Our results highlight profound influences of forest management on fine root biomass and necromass and suggest that the low fine root biomass of Chinese fir plantations may have a negative impact on carbon and nutrient cycling in the subtropical forests.

AB  - Within-city green infrastructure can offer opportunities and new contexts for people to become stewards of ecosystem services. We analyze cities as social-ecological systems, synthesize the literature, and provide examples from more than 15 years of research in the Stockholm urban region, Sweden. The social-ecological approach spans from investigating ecosystem properties to the social frameworks and personal values that drive and shape human interactions with nature. Key findings demonstrate that urban ecosystem services are generated by social-ecological systems and that local stewards are critically important. However, land-use planning and management seldom account for their role in the generation of urban ecosystem services. While the small scale patchwork of land uses in cities stimulates intense interactions across borders much focus is still on individual patches. The results highlight the importance and complexity of stewardship of urban biodiversity and ecosystem services and of the planning and governance of urban green infrastructure.

AB  - This paper describes forest stands on four permanent research plots (PRP) situated in the National Park of Krkonose (Czech Republic) and Karkonoski Park Narodowy (Poland). The aim of this paper was to evaluate basic forest stand characteristics with emphasis on natural regeneration of silver (Abies alba Mill.) as result of active forest management in the past decades. The horizontal structure of the overstorey was mostly random and that of natural regeneration was aggregated. The vertical structure was distinctly more differentiated in forest stands with largely advanced regeneration compared to stands in the initial stage of regeneration. This mixed near-natural forests with silver fir on the studied PRP were characterized by the significantly differentiated structure that is connected with long-term anthropogenic influences. The standing volume of the main and secondary stand on the particular PRP was in the range of 237-598 m(3).ha(-1). It has been documented on the studied plots that hoofed game had a very negative or even destructive influence on fir natural regeneration. Distinct stand variability was indicated by all used structural indices, also species richness on the particular plots showed high variability, the characteristics of stand density indicated relatively high diversity and complexity of the structure of mixed fir stands on all PRP.

AB  - Question: We studied the patterns of plant species co-occurrence on three, nested, spatial scales in semi-natural grassland communities and explored the possible ecological processes underlying the patterns.
   Location: Dry, semi-natural grasslands in a 4.5 km x 4.5 km area on the Baltic Island of land ( Sweden).
   Methods: The study used replicated samples on three, nested, spatial scales: 50 cm x 50 cm plots ( N = 516), grassland patches ( N = 109) and the whole landscape ( N = 6). We used a null model approach to study species co-occurrence patterns and compared the ecological amplitudes of the pairs of species contributing most to the patterns. We used linear models to search for associations between species segregation and environmental and landscape factors.
   Results and Conclusions: Our results support the prediction that patterns of species co-occurrence are likely to be influenced by different mechanisms on different spatial scales. On the plot scale, we interpreted the species segregation in terms of species interactions. The degree of species segregation was significantly associated with the plots' positions within the grassland patches ( edge effects) and with management intensity of the grasslands - both variables can be assumed to influence species interactions. On the grassland patch scale, we interpreted the species segregation in terms of within-patch environmental heterogeneity. The degree of segregation was significantly associated with the area of the grassland patches and with management intensity - both variables that are likely to be related to environmental heterogeneity within the grasslands. Species segregation on the landscape scale was interpreted in terms of environmental heterogeneity among grassland patches and was significantly associated with land- use history.

AB  - The offshore gas field named Sleipner-after the mythological horse with eight legs-is situated right in the middle of the North Sea, near the border line between United Kingdom and Norway. The distance from the nearest town on the Norwegian coast, Stavanger, is 240 km. A map is shown in Fig. 1. Together with the even larger Troll gas field further north, Sleipner will produce a larger part of Norway's gas supply to the European Union. It will function as a hub for a number of pipelines transferring this gas from north to south. The field is licenced to the companies Statoil, Esso Norge, Norsk Hydro, Elf Petroleum Norge and TOTAL Norge; with Statoil as field operator. The field was first discovered in 1974 with the gas containing reservoirs laying around 3500 m under the sea bed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current lack of research on the evaluation of marine ecosystem services makes the value of marine protection, development and restoration underestimated during the decision-making process. Based on the nonmonetary ecosystem service evaluation framework, a marine ecosystem service classification and accounting method has been established in this study, and the world's coastal ecosystem services have been measured as an example. The results show that (1) the world's coastal ecosystem service value is about 4.13E+23 sej/yr, of which Asia and North America contribute about 55% of the total service value; (2) the top ten countries in terms of the world's coastal ecosystem service values are Canada, Indonesia, Australia, the United States, Brazil, the Russian Federation, Norway, the Philippines, Mexico, and China, which contribute about 60% of the total service value; (3) estuaries have the highest ecosystem service values, followed by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal flats, salt marshes, and warm water coral reefs; (4) developed countries can make better use of their coastal resources and pay more attention to the marine protection while the opposite is true in developing countries, which means that developed countries still occupy an advantageous position in the process of marine protection, development and utilization. This study assesses the coastal ecosystem service values in various coastal countries from the perspective of ecosystem contributors, emphasizes the importance of protecting them in marine management, and provides a certain reference basis and theoretical support for decision-makers in formulating marine-related protection and development strategies.

AB  - Sugar kelp Saccharina latissima is one of the dominating kelp species on sheltered sublittoral sites along the Norwegian coastline, providing important habitats and ecosystem services. In finfish aquaculture in Norway, infections caused by salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis are one of the biggest challenges the industry is currently facing, and presently the most-used therapeutant is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Commonly, this treatment involves bathing the fish in a solution of approximately 1700 mg H2O2 l(-1) seawater before releasing the solution into the surrounding waters. The present study was conducted to increase the knowledge on how these H2O2 emissions from farm operations could impact juvenile S. latissima. This was achieved by determining the effects of a 1 h exposure to realistic H2O2 levels on S. latissima mortality and photosynthesis. Effects on photosynthesis were determined by incubating plants at 3 time intervals post-exposure. Toxicity potentials including lethal concentration for 50% of the population (LC50) and effective concentration (EC50) for photosynthetic capacity (P-MAX ) and efficiency (alpha) were determined based on these data. Juvenile S. latissima was highly sensitive, having an LC50 of 80.7 mg H2O2 l(-1), which is less than 5% of the dose commonly used at farms and emitted to the environment. A concentration of 85 mg l(-1) caused an immediate 90% reduction in both P-MAX and alpha. The EC50 was found to be 27.8 and 35.4 mg l(-1) for P-MAX and a, respectively. This may indicate that natural S. latissima populations in the vicinity of fish farms can be negatively affected by H2O2 bath treatments.

AB  - We analyzed diversity patterns of alpine tundra ecosystems along environmental gradients. We hypothesized that alpine diversity is affected by climate at local and regional scales, nutrient availability, soil moisture, and disturbance related to herbivory. In all, 232 samples in 11 study areas in Troms and Finnmark counties were analyzed with regard to alpha- and beta-diversity of vascular plants and lichens. Relationships between a-diversity and environmental variables were analyzed by regression trees. beta-diversity defined as species turnover was investigated using indirect ordination methods. Sites with non-acidic soil parent material showed highest species densities. Lowest species numbers were typical for extreme topographic positions. Heavily grazed samples showed less species numbers and coverage percentage of vegetation. The number of graminoid species was found to be highest in areas of high grazing pressure. We concluded that alpha-diversity was controlled by growing season, snow cover, pH, soil moisture, disturbance, temperature, and precipitation, stressing the importance of multi-factorial approaches in diversity studies. Determinants of P-diversity were predominantly local environmental conditions, whereas regional conditions were less important.

Over time different forest management regimes have been implemented but their impact on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales has not been systematically reviewed although non-systematic reviews on the topic exist. The aim of this article is to describe a protocol for a systematic review to synthesise and compare the impacts of two different forest management systems on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales. The topic for the systematic review arose from the discussions with the Finnish forestry sector and was further defined in a stakeholder workshop. Research questions addressed by the systematic review protocol are: (1) What are the stand-level effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on boreal forest biodiversity in Fennoscandia and European Russia? (2) What is the effect of these same forest management systems on biodiversity at landscape level?MethodsAnimal, plant, and fungal diversity is addressed. Bibliographic databases and organizational websites will be searched, and internet search engines will be utilized to find relevant literature. The searches will be conducted in English, Finnish, Swedish, and Russian. Articles will be screened regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria at title, abstract, and full-text stage. The validity of included studies will be evaluated against appraisal criteria and studies categorized based on their risk of bias. A narrative synthesis will be conducted to describe the findings. If enough quantitative data can be retrieved from the studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services, such as aesthetic and recreational enjoyment, as well as sense of place and local identity, play an outstanding role in the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. Online data shared on social networks, particularly geo-tagged photos, are becoming an increasingly attractive source of information about cultural ecosystem services. Landscape photographs tell about the significance of human relationships with landscapes, human practices in landscapes and the landscape features that might possess value in terms of cultural ecosystem services. Despite all the recent advances in this emerging methodological approach, some challenges remain to be explored: (a) how to assess a broad suite of cultural ecosystem services, beyond aesthetic beauty of landscapes, (b) how to identify the landscape features that are relevant for providing cultural ecosystem services and determine trade-offs and synergies among cultural ecosystem services. To address these challenges, we have developed a methodological approach suitable for eliciting the importance of cultural ecosystem services and the landscape features underpinning their provision across five different sites in Europe (in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). We have performed a content analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio platforms that can represent cultural ecosystem services. Four bundles of landscapes features and cultural ecosystem services showed the relation of recreation with mountain areas (terrestrial recreation) and with water bodies (aquatic recreation). Cultural heritage, social and spiritual values were particularly attached to landscapes with woodpastures and grasslands, as well as urban features and infrastructures, i.e. to more anthropogenic landscapes. A positive though weak relationship was found between landscape diversity and cultural ecosystem services diversity. Particularly wood-pastures and shrubs were more frequently portrayed in all study sites in comparison with their actual land cover. The results can be of interest both for methodological purposes in the face of an increasing trend in the use of geo-tagged photos in the ecosystem services research and for the elicitation and comparison of landscape values across European cultural landscapes.

AB  - Most landscapes are comprised of multiple habitat types differing in the biodiversity they contain. This is certainly true for human modified landscapes, which are often a mix of habitats managed with different intensity, semi-natural habitats and even pristine habitats. To understand fundamental questions of how the composition of such landscapes affects biodiversity conservation, and to evaluate biodiversity consequences of policies that affect the composition of landscapes, there is a need for models able to translate information on biodiversity from individual habitats to landscape-wide predictions. However, this is complicated by species richness not being additive. We constructed a model to help analyze and solve this problem based on two simple assumptions. Firstly, that a habitat can be characterized by the biological community inhabiting it; i.e., which species occur and at what densities. Secondly, that the probability of a species occurring in a particular unit of land is dictated by its average density in the associated habitats, its spatial aggregation, and the size of the land unit. This model leads to a multidimensional species-area relation (one dimension per habitat). If the goal is to maximize species diversity at the landscape scale (gamma-diversity), within a fixed area or under a limited budget, the model can be used to find the optimal allocation of the different habitats. In general, the optimal solution depends on the total size of the species pool of the different habitats, but also their similarity (beta-diversity). If habitats are complementary (high beta), a mix is usually preferred, even if one habitat is poorer (lower alpha diversity in one habitat). The model lends itself to economic analyses of biodiversity problems, without the need to monetarize biodiversity value, i.e., cost-effectiveness analysis. Land prices and management costs will affect the solution, such that the model can be used to estimate the number of species gained in relation to expenditure on each habitat. We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to agricultural landscapes in southern Sweden and demonstrate how empirical monitoring data can be used to find the best habitat allocation for biodiversity conservation within and between landscapes.

AB  - With growing demands on forests, there is a need to understand the drivers of managing the forest for diverse objectives, such as production, recreation, and climate adaptation. The aim of this study was to examine the knowledge and value basis of forest management behaviors, including different management strategies and management inactivity, among private forest owners in Sweden. Different dimensions of knowledge (declarative and procedural knowledge, assessed in terms of objective and subjective knowledge measures) and value priorities (basic values and forest values), as well as the role of forest owner identity, were examined. The study was conducted by means of a postal questionnaire to a random sample of private forest owners in Sweden (n = 3000, response rate 43%). The distinctions between actual knowledge (objective knowledge), confidence (subjective knowledge), and value priorities, in addition to the hierarchical structure of how these factors are linked to management behaviors, proved to be valuable. Results revealed that different knowledge dimensions and value priorities were jointly important for forest management behaviors. In addition, the role of forest owner identity for management behaviors was confirmed. Insights from the study may be used to develop policy and outreach to private forest owners and thereby facilitate different forest functions in private forestry.

AB  - This study reports temporal (based on cross-dated dead trees) and spatial patterns of availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) from Picea abies in a Swedish boreal landscape with discrete old-growth forest patches in a wetland matrix. Data were collected from 29 patches ranging in size from 0.3 to 28 ha. A total of 897 dead trees with a minimum diameter of > 15 cm occurred on the 7.2 ha area analysed. The year of death was established for 50 % of these trees.
   CWD volume ranged from 17 to 65 m(3)/ha for downed logs and from 0.5 to 13 m(3)/ha for standing snags. CWD of all decay stages and diameter classes occurred abundantly and the probability of finding logs of all decay stages and sizes was very high at the scale of single hectares. Tree mortality differed among 5 yr periods. However, during the last 50 yr no 5 yr period produced less than 3 logs/ha. Decay rates were highly variable among different logs. Logs with soft wood and some wood pieces lost (decay stage 5) died ca. 34 years ago. This suggests a fairly rapid decay in this northern forest. The data indicate a high and continuous availability of CWD of all types. It is likely, therefore, that selection pressures for efficient dispersal among CWD dependent species may not be very high. Consequently, species with narrow habitat demands and/or low dispersal ability may have evolved and this may contribute to the decrease of certain species in the managed landscape.

AB  - Soft-sediment macrobenthos data for the Norwegian continental shelf (61degreesN, 1 to 2degreesE) was used to examine species distributions, community structure and community differences, and how different measures of biodiversity are related to environmental variability. Water depth at 35 sites ranged from 115 to 331 m over a spatial sampling scale of ca. 45 km x 60 km, and there was considerable variation in sediment characteristics, Of a total of 508 recorded species, 39% were restricted to 1 or 2 sites, whereas only 3 species spanned the entire sampling area. Polychaetes were the most common and widespread taxonomic group; crustaceans and echinoderms were more restricted in their distributions than the other dominant groups. Whittaker's beta diversity measure (beta(W), extent of change in species composition among sites) was highest for those groups with the highest proportion of restricted-range species. The number of shared species, the complementarity (biotic distinctness), and the Bray-Curtis similarity between all pairwise combinations of sites (3 beta diversity measures) were more strongly related to change in environment (notably depth, followed by median grain size and silt-clay content) than to spatial distance between sites. Likewise, a multivariate analysis (BIO-ENV) identified these factors as the major environmental variables influencing the faunal patterns, whereas univariate measures of diversity were not related to depth or median grain size. Univariate measures of diversity, beta diversity measures, and BIO-ENV analyses showed that molluscs, followed by polychaetes, were most highly related to environmental variables. In this study, alpha, beta and gamma diversity were higher than in a study of a single soft-sediment habitat type in the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf.

AB  - Recent ecological changes in a small Scottish mountain loch, Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR), were inferred using Cladocera analysis and an application of a Cladocera-based temperature transfer-function approach. Modem assemblages of Cladocera from 68 mountain lakes in Scotland and Norway were used to derive the transfer function. Among 21 measured environmental variables, mean summer lake surface-water temperature (LSWT) accounted for the highest (8%) variation in a redundancy analysis of the modem data. A quantitative inference model (r(2) = 0.72, RMSEP = 1.81 degrees C) for summer LSWT was developed using linear partial least squares regression and calibration. The resulting reconstructed summer LSWT at LCFR was compared with local instrumental air-temperature records over the last 20 yr and the Central England Temperature (CET) series over the last 110 yr. The reconstruction showed a broadly similar pattern to the local instrumental temperature records. However, the relationship between the longer CET series and reconstructed summer LSWT was poor suggesting that the site was relatively insensitive to temperature changes prior to the recent warming of the last few decades. Clear changes in Cladoceran species diversity and relative abundance of littoral taxa coincident with the most recent period of climate warming recorded both locally and in the CET suggest that Cladocera do respond to climate change. However, their response to temperature is complex and indirect. The underlying mechanism leading to change in Cladocera assemblages may involve changes in trophic status and habitat availability of the system. It is concluded that understanding other factors such as atmospheric pollution, controls of community dynamics of Cladocera and the overall ecological complexity of mountain lakes is required before any reliance can be placed on a Cladocera-temperature transfer-function for reconstructing climatic change.

AB  - Measurements were made of height, diameter and number of trees in the Siberian Afforestation Experiment for monoculture plots with six tree species (Picea abies (=Picea obovata), Pinus sylvestris, Pinus sibirica, Larix sibirica, Populus tremula, Betula pendula), established in the central part of the Krasnoyarsk region. Yield tables were developed for these plantations, and in three of the plantations the tables were developed for management with and without thinning. Almost 150 felled trees were measured to evaluate aboveground biomass fractions and determine biomass dynamics through stand development. Local uncertainties in needle mass dynamics were revealed for Scots and arolla, pine stands. Carbon storage was evaluated for live trees and in biomass of dead trees and fall of branches and needles. Over the 35 years of stand development, these species accumulated 100 to 300 m(3)/ha of wood, with a likely carbon content of about 25 to 75 Mg/ha. The trees also added a large amount of C to the soil in fallen leaves, branches, and dead roots. In this region, Norway spruce and arolla pine form the longest-lived forests, and may have higher productivities than the other species later in stand development.

AB  - Effects of simulated environmental change on bryophyte and lichen species richness and diversity in alpine tundra were investigated in a 5-year experiment at Latnjajaure, northern Sweden. The experiment had a factorial design including fertilisation and temperature enhancement in one meadow and one heath plant community. Responses in species richness, biodiversity, and species composition of bryophytes and lichens to experimental treatments were compared to the observed variation in six naturally occurring plant communities. The combination of fertilisation and enhanced temperature resulted in a species impoverishment, for bryophytes in the bryophyte-dominated community, and for lichens in the lichen-dominated communities, but the species composition stayed within the observed natural variation. During the course of the study, no species new to the investigated mid-alpine landscape were recorded, but that scenario is realistic within a decade when comparing with the processes seen in vascular plants.

AB  - Human-induced climate change and ocean acidification (CC-OA) is changing the physical and biological processes occurring within the marine environment, with poorly understood implications for marine life. Within the aquaculture sector, molluskan culture is a relatively benign method of producing a high-quality, healthy, and sustainable protein source for the expanding human population. We modeled the vulnerability of global bivalve mariculture to impacts of CC-OA over the period 2020-2100, under RCP8.5. Vulnerability, assessed at the national level, was dependent on CC-OA-related exposure, taxon-specific sensitivity and adaptive capacity in the sector. Exposure risk increased over time from 2020 to 2100, with ten nations predicted to experience very high exposure to CC-OA in at least one decade during the period 2020-2100. Predicted high sensitivity in developing countries resulted, primarily, from the cultivation of species that have a narrow habitat tolerance, while in some European nations (France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) high sensitivity was attributable to the relatively high economic value of the shellfish production sector. Predicted adaptive capacity was low in developing countries primarily due to governance issues, while in some developed countries (Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) it was linked to limited species diversity in the sector. Developing and least developed nations (n = 15) were predicted to have the highest overall vulnerability. Across all nations, 2060 was identified as a tipping point where predicted CC-OA will be associated with the greatest challenge to shellfish production. However, rapid declines in mollusk production are predicted to occur in the next decade for some nations, notably North Korea. Shellfish culture offers human society a low-impact source of sustainable protein. This research highlights, on a global scale, the likely extent and nature of the CC-OA-related threat to shellfish culture and this sector enabling early-stage adaption and mitigation.

AB  - Large-domain species distribution models (SDMs) fail to identify microrefugia, as they are based on climate estimates that are either too coarse or that ignore relevant topographic climate-forcing factors. Climate station data are considered inadequate to produce such estimates, a viewpoint we challenge here. Using climate stations and topographic data, we developed three sets of large-domain (450 000 km(2)), fine-grain (50m) temperature grids accounting for different levels of topographic complexity.
   Using these fine-grain grids and the Worldclim data, we fitted SDMs for 78 alpine species over Sweden, and assessed over-versus underestimations of local extinction and area of microrefugia by comparing modelled distributions at species' rear edges. Accounting for well-known topographic climate-forcing factors improved our ability to model fine-scale climate, despite using only climate station data. This approach captured the effect of cool air pooling, distance to sea, and relative humidity on local-scale temperature, but the effect of solar radiation could not be accurately accounted for. Predicted extinction rate decreased with increasing spatial resolution of the climate models and with increasing number of topographic climate-forcing factors accounted for. About half of the microrefugia detected in the most topographically complete models were not detected in the coarser SDMs and in the models calibrated from climate variables extracted from elevation only.
   Although major limitations remain, climate station data can potentially be used to produce fine-grain topoclimate grids, opening up the opportunity to model local-scale ecological processes over large domains. Accounting for the topographic complexity encountered within landscapes permits the detection of microrefugia that would otherwise remain undetected. Topographic heterogeneity is likely to have a massive impact on species persistence, and should be included in studies on the effects of climate change.

AB  - Human-induced changes of the environment, including landscape alteration and habitat loss, may affect wildlife disease dynamics and have important ramifications for wildlife conservation. Amphibians are among the vertebrate taxa most threatened by anthropogenic habitat change. The emerging fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused extinctions and population declines in hundreds of anuran species globally. We studied how the urban landscape is associated with the prevalence of Bd infections by sampling 655 anurans of 3 species (mainly the common toad Bufo bufo) in 42 ponds surrounded by different amounts of urban habitat (defined as towns, cities or villages). We also examined the association between Bd infections and a potential reservoir host species (the moor frog Rana arvalis). We found that 38% of the sites were positive for Bd with an infection prevalence of 4.4%. The extent of urban landscape was negatively correlated with Bd infection prevalence. However, the positive association of Bd with the presence of the possible reservoir species was substantially stronger than the urban effects. The body condition index of B. bufo was negatively associated with Bd infection. This Bd effect was stronger than the negative effect of urban landscape on body condition. Our results suggest that urban environments in Sweden have a negative impact on Bd infections, while the presence of the reservoir species has a positive impact on Bd prevalence. Our study also highlights the potential importance of Bd infection on host fitness, especially in rural landscapes.

AB  - Many hypotheses attempt to explain parasite-host associations, but rarely are they examined together in a single community. For hosts, key traits are the proportion of infected individuals (prevalence) and the diversity of parasites infecting them. A key parasite trait is host specificity, ranging from specialists infecting one or a few closely related species to generalists infecting many species. We tested 10 hypotheses to explain host-parasite associations; five 'host-centric' (e.g. prevalence is related to host abundance) and five 'parasite-centric' (e.g. parasite abundance is related to host specificity). We analyzed a community of 67 locally transmitted avian haemosporidian parasite lineages (genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus or Leucocytozoon), sampled from 2726 birds (64 species) in southern Sweden. Among host-centric hypotheses, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon prevalence and Haemoproteus diversity were related to host habitat preferences, whereas there were no relationships with host abundance or body mass. Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon prevalences were more similar among closely related than among distantly related host species. Haemoproteus prevalence and diversity were lower in host species with few close relatives ('evolutionarily distinct' hosts). Among parasite-centric hypotheses, most lineages, even relative generalists, infected closely related host species more often than expected by chance. However, the host species of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages overlapped less among lineages than expected by chance. Specialists did not reach higher prevalences than generalists on single host species. However, the abundance of Haemoproteus lineages was related to host specificity with generalists more common than specialists; this was driven by three closely related generalists. Host specificity of parasites was unrelated to the abundance or evolutionarily distinctiveness of their hosts. Parasite communities are likely structured by many factors and cannot be explained by hypotheses focusing solely on hosts or parasites. However, we found consistent effects of host phylogenetic relationships, plausibly a result of evolutionarily conserved host immune systems limiting parasite distributions.

AB  - Livestock farmers in Sweden usually grow feed grains for livestock but import protein feed from outside Sweden. Aside from the economic implications, some environmental issues are associated with this practice. We used life cycle assessment to evaluate the impact of local protein feed production on land use and greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the use of imported protein feed, for pig meat and dairy milk produced in Sweden. Our results showed that local production reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.5% and 12%, respectively, for pigs and dairy cows. Land use for feed production in Sweden increased by 11% for pigs and 25% for dairy cows, but total land use decreased for pig production and increased for dairy milk production. Increased protein feed cultivation in Sweden decreased inputs needed for animal production and improved some ecological processes (e.g. nutrient recycling) of the farm systems. However, the differences in results between scenarios are relatively small and influenced to an extent by methodological choices such as co-product allocation. Moreover, it was difficult to assess the contribution of greenhouse emissions from land use change. The available accounting methods we applied did not adequately account for the potential land use changes and in some cases provided conflicting results. We conclude that local protein feed production presents an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but at a cost of increasing land occupation in Sweden for feed production.

AB  - The two major aims of this study are (1) To test the performance of the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) to quantify past landscape changes using historical maps and related written sources, and (2) to use the LRA and map reconstructions for a better understanding of the origin of landscape diversity and the recent loss of species diversity. Southern Sweden, hemiboreal vegetation zone. The LRA was applied on pollen records from three small bogs for four time windows between AD 1700 and 2010. The LRA estimates of % cover for woodland/forest, grassland, wetland, and cultivated land were compared with those extracted from historical maps within 3-km radius around each bog. Map-extracted land-use categories and pollen-based LRA estimates (in % cover) of the same land-use categories show a reasonable agreement in several cases; when they do not agree, the assumptions used in the data (maps)-model (LRA) comparison are a better explanation of the discrepancies between the two than possible biases of the LRA modeling approach. Both the LRA reconstructions and the historical maps reveal between-site differences in landscape characteristics through time, but they demonstrate comparable, profound transformations of the regional and local landscapes over time and space due to the agrarian reforms in southern Sweden during the 18th and 19th centuries. The LRA was found to be the most reasonable approach so far to reconstruct quantitatively past landscape changes from fossil pollen data. The existing landscape diversity in the region at the beginning of the 18th century had its origin in the long-term regional and local vegetation and land-use history over millennia. Agrarian reforms since the 18th century resulted in a dramatic loss of landscape diversity and evenness in both time and space over the last two centuries leading to a similarly dramatic loss of species (e.g., beetles).

AB  - A multidisciplinary study of use by Sami people of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) inner bark was performed in northern Sweden. We combined linguistic, historical and archaeological records with ecological data collected from field studies to investigate important cultural and ecological factors associated with previous use of bark. Our data from bark peeled trees at 313 sites were used to describe patterns in space and time in the landscape. Sites with bark peeled trees were mainly found in the central and northern part of Lapland (65 degrees 00'-68 degrees 14'N). Large numbers of barked trees were found in undisturbed forests in national parks and reserves but few were Found in forests under commercial management. The dendroecological analysis revealed a continous use of inner bark from A.D. 1450 to 1890. Large sheets of bark were taken from trees in the spring, prepared and stored as a staple food resource. Inner bark was eaten fresh, dried or roasted. Smaller bark peelings were used for the wrapping of sinews. The cessation of bark use in the 19th century was driven by several Factors, but the availability of other products that could replace traditional use of bark was specifically important. The previous common and varied use of bark, the great age of Sami terminology and a possible association with archaeological remains of potential great age indicate that peeled bark was used long before the historic period. Our study also focused on the ongoing loss of culturally-modified trees in forests outside protected areas.

AB  - Forest management in Sweden today, as in many other places, involves the management of multiple resources for diverse purposes, such as promoting biodiversity, recreation, hunting, carbon sequestration, and reindeer herding as well as wood production. Sustainability is no longer related only to timber production; it now embraces the composition, processes, and functions of the entire ecosystem. Moreover, pressure from substitute products requires the production of timber, wood fuel, etc., to be economically competitive. The increased complexity of forest management has intensified the need for improved instruments for analysis and decision support. In response to this, a research programme aiming to develop new systems for forest management analysis and planning was recently initiated at the Forest Faculty, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), in which research efforts in different fields are being linked in a common framework to generate models and methods with the following desired attributes. The new systems should be designed with (i) a modular structure to allow the development of different applications, (ii) the landscape as the basic planning unit, (iii) the tree as the basic unit of projection of the tree layer, (iv) models of the interactions between processes and the management of the tree layer, and (v) models for evaluating risks and uncertainties in the data acquired and model projections. We believe that the separation of the system into a decision phase and a projection phase should facilitate the analysis of large and complex multiresource planning problems and suggest in this paper possible avenues for implementing such a feature. Since spatial problems are inherent in many biodiversity-related applications, we propose that appropriate spatially structuring principles should be included in the design of the system. The complex trade-offs involved when selecting ecosystem models in relation to the purpose of the analysis and data availability are highlighted.

AB  - Questions: Land-cover maps are used for nature management, but can they be trusted? This study addresses three questions: (1) what is the magnitude of between field worker inconsistencies in land-cover maps and what may cause such inconsistencies; (2) in which ways and to what extent do spatial scale and mapping system influence inconsistencies between maps; and (3) are some biomes mapped more consistently than others, and if so, why?
   Location: Gravfjellet, Oystre Slidre municipality, southern Norway.
   Methods: Two different mapping systems, designed for mapping at different spatial scales, were used for parallel mapping by three different field workers, giving a total of six maps for the study area. Spatial consistency of the resulting maps was compared at two hierarchical levels for both systems.
   Results: The average pair-wise spatial consistency at the highest hierarchical level was 83% for both systems, while the average pair-wise spatial consistency at the lowest hierarchical level was 60.3% for the coarse system and 43.8% for the detailed system. Inconsistencies between maps were partly caused by the use of different land-cover units and partly by spatial displacement.
   Conclusions: Field workers made different maps despite using the same mapping systems, materials and methods.

Consistency among field workers should be estimated as a standard quality indicator in all field-based mapping programmes.

AB  - Intra-species genetic homogenization arising from anthropogenic impacts is a major threat to biodiversity. However, few taxa have sufficient historical material to systematically quantify long-term genetic changes. Using archival DNA collected over approximately 100 years, we assessed spatio-temporal genetic change in Atlantic salmon populations across the Baltic Sea, an area heavily impacted by hydropower exploitation and associated with large-scale mitigation stocking. Analysis was carried out by screening 82 SNPs in 1680 individuals from 13 Swedish rivers. We found an overall decrease in genetic divergence and diminished isolation by distance among populations, strongly indicating genetic homogenization over the past century. We further observed an increase in genetic diversity within populations consistent with increased gene flow. The temporal genetic change was lower in larger wild populations than in smaller wild and hatchery-reared ones, indicating that larger populations have been able to support a high number of native spawners in relation to immigrants. Our results demonstrate that stocking practices of salmon in the Baltic Sea have led to the homogenization of populations over the last century, potentially compromising their ability to adapt to environmental change. Stocking of reared fish is common worldwide, and our study is a cautionary example of the potentially long-term negative effects of such activities.

AB  - Studies on the relation of the diversity of wood-decaying fungi to elevation are scarce, and their results are not consistent. We found that the elevation gradient and structural characteristics of a Picea abies forest underlie changes in the species richness and composition of wood-decomposing fungi. The occurrence of macrofungal sporocarps on logs on the ground was recorded over 3 years in 12 study plots (total area 2.4 ha) on a mountain slope (1,220-1,335 m) in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. The majority of species was more abundant in plots with a high mean volume of logs. The mean volume of logs was negatively related to elevation, which in turn had a negative influence on the occurrence of fungi. A negative relation of the high total volume of standing snags to the occurrence of fungi may be due to recent mortality caused by a bark beetle outbreak, albeit followed by the input of fresh logs that favoured a limited group of species. The diversity of fungi was also explained by the mean volumes of logs separated into decay classes. Numbers of red-listed species increased with the mean volume of logs and decreased with elevation. Large logs in later stages of decay provide essential habitat for the formation of sporocarps of red-listed species.

AB  - The development and deployment of Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is a cornerstone of the Norwegian government's climate strategy. A number of projects are currently evaluated/planned along the Norwegian West Coast, one at Tjeldbergodden. CO2 from this project will be utilized in part for enhanced oil recovery in the Halten oil field, in the Norwegian Sea. We study a potential design of such a system. A combined cycle power plant with a gross power output of 832 MW is combined with CO2 capture plant based on a post-combustion capture using amines as a solvent. The captured CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). We employ a hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) method to assess the environmental impacts of the system. The study focuses on the modifications and operations of the platform during EOR. We allocate the impacts connected to the capture Of CO2 to electricity production, and the impacts connected to the transport and storage Of CO2 to the oil produced. Our study shows a substantial reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions from power production by 80% to 75 g.(kW.h)(-1). It also indicates a reduction of the emissions associated with oil production per unit oil produced, mostly due to the increased oil production. Reductions are especially significant if the additional power demand due to EOR leads to power supply from the land.

AB  - Reindeer herding is an emblematic livelihood for Northern Finland, culturally important for local people and valuable in tourism marketing. We examine the livelihood resilience of Finnish reindeer herding by narrowing the focus of general resilience on social-ecological systems (SESs) to a specific livelihood while also acknowledging wider contexts in which reindeer herding is embedded. The questions for specified resilience can be combined with the applied DPSIR approach (Drivers; Pressures: resilience to what; State: resilience of what; Impacts: resilience for whom; Responses: resilience by whom and how). This paper is based on a synthesis of the authors' extensive anthropological fieldwork on reindeer herding and other land uses in Northern Finland. Our objective is to synthesize various opportunities and challenges that underpin the resilience of reindeer herding as a viable livelihood. The DPSIR approach, applied here as a three step procedure, helps focus the analysis on different components of SES and their dynamic interactions. First, various land use-related DPSIR factors and their relations (synergies and trade-offs) to reindeer herding are mapped. Second, detailed DPSIR factors underpinning the resilience of reindeer herding are identified. Third, examples of interrelations between DPSIR factors are explored, revealing the key dynamics between Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses related to the livelihood resilience of reindeer herding. In the Discussion section, we recommend that future applications of the DPSIR approach in examining livelihood resilience should (1) address cumulative pressures, (2) consider the state dimension as more tuned toward the social side of SES, (3) assess both the negative and positive impacts of environmental change on the examined livelihood by a combination of science led top-down and participatory bottom-up approaches, and (4) examine and propose governance solutions as well as local adaptations by reindeer herders as equally relevant responses to enhance livelihood resilience.

AB  - Aim Climate change and habitat loss are the main threats to forest biodiversity. Deadwood bryophyte communities are composed of species with different functional traits and are affected by these processes. Grouping species depending on their traits can help to anticipate community responses to global change, and to potential conservation actions. Location National scale of Sweden. Taxon Deadwood bryophyte species (15 liverworts and 8 mosses). Methods Generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to test for differences in projected relative changes in habitat suitability (matching species' requirements) among species with contrasting traits under varying climate and forest scenarios during the years 2020-2100. Projections were based on ensembles of species distribution models (GLM, Poisson point-process, MaxEnt), climate scenarios and national scenarios of forest management and conservation. Results Shoot length was the best predictor of projected future changes in habitat suitability. Habitat suitabilities for small, short-lived species will decline in a warmer and wetter macroclimate, whereas those for large, perennial species will increase. We expect stronger habitat suitability decreases for obligate than for facultative deadwood species. Increasing the proportion of set-aside forests from 16% to 32%, and reducing the harvest levels in production forests, mitigated negative habitat trends of several sensitive species. However, the potential benefits of increased conservation were even larger for species with traits favoured by climate change, suggesting that these actions will also enhance the spread of these species. Main conclusions Climate change is expected to lead to shifts in boreal bryophyte communities towards large, competitive species and to an overall decrease in diversity. High investment in conservation actions seems necessary to maintain diversity. This should include increasing the area of forest set aside beyond 16%, and reducing harvest levels in production forests. However, whilst these actions may prevent species extinctions, at least in the short term, changes in community structure seem inevitable.

AB  - Plant temperature responses vary geographically, reflecting thermally contrasting habitats and long-term species adaptations to their climate of origin. Plants also can acclimate to fast temporal changes in temperature regime to mitigate stress. Although plant photosynthetic responses are known to acclimate to temperature, many global models used to predict future vegetation and climate-carbon interactions do not include this process.
   We quantify the global and regional impacts of biogeographical variability and thermal acclimation of temperature response of photosynthetic capacity on the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle between 1860 and 2100 within a coupled climate-carbon cycle model, that emulates 22 global climate models.
   Results indicate that inclusion of biogeographical variation in photosynthetic temperature response is most important for present-day and future C uptake, with increasing importance of thermal acclimation under future warming. Accounting for both effects narrows the range of predictions of the simulated global land C storage in 2100 across climate projections (29% and 43% globally and in the tropics, respectively).
   Contrary to earlier studies, our results suggest that thermal acclimation of photosynthetic capacity makes tropical and temperate C less vulnerable to warming, but reduces the warming-induced C uptake in the boreal region under elevated CO2.

AB  - Anthropogenic mercury remobilization has considerably increased since the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s. The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a United Nations treaty (2017) aiming at curbing mercury emissions. Unfortunately, evaluating the effectiveness of such a global treaty is hampered by our inability to determine the lag in aquatic ecosystem responses to a change in atmospheric mercury deposition. Whereas past metal concentrations are obtained from core samples, there are currently no means of tracking historical metal bioavailability or toxicity. Here, we recovered DNA from nine dated sediment cores collected in Canada and Finland, and reconstructed the past demographics of microbes carrying genes coding for the mercuric reductase (MerA)-an enzyme involved in Hg detoxification-using Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. We found that the evolutionary dynamics of merA exhibited a dramatic increase in effective population size starting from 1783.8 +/- 3.9 CE, which coincides with both the Industrial Revolution, and with independent measurements of atmospheric Hg concentrations. We show that even low levels of anthropogenic mercury affected the evolutionary trajectory of microbes in the Northern Hemisphere, and that microbial DNA encoding for detoxification determinants stored in environmental archives can be used to track historical pollutant toxicity.

AB  - Despite the strong quantitative evidence that riparian zones (RZs) are the dominant source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to boreal streams, there is still a debate about the potential contribution of upslope areas to fluvial carbon export. To shed new light into this debate, we investigated the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in four upslope-riparian-stream transects in a Northern Swedish forest catchment using absorbance (A(254)/A(365) and SUVA(254)) and fluorescence (fluorescence and freshness indices) metrics. Based on these metrics, our results indicate that stream water DOM molecular composition resembles that of RZs and significantly differs from that of upslope areas. The resemblance between stream and riparian DOM was most apparent for the Dominant Source Layer (DSL), a narrow RZ stratum that, theoretically, contributes the most to solute and water fluxes to streams. Spectroscopic characterization based on traditional interpretations of the metrics suggested that mineral upslope (podzol) DOM is less aromatic, more microbially derived, and more recently produced than organic riparian (histosol) and stream DOM. We conclude that RZs, and specifically DSLs, are the main sources of DOC to boreal headwater streams and potentially to other streams located in low-gradient, organic matter-rich catchments.
   Plain Language Summary Understanding carbon cycling in natural ecosystems is critical because ongoing climate change can promote the release of previously stored carbon in forest soils to streams and rivers, with the potential to form carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. This is particularly important in boreal ecosystems, which are the largest stores of terrestrial carbon in the world. In this study, we identify the near-stream area, the so-called riparian zone, as the main source of carbon from boreal forest soils to streams. We provide qualitative data to support this, which together with previous quantitative analyses, make up enough evidence to support that the riparian zone is the main source of carbon to streams. As there is still a debate about the potential contribution of other areas in the ecosystem to the fluvial carbon export, our study importantly highlights that the riparian zone should be the focus of scientific assessments and management strategies in relation to carbon exports in surface waters.

AB  - Lichens have a vital role in forest ecosystems and they are a threatened group in boreal forests. However, the conservation ecology of the total lichen community has very rarely been studied. Here we studied lichen species and communities, including macrolichens (=foliose and fruticose growth forms) and rarely studied crustose li-chens, on decaying wood in boreal spruce-dominated forests in Finland. We also studied obligate lignicoles that grow only on dead wood and are mostly crustose in growth form. Species richness and community composition were examined on decaying logs and natural or cut stumps of Picea abies at different decay stages (2-5) in 14 stands, half of which were natural or seminatural and half recently managed. We used thorough search to yield a species list as close to complete as possible. Our study questions were: 1) Are species richness and lichen communities different in natural and managed forests, and if so, are there differences between macrolichens, crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles in how they respond to forest management? 2) How does the decay stage and dead wood type affect the lichens, i.e. are there differences between stumps and logs? We found a total of 127 lichen species. Most (75 %) of the recorded lichen species were crustose. With a generalized linear model we found that crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles had a higher species richness in natural than managed forests, but macrolichen richness was not significantly affected by forest management. Utilizing non-metric multidi-mensional scaling we discovered that site level community composition of macrolichens, crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles was also significantly different between natural and managed forests. We found that on dead wood unit level the decay stage had a significant effect on species richness and community composition, so that the species richness of all studied groups declined during the decay process. The dead wood type (stump vs log) had a significant effect on species richness of macrolichens and obligate lignicoles, both for which species richness was higher on logs than on stumps, as well as on the communities of crustose lichens.

AB  - The distribution and community assembly of above- and belowground microbial communities associated with individual plants remain poorly understood, despite its consequences for plant-microbe interactions and plant health. Depending on how microbial communities are structured, we can expect different effects of the microbial community on the health of individual plants and on ecosystem processes. Importantly, the relative role of different factors will likely differ with the scale examined. Here, we address the driving factors at a landscape level, where each individual unit (oak trees) is accessible to a joint species pool. This allowed to quantify the relative effect of environmental factors and dispersal on the distribution of two types of fungal communities: those associated with the leaves and those associated with the soil of Quercus robur trees in a landscape in southwestern Finland. Within each community type, we compared the role of microclimatic, phenological, and spatial variables, and across community types, we examined the degree of association between the respective communities. Most of the variation in the foliar fungal community was found within trees, whereas soil fungal community composition showed positive spatial autocorrelation up to 50 m. Microclimate, tree phenology, and tree spatial connectivity explained little variation in the foliar and soil fungal communities. Foliar and soil fungal communities differed strongly in community structure, with no significant concordance detected between them. We provide evidence that foliar and soil fungal communities assemble independent of each other and are structured by different ecological processes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine effects of clear-cutting and prescribed clear-cut burning on the abundance and diversity of soil meso- and macrofauna during the early (0-5 years) recovery/recolonisation phase. A 115-year-old stand of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in central Sweden was clear-cut in March 1999. Injune 1999, two plots on the clear-cut were burnt and two plots were left unburnt according to an experimental design with two blocks. Two plots of adjacent uncut forest were used as controls. The burning combusted the ground vegetation and the upper half of the 6-cm thick organic layer. In comparison with the unburnt clear-cut, burning decreased the abundances of Collembola, Protura, Mesostigmata, Araneae and Diptera larvae throughout the 5-year period, whereas Enchytraeidae, Lumbricidae, Oribatida, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Tardigrada decreased immediately after the fire but showed tendencies of recovery. Burning also decreased species richness. The majority of the species still absent after 5 years was surface-living species. Even animals with good ability to disperse (Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae) had not recovered, which indicates a change of habitat or lack of food. Clear-cut burning was particularly detrimental to fungivores and predators, whereas microbidetritivores and herbivores were less affected. Prescribed burning, which is considered to increase aboveground biodiversity, dramatically reduced the soil fauna species richness for at least 5 years and did not add any species to those already present in the forest or clear-cut.

AB  - Types of ectomycorrhizae were studied in soil cores from two different developmental phases in the permanent forest research plot in an autochtonous altimontane Norway spruce stand on Pokljuka (Triglav National Park, 1200m/s.l). Types of ectomycorrhizae were studied in soil cores of equal Volume (275ml, 0-18cm deep). 13 samples were taken from an old growth stand and 17 samples from a young regeneration center. In the samples all roots were counted and types of ectomycorrhizae briefly characterised. From 35.900 root tips ca 2% were not mycorrhizal and ca 58% were old unidentifiable types. 16 types of ectomycorrhizae could be identified by anatomical characteristics, but only 4 to the species level, and 8 types were preliminarily described. 20 ectomycorrhizal types belonged to the old growth stand and 10 types were described from young stand samples. 6 types of mycorrhizae occurred on both subplots. We conclude that both developmental phases of the spruce stand include highly diverse mycorrhizal components, which might have an influence on regeneration success of Norway spruce. For these cross-links to spruce regeneration, light dependent temperature regime and soil characteristics will be studied next.

AB  - The post-fire soil faunal communities are formed both by animals having survived the fire and by colonizers from the surrounding landscape. The relative impact of these processes is largely affected by fire intensity. However, with the same fire intensity, the severity of the fire and, thus, the survival of soil animals could vary depending on environmental heterogeneity. We hypothesized that much fewer soil animals would survive the same fire intensity on shallow, dry soils than on deep, moist soils. To clarify the impact of soil depth and moisture on animal survival after fire, we conducted a burning experiment in the laboratory. Soil samples containing indigenous populations of soil fauna were taken along two transects from the top, slope and foot of two respective rocky outcrops within a mixed coniferous forest in Central Sweden. Half of the samples were burnt and half were left unburnt. Burning depth varied between 24 mm (soils from the top of the gradient) to 12 mm (slope and foot soils) indicating a difference in flammability. The proportion of animals surviving fire seemed to be fairly independent of burning depth (42 to 62% survival rate). Contribution of eggs which survived fire in the soil to the overall animal abundance restoration was negligible (1-3%).
   A multi-trophic approach resulted in different sensitivity estimates to artificial burning of various parameters. Abundance and biomass of all fauna groups studied was more sensitive to fire than species richness. Collembolans and macrofauna predators were the groups most tolerant to fire, while oribatid mites and macrofaunal detritivores showed higher mortality after the fire treatment. Despite a more pronounced alteration of the components of soil food-web by burning in the lowland Sphagnum plots, they may be important as refugia, especially for more slowly moving soil-dwelling macro- and microarthropods.

AB  - Population growth is affected by several factors such as climate, species interaction and harvesting pressure. However, additional complexity can arise if fishing increases the sensitivity to environmental variability. To predict the effects of fisheries and climate on marine populations, there is a need for improved understanding of how they affect key ecological processes such as population growth. In this study, we used a comparative approach investigating commercially fished species across different ecosystems: the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea (Northeast Arctic cod), the North Sea (North Sea cod), the Atlantic Ocean (European hake), the Mediterranean Sea (European hake), and the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea (walleye pollock). Our objective was to compare the effects of commercial fisheries, age structure and environmental variability on population growth rate. We show that although all stocks experienced a decline in abundance, only 3 of them showed a concomitant decreasing trend in generation time (South Atlantic hake, North Atlantic hake and Northeast Arctic cod), suggesting a fishing-induced erosion in their age structure. Intra-specific analysis shows that changes in generation time triggered an increase in the relative contribution of recruitment to population growth. Furthermore, the contribution from recruitment to population growth changes due to large-scale climate indices or regional-scale environmental covariates, such as sea temperature. This study illustrates how and where the interaction between large-scale ecological patterns and regional/short-scale processes are important for designing management regulations.

AB  - Deep ploughing - which inverts, covers, or mixes soil organic layer (forest floor) and surface mineral A horizon into the mineral subsoil, burying the upper soil horizon in deeper layers, and disrupting pedogenic processes - is a debatable topic in forest plantation management. Overall, this review article aimed to identify the impacts of deep ploughing on the properties of forest plantations, adapting experiences from the agricultural sector. This paper examines the main impacts of deep ploughing technology on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, ground vegetation, and tree aboveground and belowground biomass in afforested former agricultural land. Analysis of the published literature shows that deep ploughing can be used under different climatic and soil conditions, but it induces site-specific changes in soil properties and vegetation. Mechanical site preparation during afforestation and reforestation should follow the requirements of sustainable soil management, to avoid negative effects on the environment and biodiversity. Based on this analysis, we suggest key indicators that may be specific to deep ploughing responses in afforested sites and can contribute to risk assessment, aimed at achieving sustainable forest management. To date, most studies on mechanical site preparation for forest plantation have been performed using a few conifer tree species; therefore, it is important to expand empirical studies.

AB  - Recently, the science and policy agenda on biodiversity moved to include ecosystem services assessments and it is recognised that for determining the effectiveness and progress of policy frameworks monitoring is crucial.
   Within European monitoring schemes, data. is collected following different sampling protocols for a range of biodiversity or context related aspects; from EU-wide general land cover mapping to red list species within Annex I habitats. In this paper, we analysed field instructions of seven monitoring schemes on the extent to which they can provide data on the provision of ecosystem services and what additional information may be needed for future monitoring of ecosystem services.
   We compared seven monitoring schemes (i.e. CORINE Land Cover, Land Use Cover Area Survey (LUCAS), European Biodiversity Observation Network (EBONE), biodiversity monitoring on organic and low-input farming systems (BioBio), National Inventory of the Landscape of Sweden (NILS) and Pan-European Common Birds Monitoring (PECBM) and UK Butterfly monitoring (UK-BM)) by scoring the quality of recorded parameters and the adequacy of sampling protocols for ecosystem service monitoring.
   All the examined schemes were able to provide some parameters on ecosystem services, but the quality of the parameters on average did not exceed the level of qualitative data. Additionally, the divergence between the sampling designs of the schemes and the spatial characteristics of ecosystem services reduced the potential monitoring value of all schemes. Monitoring schemes including a range of sampling methods, scales and included the recording of data on habitats, such as EBONE, BioBio and NILS, provided the best data on the provision of ecosystem services. We conclude that improvement of the monitoring of ecosystem services is hindered by several knowledge gaps: (I) a robust definition and conceptual framework of ecosystem services; (2) the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem services; and (3) the interpretation of monitoring data.
   In addition to ecosystem service monitoring, biodiversity monitoring unremittingly remains very important, at least to identify trade-offs between the management for services and the resulting biodiversity status. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative analyses of soft bottom invertebrate fauna from four Norwegian sill cords show increased macrofaunal abundance, species richness, and a considerably changed benthic deep water macrofaunal composition in the inner parts of the fjord system. In retrospect, the analyses show significantly altered benthic macrofaunal community structure that was not reflected by the changes in the Shannon-Wiener diversity indices during regular monitoring. The observed changes are mainly due to an increased abundance of opportunistic species, especially of the polychaete Polydora sp. during the last 10-15 years which is correlated significantly to declining dissolved oxygen, rising temperature in the bottom water and increasing total organic matter in the sediment. Possible anthropogenic and climatic impact factors related to the observed macrofaunal changes and environmental consequences of the changes are discussed.

AB  - Short rotation coppice (SRC) systems can play a role as feedstock for bioenergy supply contributing to EU energy and climate policy targets. A scenario depicting intensive arable crop cultivation in a homogeneous landscape (lacking habitat structures) was compared to a scenario including SRC cultivation on 20 % of arable land. A range of indicators was selected to assess the consequences of SRC on soil, water and biodiversity, using data from the Rating-SRC project (Sweden and Germany). The results of the assessment were presented using spider diagrams. Establishment and use of SRC for bioenergy has both positive and negative effects. The former include increased carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions as well as reduced soil erosion, groundwater nitrate and surface runoff. SRC can be used in phytoremediation and improves plant and breeding bird biodiversity (exceptions: grassland and arable land species) but should not be applied in dry areas or on soils high in toxic trace elements (exception: cadmium). The scenario-based analysis was found useful for studying the consequences of SRC cultivation at larger scales. Limitations of the approach are related to data requirements and compatibility and its restricted ability to cover spatial diversity and dynamic processes. The findings should not be generalised beyond the representativeness of the data used.

AB  - An approach to simplify the prediction of average aboveground forest biomass values and their associated variability is presented in this study. The advantage of the proposed approach is based on the fact that it can be applied to any form of equation describing tree size-shape relationships and to any tree species. The proposed approach was tested against a tree-level dataset comprising of 1211 pairs of aboveground tree biomass (M) and tree diameter (D) values. The compiled trees were grouped into several D classes and average M estimates (mu(M)) with their associated variances (sigma(M)) were predicted for each class based on second-order Taylor expansion formulas. Nineteen beech (Fagus moesiaca Cz.) plots were also used to derive mu(M) and sigma(M) estimates on an area basis in order to test the applicability of the approach on forest scale. The only assumption made was that the simple allometric model M = aD(b) can accurately describe the M-D relationship. The results indicated that the mere recording of D distribution and appropriate selection of a and b values may provide very good estimates for mu(M) and sigma(M) both at global and forest level. It is therefore concluded that biomass studies related to carbon sequestration, biofuel potential, ecophysiological processes and management practices are considerably simplified.

AB  - Bioenergy from boreal forests managed for productive purposes (e.g., pulp, timber) is commonly held to offer attractive options for climate change mitigation. However, this view has been challenged in recent years. Carbon balances, cumulative radiative forcing, and average global temperature change have been calculated for a variety of bioenergy management regimes in Swedish forests, and the results support the view that an increased use of forest biomass for energy in Sweden can contribute to climate change mitigation, although methodological (e.g., spatial scales) and parameter value choices influence the results significantly. We show that the climate effect of forest-based bioenergy depends on the forest ecosystems and management, including biomass extraction for bioenergy and other products, and how this management changes in response to anticipated market demands; and on the energy system effects, which determine the fossil carbon displacement and other greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation effects of using forest biomass for bioenergy and other purposes. The public and private sectors are advised to consider information from comprehensive analyses that provide insights about energy and forest systems in the context of evolving forest product markets, alternative policy options, and energy technology pathways in their decision-making processes.

AB  - Background: The species diversity of aphids and seasonal timing of their flight activity can have significant impacts on crop production, as aphid species differ in their ability to transmit plant viruses and flight timing affects virus epidemiology. The aim of the study was to characterise the species composition and phenology of aphid fauna in Finland in one of the northernmost intensive crop production areas of the world (latitude 64 degrees).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Flight activity was monitored in four growing seasons (2007-010) using yellow pan traps (YPTs) placed in 4-8 seed potato fields and a Rothamsted suction trap. A total of 58,528 winged aphids were obtained, identified to 83 taxa based on morphology, and 34 species were additionally characterised by DNA barcoding. Seasonal flight activity patterns analysed based on YPT catch fell into three main phenology clusters. Monoecious taxa showed early or middle-season flight activity and belonged to species living on shrubs/trees or herbaceous plants, respectively. Heteroecious taxa occurred over the entire potato growing season (ca. 90 days). Abundance of aphids followed a clear 3-year cycle based on suction trap data covering a decade. Rhopalosiphum padi occurring at the end of the potato growing season was the most abundant species. The flight activity of Aphis fabae, the main vector of Potato virus Y in the region, and Aphis gossypii peaked in the beginning of potato growing season.
   Conclusions/Significance: Detailed information was obtained on phenology of a large number aphid species, of which many are agriculturally important pests acting as vectors of plant viruses. Aphis gossypii is known as a pest in greenhouses, but our study shows that it occurs also in the field, even far in the north. The novel information on aphid phenology and ecology has wide implications for prospective pest management, particularly in light of climate change.

AB  - Research results on the structure of European OGF are often contradictory; while some researchers stress equilibrium structures, others suggest that this rarely happens due to biomass accumulation. If the former were the case, then there would be a fairly strong argument that OGF should serve as natural references for selection management. At the same time, mountain mixed selection forests are in many regions considered to be the most "natural" type of MF, and thus to a large extent similar to corresponding OGF. However, because there are few old-growth forests (OGF) left in Europe, comparisons between OGF and selection-managed forests (MF) are rare. Since nature-based silviculture should follow natural processes and not exclude any species from its natural range, in this study we compared two mixed OGF and neighboring MF (Piceo-Abieti-Fagetum illyricum) in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The MF were managed by the single-tree selection system for almost a century. The results indicated that this management approach yielded a statistically significant difference in tree species composition and presence of large-diameter trees. The cumulative diameter distributions, however, were similar in OGF and MF as both exhibited the shapes that are considered to provide demographic equilibrium. On the species level, though, this was the case only for beech. Species occurrence matrices indicated significant dominance of young European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees over silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in OGF. Nevertheless, based on the results from MF, the study highlights the crucial role of silvicultural measures that may potentially provide targeted long-term coexistence of the studied broadleaved and coniferous tree species.

AB  - European coastal heathlands are distinct ecosystems shaped by land use tradition and they have experienced an 80% area reduction from their historical maximum. These mosaics of mires and wind exposed patches have ericaceous shrub dominated vegetation, and soils within coastal heathlands are characterized by low pH and high levels of recalcitrant debris. Using a culture-based approach with molecular identification of isolates, we characterized root-associated fungal communities of six ericaceous species in eight heathland localities along Norway's western coast. Site-level alpha diversity ranged from 21-38 OTUs, while the total estimated gamma diversity for culturable heathland root fungi was 190-231 OTUs. Most species recovered are previously reported at low abundance in Norway, suggesting the biodiversity in this community is underreported, rather than novel for science. The fungi recovered were primarily Ascomycota, specifically endophytic Phialocephala, and Pezicula, and no host specificity was observed in the communities. The fungal communities exhibited high turnover and low nestedness, both between ericaceous hosts and across heathland sites. We observed no spatial patterns in fungal betadiversity, and this heterogeneity may be a product of the unique historic land use practices at each locality creating a distinct mycofloral "fingerprint". Robust diversity estimates will be key for managing fungal biodiversity in coastal heathlands. Our results indicate that sampling schemes that maximize the number of host plants sampled per site, rather than the number of cultures per plant yield improved alpha diversity estimates. Similarly, gamma diversity estimates are improved by maximizing the total number of localities sampled, rather than increasing the number of plants sampled per locality. We argue that while the current protected status of coastal heathland habitats and restoration efforts have knock-on effects for the conservation of fungal biodiversity, fungi have a vital functional role in the ecosystem and holistic conservation plans that consider fungal biodiversity would be beneficial.

AB  - Bioenergy expansion is present in most climate change mitigation scenarios. The associated large land use changes have led to concerns on how bioenergy can be sustainably deployed. Promising win-win strategies include the production of perennial bioenergy crops on recently abandoned cropland or on cropland prone to land degradation, as perennial crops typically reduce soil erosion rates. Natural vegetation regrowth is an alternative nature-based solution that can also co-deliver negative emissions and other environmental benefits. In this study, we explore the potential to deploy bioenergy crops in Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark) on abandoned cropland and on cropland threatened by soil erosion and compare the achievable climate change mitigation benefits with natural regrowth. We found 186 thousand hectares (kha) of abandoned cropland and 995 kha of cropland threatened by soil erosion suitable for bioenergy crop cultivation. The primary bioenergy potential in the region is 151 PJ (PJ) per year, corresponding to 67-110 PJ per year of liquid biofuels depending on biorefinery technology. This has a climate change mitigation potential from-6.0 to-17 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2eq) per year over the first 20 years (equivalent to 14-40% of annual road transport emissions), with high-end estimates relying on bioenergy coupled to carbon capture and storage (BECCS). On the same area, natural regrowth can deliver negative emissions of-10 MtCO2eq per year. Biofuel production outperforms natural regrowth on 46% of abandoned cropland with currently available biorefinery technologies, 83% with improved energy conversion efficiency, and nearly everywhere with BECCS. For willow windbreaks, improved biorefinery technology or BECCS is necessary to ensure the delivery of larger negative emissions than natural regrowth. Biofuel production is preferable to natural regrowth on 16% of croplands threatened by soil erosion with the current biorefinery technology and on 87% of the land area with BECCS. Without BECCS, liquid biofuels achieve larger climate benefits than natural regrowth only when bioenergy yields are high. Underutilized land and land affected by degradation processes are an opportunity for a gradual and more sustainable bioenergy deployment, and local considerations are needed to identify case-specific solutions that can co-deliver multiple environmental benefits.

AB  - The forest floor C stock needs to be accurately estimated in order to quantify its contribution to nutrient cycling and other ecological processes as well as for reporting purposes under international agreements. Hence, a modelling approach was used which involved testing three different types of models (GLM, GAM and random forest) to determine which one provided the best estimates of forest floor C stocks. The dataset employed contained over 1650 observations from different available sources embracing different climatic, topographic and biotic variables to be tested in the model. The approach that provided the best estimation of forest floor C stock was the random forest method, with forest type, latitude, altitude, canopy cover, mean summer temperature, annual accumulated temperature, summer precipitation, water deficit and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as co-variates. To obtain a robust forecast, several iterations of the model were performed to estimate forest floor C stocks from the mean of the predictions. The model estimated a forest floor C stock of 0.148 +/- 0.081 Pg, equivalent to a biomass of 0.381 +/- 0.214 Pg, for a wooded area of almost 184,000 km(2) in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands. The predictions were also presented in the form of a map showing the spatial distribution of the forest floor C stock. The results revealed a mean forest floor C stock of 8 Mg C ha(-1) for Spanish forests and identified differences between coniferous (10.1 Mg C ha(-1)) and hardwood forests (6.3 Mg C ha(-1)).

AB  - 1. Community assembly is affected by four processes: dispersal, filtering effects (selection), ecological drift and evolution. The role of filtering relative to dispersal and drift should decline with patch size, hampering possibilities to predict which organisms will be observed within small-sized patches. However, vegetation structure is known to have a marked impact on species assemblages, and plant quality may act as a biotic filter. This challenges the assumption of unpredictable species assemblages in small-sized vegetation patches. 2. Using 32 stands of five shrub species in south-west Finland, this study investigated whether biotic filtering effects caused by patch-forming plants are strong enough to overcome the mixing of mobile arthropod assemblages across small patches. 3. Stochastic variation did not hide the signals of biotic filtering and dispersal in the small shrub patches. Habitat richness around the patches explained a three times larger share of variation in the species composition than did the identity of the patch-forming plant, but it had less effect on the abundance of arthropods. A radius of 50-100 m around a patch explained the species composition best. 4. Abundance patterns varied between the feeding guilds; the patch-forming shrub influenced the abundances of detritivores and leaf-feeding herbivores, whereas the abundances of flower-visiting herbivores appeared to track the flowering phenology of the plants. Shrub identity had little effect on omnivores or predators. Predator abundances were correlated with the abundance of potential prey. 5. The results of this study suggest that community composition within a vegetation patch may be predictable even if dispersal overrides local filtering effects, as suggested by the mass-effects paradigm.

AB  - European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is an important driver of ecological processes in spruce stands, with severe effects on forestry economies. To prevent bark beetle outbreaks, early detection of infestations is a crucial step in forest management. It is expected that bark beetle infestation modifies biochemical composition of wood and needles, alters physiological responses in the early stage of infestation, which results in the reduction of tree growth and ultimately a tree death. Therefore, we studied the differences in biochemical composition of wood, content of photosynthesis-related pigments, shoot morphology, and growth between the healthy Siberian spruce trees (Picea obovata) and trees which were infested by I. typographus. The study was performed in five experimental plots established in the south of the Udmurt Republic in the European part of the Russian Federation. Three infested and three non-infested trees were chosen on each plot. Our results showed no significant effect of bark beetle infestation on the content of main structural components of wood - holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) and lignin. On the other hand, we found differences in the content of extractive substances in the wood. Specifically, we found a higher tannin content in the non-infested trees. The content of photosynthesis-related pigments differed between the non-infested and infested trees as well. Unexpectedly, bark beetle infestation caused the overproduction of both pigment types rather than their degradation. Moreover, we observed that a higher amount of total extractive substances positively affected the incremental growth, whereas tannins supported the growth of shoots and needles.

AB  - Until present, it has been challenging to turn the concept of ecosystem services into a practical tool in the formulation of day-to-day policies on a national or regional scale. This is largely due to the overarching nature of the concept of ecosystems services (ESs) and the lack of concrete ecosystem service typologies. In this paper, we describe the foundation process of a national ecosystem service indicator framework for Finland, beginning with the selection of nationally important ESs. We also evaluate how this set of national indicators could be scaled down to regional circumstances, or integrated in the international ecosystem assessment processes. Our aim was to develop a national framework that complies both with national circumstances and with international typologies such as the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and the cascade model. We developed indicators for 28 ecosystem services (10 provisioning, 12 regulating and maintenance, and 6 cultural services), a set of four indicators for every stage of the cascade model; altogether 112 indicators. We hope that the indicator framework draws attention to questions of resilience by providing information on the different aspects of ecosystem functioning that are crucial to the provisioning of ecosystem services. Furthermore, we hope to highlight the societal dependence on ecosystem services by providing indicators of both benefits and values. Besides higher-level decision-making processes, our attempt was to provide novel ecosystem service information for regional environmental managers and decision-makers, as well as the wider public interested in local issues. Integrating both ecological and socio-economic data into one platform may help to bridge the gap between science and practical decision-making resulting in more sustainable environmental management.

AB  - Although not without its critics, considerable recognition has been given to the climate cooling benefits provided by storing carbon from biomass in various storage pools. However, it has recently been found that depending on the storage pool/period and source of biomass, the associated climate impacts may be a burden or a benefit. It is important that carbon accounting schemes and life cycle assessment practitioners take these carbon/CO2 flux dynamics and the climate impacts that they create into consideration. In this work we illustrate these climate impacts with a Norwegian case study using a material flow analysis of the biogenic carbon in harvested wood products derived from a 2006 harvest year. We illustrate the dynamic carbon balance over time and show how the climate impacts can diverge greatly between two well-known climate impact metrics: global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP). We also show how these climate impacts can be attributed to contributing parties with an example of a glue laminated beam value chain which is stored in a long-lived building. We discuss the associated attribution issues that will inevitably arise and we offer recommendations on how best to minimize them.

AB  - The scientific community is working on ways to identify different ecosystem services and to bring them on par to allow tradeoff analysis and inform targeting of policies. However, those ultimately governing ecosystem services continue to base their decisions on traditional knowledge production segregated to specific habitats, ecosystems, geographical areas and sectors. The aim of our paper is to tackle the challenges of the transition from sector governance to a more integrated model of ecosystem service governance by building on existing governance arrangements geared towards sustainability. To examine the uptake of ecosystem service approaches, we review published material and conduct secondary analysis of how ecosystem services are identified, measured, mapped and valued in three Finnish real-world governance settings. The governance settings of voluntary biodiversity conservation, urban planning and natural resource strategies show that, at a qualitative level, identifying a broad range of ecosystem services is easy and appealing but cross-comparison and tradeoff analysis face challenges. The analysis demonstrates that measuring all services is impossible and faces difficulties where the services fall between traditional sectoral boundaries. Measuring and valuing services does not directly lead to increased use of this knowledge. We conclude that the mismatch between the governance needs and the ecosystem service paradigm can be closed only if the tools are developed so that they build on existing knowledge systems and governance arrangements but aim at communicating across ecosystem and sector boundaries.

AB  - Sooty blotch and flyspeck (SBFS) is a complex of at least 80 fungal species in 24 genera within the Dothideomycetes order Capnodiales. These epiphytes embed in the waxy epicuticle of apple fruit and colonies become visible in mid- to late summer. The blemished fruit are not marketable as fresh produce. Previous surveys of orchards in central and eastern USA and southern Europe found SBFS assemblages that were unique to geographic region. In the USA, SBFS species diversity was higher in orchards that received no fungicide sprays than those receiving fungicide sprays, suggesting that orchard management was an important determinant of SBFS species distribution and prevalence. To test the hypothesis that the composition of the SBFS complex is affected by geographic region and orchard management practices in Norway, 35 sites with a range of different management practices and cultivars were sampled. Colonies on each apple were counted according to the mycelial type, and subsamples of each mycelial type were amplified and sequenced using either primers specific to the rDNA of Capnodiales or a universal fungal primer pair for the large subunit of rDNA. Results indicated that a single genus was associated with each mycelial type. Seven genera known to cause SBFS were identified: Microcyclospora, Dissoconium, Peltaster, Microcyclosporella, Phaeothecoidiella, Schizothyrium, and Geastrumia. The percent composition of each site's SBFS assemblage was estimated to genus. Significant differences were found in SBFS assemblages among geographic districts and management practices, and there was a significant interaction of district and management. Organic orchards tended to have the least SBFS severity and genus diversity, whereas higher SBFS diversity tended to occur in abandoned than managed orchards. This is the first survey of SBFS fungi in apple orchards in Scandinavia.

AB  - Chequered blue butterfly, Scolitantides orion (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) has severely declined in many parts of Europe and is currently red-listed in many countries. We studied the population structure and turnover of the species in a lake-island system in a National Park in eastern Finland over a three-year period. The incidence of the chequered blue on the suitable islands (n = 41) and habitat patches (n = 123) was high: an average of 82% of the islands and patches were occupied over the three year period. At the island scale, the annual population turnover rate was 17%, with an extinction and colonization rate of 7% and 10%, respectively. At the patch scale, the annual population turnover was 16%, with 7% extinction and 9% colonization rate. Islands that were occupied over the three year period had a larger area of suitable habitat than islands in which turnover events were observed. At the patch scale, turnover events were observed in small and poorly connected patches. Patchy occurrence of the host plant and observed extinction-colonization dynamics suggest that the chequered blue population confirms a metapoputation structure. Although the local populations are small, the observed high patch occupancy and balanced population turnover indicates that the metapopulation is not in immediate risk of extinction.

AB  - 1. Aquatic communities are structured by multiple forces, and identifying the driving factors over multispatial scales is an important research issue. The East Asian monsoon region is globally one of the richest environments in terms of biodiversity, and is undergoing rapid human development, yet the river ecosystems in this region have not been well studied. We applied a hierarchical framework to incorporate regional and local environmental effects on stream macroinvertebrate communities in this region. The knowledge gained is expected to improve the understanding of the importance of spatial scale on regional and local diversity in the East Asian monsoon region. 2. A national data set of benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables (geographical, land-use, hydrological, substratum and physicochemical elements) in Korean rivers was used to determine the habitat preferences of macroinvertebrates. 3. Latitude, proportion of forest coverage, riffle habitat, silt substratum and temperature were the most important determinants for the ordinations of macroinvertebrate communities in each category evaluated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The optimal habitats for stream macroinvertebrates are not the same for all species, and overall community metrics and abundance of sensitive species tended to be lower in open agricultural and urban streams than in forested streams. The sensitivity of mayflies and stoneflies to anthropogenic disturbances implicated them as good indicators to assess the effects of urban and agricultural activities. 4. A partial CCA was used to evaluate the relative importance of macrohabitat and microhabitat variables on community composition at three spatial scales (whole country, the large Han River basin and two small sub-basins in the lowlands and highlands). The majority of community variation (1722% for each environmental element) was explained by macrohabitat variables at the regional spatial scale. In contrast, large proportions (1518%) were explained by microhabitat variables at the local spatial scale. 5. Our findings indicate that the relative importance of habitat scales should be determined by geographical size and that comprehensive understanding of multispatial scale patterns can be important for implementing sound biodiversity conservation programmes.

AB  - In human dominated landscapes many diverse, and often antagonistic, human activities are intentionally and inadvertently determining the supply of various ecosystem services. Understanding how different social and ecological factors shape the availability of ecosystem services is essential for fair and effective policy and management. In this paper, we evaluate how well alternative social-ecological models of human impact on ecosystems explain patterns of 16 ecosystem services (ES) across the 62 municipalities of the Norrstrom drainage basin in Sweden. We test four models of human impact on ecosystems, land use, ecological modernization, ecological footprint, and location theory, and test their ability to predict both individual ES and bundles of ES. We find that different models do best to predict different types of individual ES. Land use is the best model for predicting provisioning services, standing water quality, biodiversity appreciation, and cross-country skiing, while other models work better for the remaining services. However, this range of models is not able to predict some of the cultural ES. ES bundles are predicted worse than individual ES by these models, but provide a clear picture of variation in multiple ecosystem services based on limited information. Based on our results, we offer suggestions on how social-ecological modeling and assessments of ecosystems can be further developed.

AB  - Dead wood is one of the most important indicators of forest naturalness and the most important manageable habitat for biodiversity in forests. Standing and lying dead wood, and especially coarse woody debris, plays an important part in creating habitats for many highly specialized organisms, e.g., insects, fungi, lichens and bacteria. Temperate mixed deciduous forests, rich in species, have been studied only to a small extent from the point of view of the ecology of wood-related cryptogams. Our study aimed at the reduction of the gap in knowledge about the ecological characteristics of dead wood-dependent organisms by focusing on species of cryptogams developing on various dead wood structures typical of temperate non-beech forests. Studies were performed in forests located in Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Russia. We recorded 48 species of cryptogams: 18 species of bryophytes, 24 species of fungi and 6 species of lichens developing on dead wood. Our study stresses the importance of all types of dead wood as a substrate for the development of rare cryptogam species. Logs were the most important substratum type for cryptogams, followed by snags, dead trees and stumps. The cryptogam species richness on logs was several times higher than on the three other types of substrata. Coarse logs of intermediate decay stages hosted the highest number of cryptogams, followed by freshly fallen logs and, finally, well decayed logs. Assessing the importance of dead wood quality for the studied cryptogams, we found that intermediate decay stages are extremely important for fungi, while bryophytes or lichens do not show a clear preference. The highest number of cryptogams was found on Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur and Picea abies, while other tree species had less than half cryptogam species.

AB  - European beech plays a prominent role in the adaptation of European forests to and mitigation of climate change. Forest management may increase the mitigation potential of beech forests by accelerating carbon accumulation in tree biomass, but little is known about the interaction between the rate of biomass expansion in beech and its sensitivity to climate variation or its resistance to extreme drought episodes. A 60-year thinning experiment in beech forests in Central Europe was used to generate tree-ring width series describing past radial growth of dominant, co-dominant and sub-dominant beech trees. Randomisation applied to daily climate data was used to find the period of the year during which climate best explains beech growth. Results show that carbon uptake by above-ground biomass is higher in unmanaged stands and that thinning does not affect beech growth sensitivity to climate. Further, this study shows that average daily temperature amplitude and precipitation in March-July are the best predictors of radial growth in beech at lower-elevation sites. In a key finding, this research shows that site quality and thinning intensity increase tree size, which in turn lowers their resistance to drought. Using forest management to increase the productivity of European beech may thus increase its vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - The natural preindustrial ANC and pH decline associated with 22 melt events from 11 streams during spring flood of 1997 and 1998 in Northern Sweden have been assessed using the Boreal Dilution Model (BDM). The results show that the spring flood pH decline of 0.5 to 2.5 pH units in the streams was largely caused by natural processes. The most important driving factors influencing pH were TOC increase in combination with ANC dilution. The study also demonstrates that pH in some streams can decline to pH values close to 4.5 as a result of natural processes alone. In general the anthropogenic component of the pH decline was between 0.1 and 0.3 pH units superimposed on the natural pH decline. Furthermore, the anthropogenic contribution to ANC and pH decline generally followed the gradient of anthropogenic S deposition in the region. The sites with the greatest inferred anthropogenic influence are also those for which the assumptions used in the BDM were most sensitive. Nevertheless, the results from this study suggest that the regional impact of anthropogenic acid deposition on the ANC and pH in northern Sweden is currently limited.

AB  - This study focuses on developing a possible architecture of planned industrial symbiosis in Sodankyl, Finland. The municipality of Sodankyl is considering the establishment of new businesses to boost the region's local economy. The preliminary assessment presented here evaluates some new markets, including combined heat and power plants, a biogas reactor, greenhouse farm, fish farm and several insect farms. These businesses should be able to fulfil the criteria of sustainability and circular economy. This study proposes an architecture where companies can quantify the value and the cost of material exchange. The combined life cycle cost and the net present value of symbiosis are estimated at (sic)93 and (sic)43 million respectively. The combined life cycle cost of waste management is calculated to be (sic)6.40 million. The study's novelty is its projection of the quantified cost of bio-waste and recyclable waste of industries, highlighting the monetary value of industrial symbiosis where waste products can turn into industries' raw material. The value gained and cost reduced by such symbiosis is forecast at 14.65% and 6.8% respectively.

AB  - Large carnivores play a key ecological role in nature, yet quantifying the effects of predation at large spatiotemporal scales remains challenging. Wolves and brown bears have recovered in Sweden, where they share the same staple prey, moose. This ecosystem is representative of the Eurasian boreal realm, and makes an interesting case study for exploring the use of hunter-collected observation data to understand the ecological effects of large carnivore recovery in human-dominated ecosystems. We used over 50 million hours of moose observation data collected by "citizen scientists" (i.e., moose hunters) between 2000 and 2017 to evaluate the role of recovering bear and wolf populations on an important ungulate vital rate, calf/cow ratio (the number of observed calves per female in fall). Calf/cow ratios were negatively correlated with both wolf and bear densities, suggesting that summer calf survival decreased via predation. Calf/cow ratios decreased by 7% and 17% in the northern and southern areas where bears and wolves were allopatric, respectively. Where wolves and bears were sympatric, the effect of predator densities was additive; calf/cow ratios decreased by 18%. However, both calf/cow ratios and moose densities declined over the last similar to 20 years across Sweden, including areas where wolves and bears were absent. While recolonizing large carnivores affected ungulate vital rates in Sweden's human-dominated landscape, they were likely not the primary driver of long-term moose population trends. Our results reinforce that citizen-collected data are a useful wildlife monitoring tool that help understand ecological processes, including the effects of recovering carnivores on prey populations.

AB  - Large-scale deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is part of the pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C and yet, negative public perceptions of CCS have challenged the realization of several projects in Europe over the last decade. This study is the first to look at the effect of exporting or importing CO2 on public perceptions. We conducted a fractional factorial survey experiment in Germany and Norway varying the nationality of the CO2 source and of the storage site of a hypothetical CCS project. We find that respondents from both countries do not evaluate offshore and onshore storage differently but otherwise we find substantial differences between countries. Norwegian respondents react to the experimental manipulation: despite an overall more positive attitude toward CCS, they evaluate a project where foreign sourced CO2 is stored in Norway substantially more negatively compared to a project where domestically sourced CO2 is stored in Norway. By contrast, German respondents are not affected by the variation of the nationality of emissions or the storage site. We connect this finding to construal level theory, arguing that Germans are more psychologically distanced from CCS than Norwegians due to differences in general familiarity with CCS and the political support for CCS; this makes them less sensitive to our experimental manipulation. The uncovered decrease in public support for CCS when CO2 is exported from Germany to Norway challenges the feasibility of the current plans of Northern European states for a CO2 transport and storage infrastructure.

AB  - A successful crop rotation choice is key to the profitability and sustainability of farm management and may simultaneously have an impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) content. In this study, we estimated how changes in crop rotations affected SOC balance in Finland between 2009 and 2018, using geospatial data and Bayesian modeling. The area designated for perennial-dominated and diverse cereal rotations increased over the study period. Perennial grassland rotation was found to have a positive impact on SOC balance, while rotations dominated by annual crops did not differ in their impacts on SOC content. At the national scale, changes in Finnish crop rotations resulted in an estimated annual mitigation of the loss of SOC content by 1336 Mg C year-1 in mineral soils and reduced the carbon dioxide emissions of organic soils by 10,475 Mg C year-1. The combined effect of these two contributions is 11,811 Mg C year-1, with an 80% probability interval of (-6600; 30,300) Mg C year-1. While the overall impact of changes in crop rotations on SOC is relatively small, a continued change to more diverse and perennial-dominated crop rotations may have other agronomic and environmental benefits, e.g. on resilience and biodiversity.

AB  - Primary forests are characterized by high vertical and horizontal stand diversity, which provides habitat for a diverse range of species with complex habitat requirements. Detailed knowledge of related ecological processes and habitat development of primary forest species are essential to inform forest management and biodiversity conservation decisions, but relationships are not well documented. We collected dendrochronological data and inventoried numerous structural elements in permanent plots throughout the primary temperate forests within the Carpathian Mountains. We fit and compared multiple predictive models to quantify the importance of 200 years of natural disturbance dynamics on the occurrence probability of an umbrella species the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). We showed that a mixed-severity disturbance regime ranging from low through moderate to high severity disturbances is required to generate diverse forest habitats suitable for capercaillie. The variation in natural disturbance severity and its timing promoted key structural habitat elements, such as low natural regeneration density, low mature tree density, high ground vegetation cover, availability of forest gaps, and abundance of standing deadwood. This study demonstrates the importance of natural disturbance in maintaining the variety of conditions necessary to support primary forest specialist species. Managers of protected areas should be mindful that natural disturbances generate habitat for the capercaillie in mountain Norway spruce forests. Further intervention is unnecessary. Conservation planning and forest reserve design should shift focus to the large-scale spatial requirements needed to ensure that a wide range of forest developmental phases are represented in protected areas.

AB  - In the Baltic Sea, species diversity is relatively low and the introduction of new predator species can have large direct and indirect impacts on native species - both prey and potential competitors. The alien round goby Neogobius melanostomus Pallas, 1811 was introduced to the Baltic Sea in the early 1990s and is now well-established. We examined the feeding habits of male round gobies from the Aland Islands, Finland, where round gobies were first recorded in 2011. Specifically, we tested whether small round gobies (<= 165 mm TL) showed size and/or species preferences (using Manly's selectivity index) for two abundant bivalve prey items, the blue mussel Mytilus trossulus Gould, 1850 and the Baltic clam Macoma balthica Linnaeus, 1758. When offered two sizes of clams, small round gobies did not show a prey preference. When offered two sizes of mussels, round gobies selected for small mussels (6 - 9 mm) and against large (10 - 13 mm) mussels. When offered both bivalve species and sizes simultaneously (four prey options), round gobies selected for small blue mussels and against large clams. Combined, these results suggest that small round gobies will selectively feed on the preferred prey if available and if not, their feeding will reflect the availability of various prey items in the environment. In addition, round gobies consumed small (<= 38 mm TL) individuals of the native flounder Platichthys flesus Linnaeus, 1758. Round goby and flounder have the potential to overlap in habitat use and previous literature has suggested a diet overlap between the two; however, this is the first evidence of direct predation on flounder by round gobies.

AB  - Forest management has caused severe ecological degradation throughout the Globe. One of its most prominent consequences is the drastic change in dead wood profile and consequently in the dead wood dependent biota. Wood-inhabiting fungi are, considering ecosystem functions, the most important species group utilizing dead wood, because they take care of majority of the decaying process. The earlier research focusing on the effects of forest management on wood-inhabiting fungi has strongly focused on large dead wood pieces (i.e. coarse woody debris, CWD), even though it has been shown that a major part of fungal diversity utilizes (also) small dead wood pieces (i.e. [very] fine woody debris, [V]FWD). In this paper, we studied the effects of earlier forest management on the wood-inhabiting fungi occupying all dead wood diameter fractions including the smallest pieces. The study was conducted in boreal pine and spruce dominated forests in Finland. Altogether we surveyed corticioid and polyporoid fungi from 113,269 dead wood pieces in 8 previously managed and 8 natural forests. The composition of fungal community varied between the forest types (pine vs. spruce; managed vs. natural) and according to the diameter of the dead wood substrate. However, the fungal diversity occupying CWD, and some diameter fractions of FWD, was clearly lower in managed than natural spruce dominated forests. Moreover, most of the rare species were detected only in natural forests, especially spruce dominated, and based on the species accumulation curves these sites were also the ones where largest proportion of community remained undetected. The effects of earlier forest management are evident also in fungal communities occupying FWD. The effects are, however, clearly stronger in CWD and especially in spruce dominated forests. Consequently, the main focus in forest conservation and restoration efforts may still be targeted on increasing CWD volume in managed landscapes, but simultaneously attention must be targeted on retaining reasonable volume of FWD to ensure that the species specialized in utilizing it will not be driven to local extinctions. Combining this recommendation with increasing pressure for energy wood harvesting will remain as a challenge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the Three Gorges Project (TGP) may have affected the population structure and distribution of plant and animal communities, few studies have analyzed the effect of this project on small mammal communities. Therefore, the present paper compares the small mammal communities inhabiting the beaches of Dongting Lake using field investigations spanning a 20-year period, both before and after the TGP was implemented. Snap traps were used throughout the census. The results indicate that the TGP caused major changes to the structure of the small mammal community at a lake downstream of the dam. First, species abundance on the beaches increased after the project commenced. The striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) and the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), which rarely inhabited the beach before the TGP, became abundant (with marked population growth) once water was impounded by the Three Gorges Reservoir. Second, dominant species concentration indices exhibited a stepwise decline, indicating that the community structure changed from a single dominant species to a more diverse species mix after TGP implementation. Third, the regulation of water discharge release by the TGP might have caused an increase in the species diversity of the animal community on the beaches. A significant difference in diversity indices was obtained before and after the TGP operation. Similarity indices also indicate a gradual increase in species numbers. Hence, a long-term project should be established to monitor the population fluctuations of the Yangtze vole (Microtus fortis), the striped field mouse and the Norway rat to safeguard against population outbreaks (similar to the Yangtze vole outbreak in 2007), which could cause crop damage to adjacent farmland, in addition to documenting the succession process of the small mammal community inhabiting the beaches of Dongting Lake.

In the Fennoscandian boreal region, forestry with clearcutting is a threat to biodiversity causing the loss of mature forest elements and deterioration of ecological processes in forest landscapes, ultimately affecting PAs via declined structural connectivity. This paper aims to (1) determine PAs with high, red-listed species concentrations; (2) estimate the change in forest habitat around these PAs on different spatial scales; and (3) determine if forest management intensity is higher around biologically most valuable PAs. Occurrences of red-listed forest-dwelling species in Finland were used to identify PAs harbouring these species and to produce site-specific importance indices. CORINE landcover data was used as a baseline for the distribution of forests to assess the cover of clear-cuttings from 2001 to 2019 with the Global Forest Change (GFC) data set in three buffer areas around the PAs with occurrences of red-listed species. Results The largest proportion of clear-cuts occurred in 1 km and 10 km buffers around the PAs in the southern and middle boreal zones, being ca. 20%. This indicates that the forest habitat is degrading fast at regional and landscape levels. On the positive side, the change in forest cover was lower around the biologically most important PAs compared to other PAs with red-listed species. Conclusions Open and free satellite-data based assessments of the cover and change of forests provide reliable estimates about the rates at which mature and old-growth forests are being converted into young managed ones in Finland mainly via clear-cuts on different scales around PAs. The rate of clear-cuts was lowest in adjacent buffer areas next to the most species-rich PAs, which provides opportunities for biodiversity conservation efforts to be targeted to the remaining mature and old-growth forests found in the vicinity of these areas.

AB  - Ongoing urban exploitation is increasing pressure to transform urban green spaces, while there is increasing awareness that greenery provides a range of important benefits to city residents. In efforts to help resolve associated problems we have developed a framework for integrated assessments of ecosystem service (ES) benefits and values provided by urban greenery, based on the ecosystem service cascade model. The aim is to provide a method for assessing the contribution to, and valuing, multiple ES provided by urban greenery that can be readily applied in routine planning processes. The framework is unique as it recognizes that an urban greenery comprises several components and functions that can contribute to multiple ecosystem services in one or more ways via different functional traits (e.g. foliage characteristics) for which readily measured indicators have been identified. The framework consists of five steps including compilation of an inventory of indicator; application of effectivity factors to rate indicators' effectiveness; estimation of effects; estimation of benefits for each ES; estimation of the total ES value of the ecosystem. The framework was applied to assess ecosystem services provided by trees, shrubs, herbs, birds, and bees, in green areas spanning an urban gradient in Gothenburg, Sweden. Estimates of perceived values of ecosystem services were obtained from interviews with the public and workshop activities with civil servants. The framework is systematic and transparent at all stages and appears to have potential utility in the existing spatial planning processes. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Canadian horticultural peat industry generates carbon emissions through various methods of peat extraction, processing, and land-use changes. This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO(2) equivalents (CO(2)-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO(2)-e) and BC (29 000 t CO(2)-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.

AB  - This paper aims to set the scene for the session by elaborating on the challenges of modelling issues of integrated nitrogen management. Reactive nitrogen (Nr) plays a vital role in different areas, such as air pollution, climate change, eutrophication and acidification of soils, ecosystems and surface waters and such like. It inherently presents a multi-pollutant, multi-effect and multi-media problem.
   Historically, many of these individual problems have been addressed by models developed for a specific purpose, limited to single pollutants, effects or environmental compartments and media. In addition to that, relevant datasets and model approaches have been developed within different scientific and science-policy communities and hence their integration is facing not only technical and methodological problems, but as well needs communication and collaboration across disciplines, in many areas outside the comfort zones of modellers and decision makers alike.
   While climate change and carbon have been receiving a significant amount of attention in science, policy and the general public in the course of the last decade, the changes of the global nitrogen cycle and its implications have emerged to - potentially - become an even greater challenge for science An ever ongoing increase in vehicular traffic, energy use, industry, and animal husbandry are the principal causes of the increased emissions of oxidized and reduced forms of nitrogen. The negative impacts of these emissions include: (i) air pollution, such as increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone and fine particles, leading to effects on humans and vegetation and influencing the earth's radiation balance, (ii) elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), being one of the most important greenhouse gases, thus affecting climate change and to climate change, (iii) eutrophication and acidification of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with related impacts on plant species and faunal species diversity, (iv) surface water pollution with nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4), including damage to fisheries in coastal ecosystems and (v) drinking water (ground water) pollution by nitrate pollution (e. g. Vitousek et al., 1997, Galloway and Cowling, 2002; Galloway et al., 2003; Matson et al., 2002;) The undesirable "cascading effects" of nitrogen, as Galloway et al. (2003) call them, thus affect different environmental media, across different time spans and different nitrogen species contribute to most contemporary environmental pressures. It is thus a formidable example for taking stock of the methods and approaches which form the state-of-the-art in environmental modelling and how they may be integrated and combined to tackle the nitrogen problem.
   The relevance of nitrogen and the need for an integrated approach to address the complex issues of managing the nitrogen cycle have recently been highlighted at the 3(rd) of a series of workshops organised by the Swedish ASTA programme (http://asta.ivl.se/Saltsjobaden3.htm). It is anticipated, that under the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) the development of strategies to address the nitrogen challenge will have a prominent role in the coming years.
   The paper will discuss some approaches currently taken in research projects in Europe, e. g. the NitroEurope IP (http://www.nitroeurope.eu, in particular the work on the INTEGRATOR model), the IIASA RAINS/GAINS model (http://www.iiasa.ac.at/rains/gains/) and link to discussions and developments on concepts for model integration and coupling such as OpenMI (http://www.openmi.org/). It will present an overview and aims to inspire the discussion within the session and beyond.

AB  - Although the nature/culture dichotomy has been extensively criticized by scholars, it remains pervasive to our conception of the world. Discourses of nature as a pristine milieu and of culture as a realm of human dominance not only impact cognition, but also the local practices of those involved daily in such contested areas. In this study of the mountainous area of the Jamtland County, Sweden, we report on the ways local stakeholders make sense of their surrounding landscape in the wake of its magnificent character as they go about their daily lives as residents, entrepreneurs and recreationists. We turn to the notion of dwelling to frame these narratives. This ultimately becomes an exploration of the contradictions and confusions within and between the discourses of conservation, management, recreation, authenticity and tourism development that affect how local stakeholders consciously and subconsciously cope with the tensions brought about by the nature/culture dichotomy. The findings are used to propose a critical, as well as constructive, notion of dwelling that stresses the importance of opening up to new possibilities and responsibilities during negotiations over protected areas.

AB  - Shallow bays with soft sediment bottoms are common habitats along the Swedish and Finnish Baltic Sea coastline. These bays undergo a process of geomorphometric evolution with the natural isostatic land-uplift process, whereby open bays and sounds decrease in depth and are gradually isolated from the sea, forming bays with narrow openings. This study tested the relationship between the morphometric isolation of the bays from the sea and the macroinvertebrate fauna community of these bays. Additionally, we tested the specific role of the submerged vegetation as an indicator of the macroinvertebrate fauna community. We chose two environmental factors for the analyses, water exchange of the bays and the taxon richness of the macroflora in the bays. We found a hierarchical relationship between water exchange, flora taxon richness, and fauna biomass and taxon richness using structural equation modelling: decreased biomass and taxon richness of fauna were related to decreased flora taxon richness, which in turn was related to decreased water exchange. Using multivariate redundancy analysis, the two environmental factors included in the model were found to explain 47.7% of the variation in the fauna taxon composition and 57.5% of the variation in the functional feeding groups of the fauna. Along the morphometric isolation gradient of the bays, the fauna assemblages changed from a community dominated by gastropods, bivalves, and crustaceans, to a community mainly consisting of a few insect taxa. Moreover, the proportion of predators, gathering collectors, and shredders increased while that of filtering collectors and scrapers decreased. Our results indicate that the density and taxon richness of macroinvertebrate fauna are higher in less morphometrically isolated bays than in more isolated bays in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, we suggest that the taxon richness of macroflora can serve as an indicator of the fauna community. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

AB  - Adapting the current management of marine resources to align with an ecosystem-based approach is becoming increasingly common. Understanding the communities within an area-their species and distribution-is crucial to managing marine activities whilst maintaining ecological function. We performed a broad-scale community analysis of the demersal assemblages of the western English Channel and Celtic Sea. The diversity of the study area was investigated through K-means cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, diversity indices and discussion in relation to relevant environmental variables. The demersal species studied formed 7 distinct demersal assemblages, broadly aligned with environmental variables such as natural disturbance and substrate. Several assemblages were defined by notable characterising species, including Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus in the Celtic Sea, queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis in the central western English Channel and boarfish Capros aper off the coast of the Cornish peninsula and the Isles of Scilly. The area of the central English Channel dominated by queen scallop had lower diversity relative to neighbouring demersal assemblages. This study provides the most spatially comprehensive delineation of demersal assemblage structure for this region, and is an example of the spatial analyses needed to inform future biodiversity monitoring and marine spatial planning, which are both key aspects of an ecosystem-based approach for the management of human activities in marine waters.

AB  - The mycobiome, comprising fungi inhabiting plants, potentially plays a crucial role in tree health and survival amidst environmental stressors like climate change and pathogenic fungi. Understanding the intricate relationships between trees and their microbial communities is essential for developing effective strategies to bolster the resilience and well-being of forest ecosystems as we adopt more sustainable forest management practices. The mycobiome can be considered an integral aspect of a tree's biology, closely linked to its genotype. To explore the influence of host genetics and environmental factors on fungal composition, we examined the mycobiome associated with phloem and roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) cuttings under varying watering conditions. To test the "mycobiome-associated-fitness" hypothesis, we compared seedlings artificially inoculated with Heterobasidion parviporum and control plants to evaluate mycobiome interaction on necrosis development. We aimed to 1) identify specific mycobiome species for the Norway spruce genotypes/families within the phloem and root tissues and their interactions with H. parviporum and 2) assess stability in the mycobiome species composition under abiotic disturbances (reduced water availability). The mycobiome was analyzed by sequencing the ribosomal ITS2 region. Our results revealed significant variations in the diversity and prevalence of the phloem mycobiome among different Norway spruce genotypes, highlighting the considerable impact of genetic variation on the composition and diversity of the phloem mycobiome. Additionally, specific mycobiome genera in the phloem showed variations in response to water availability, indicating the influence of environmental conditions on the relative proportion of certain fungal genera in Norway spruce trees. In the root mycobiome, key fungi such as Phialocephala fortinii and Paraphaeosphaeria neglecta were identified as conferring inhibitory effects against H. parviporum growth in Norway spruce genotypes. Furthermore, certain endophytes demonstrated greater stability in root ecosystems under low water conditions than ectomycorrhizal fungi. This knowledge can contribute to developing sustainable forest management practices that enhance the well-being of trees and their ecosystems, ultimately bolstering forest resilience.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity can lead to deforestation and subsequent dramatic impacts on forest-dwelling animal species. In this study, we investigated the habitat use of a forest raptor (Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus) in an air-polluted area of the Ore Mountains (Czech Republic) that has been restored by non-native spruce. Based on a 14-year Tengmalm's Owl nest-box breeding dataset, we found that the percentage of native Norway Spruce forest was higher for occupied nest boxes than for unoccupied ones within close surroundings of the nest (buffer radius of 25 m). Meanwhile, the percentage of non-native Blue Spruce (originally from Northern America) was higher for occupied nest boxes than for unoccupied ones within the home-range breeding area (buffer radius of 750 m). Moreover, the surroundings of non-predated nests (radius of 750 m) showed a higher percentage of Blue Spruce and a lower percentage of deciduous trees than surroundings of nests predated by Pine Martens. Although small mammal availability was not affected by habitat categories, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of Apodemus mice in the diet of owls and the percentages of both Blue Spruce and open forest area within the foraging area radius (750 m). We suggest that adult owls and young fledglings use remnants of tall, old-growth Norway Spruce forests as a safe refuge against avian predators, while secondary stands of non-native Blue Spruce are suitable for hunting both main prey types (Apodemus mice and Microtus voles), and also ensure good protection against nest predation by Pine Martens.

AB  - Some of the last remaining near-natural boreal forest landscapes in northern Europe can be found in the Russian Karelia near its border with Finland. Currently, these forests are facing strong exploitation pressure in the form of extensive clearcuts. Demand for conservation is also high. We characterize the boreal forest landscape in the region and assess the impacts of past and potential management actions through a mapping and modeling study that synthesizes methods from landscape ecology, remote sensing, and simulation modeling. The forests of the study area were mapped using techniques for interpreting multitemporal satellite images and detecting changes. The species composition and structure of the forests were estimated using the multisource k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) method. Forest harvesting rates and current landscape patterns were used to parameterize models built with a cell-based Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator (SELES) modeling tool, and alternative land-use policy strategies were simulated with and without natural fire. Based on 10 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario, we can predict dramatic changes in the forest landscape structure after 30-70 yr. The current, complexly structured, near-natural forest assemblage will rapidly be converted into its transpose: an expanse of young regeneration stands, with blocks of near-natural forest extant only as islands within mires and in the reserve areas. The prompt establishment of the proposed Kalevala National Park is regionally important for these reasons: (1) to increase the types of near-natural forest conserved, (2) to provide a second large biodiversity source adjacent to the heavily fragmented Finnish forests, and (3) to reduce the currently inflated rate of harvesting.

AB  - Tourism in protected areas boosts local economies while adversely affecting the environment, local communities, and tourists. To tackle the negative effects of increasing tourism demand while retaining economic benefits, sustainable tourism policies should be properly implemented. In this study, Geiranger Fjord in Norway, a protected area included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, was taken as a case study. Data from an in situ questionnaire to tourists in the area, following the contingent valuation method, were further analysed with an ordinary least square model, price elasticities, and a mixed logit model. This research contributes to the existing literature on empirical evidence of the factors influencing tourists' perceptions of the use of economic instruments, as management policies, price sensitivities and destination substitution to surrounding areas, accounting for differences among socioeconomic characteristics, particularly age, gender, and education; in addition to trip features, namely, travel party, length of stay, and intra-destination activities; and destination motivations.Management implications: Successful sustainable tourism policies, such as economic instruments, should consider the different perceptions of tourists in terms of the implementation of these policies to achieve a greater acceptance and commitment towards conservation. This research provides empirical evidence that young, highly educated tourists and those hiking had a higher willingness to pay for an entrance fee; while females, families with children and tourists overnighting more than one night had a greater probability to go to a different destination with higher entrance fees. These findings could be used within the development of an adaptative and cooperative framework for sustainable tourism policies.

AB  - The aquaculture industry in Norway produced 1 3 million metric tons of fish in 2014, and further expansion is expected if the main sustainability challenges related to production and operation are mitigated. Major biological, operational and environmental challenges are parasite infection, fish escape, fish health, human injuries and fatalities. The larger farms, exposed locations, and sustainability challenges related to more production of salmon increases the need for efficient decision support methods and risk management. The combined effect of the technological development, with increased remote operation, autonomy and automation, and the production and operational challenges related to sustainability means that an interdisciplinary and systemic approach integrating risks to the environment, as well as to fish welfare and human safety, is needed. Therefore, the main contents of such a risk management approach are outlined in this paper. Potential users are fish farming companies, but the paper also addresses the need for an industry standard for sustainability and risk performance monitoring, which should be of interest to authorities and the whole industry. The paper concludes that risk management and sustainable development are complementary concepts that benefit each other because efficient risk management is decisive for achieving sustainability in aquaculture.

AB  - We studied the effects of different wood harvesting and utilisation policies on the carbon balance and economic profitability of forestry under the current and changing climate (A1B climate scenario). Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The choice of a rotation length is an integral part of even-aged forest management regimes. In this study, we simulated stand development and carbon pools in four even-aged stands representing the two most common tree species in Fennoscandia, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), growing on high-and low-productivity sites. We hypothesized that increased rotation lengths (+ 10, + 20, and + 30 years) in comparison with today's practice would increase forests' average carbon stock during a rotation cycle but decrease the average yield. The results showed that for spruce, a moderate increase in rotation length (+ 10 years) increased both average standing carbon stock and average yield. For the longer alternatives (+ 20 and + 30 years) for spruce and for all pine alternatives, prolonging rotation lengths resulted in increased average standing carbon stocks but decreased average yield, resulting in decreased carbon storage in forest products and decreased substitution effects. Decreasing the rotation lengths (-10 years) always resulted in both decreased average standing carbon stocks and decreased yields. We conclude that a moderate increase of rotation lengths may slightly increase forests' climate benefits for spruce sites, but for all other alternatives, there was a trade-off between the temporary gain of increasing carbon stocks and the permanent loss in productivity and, consequently, substitution potential.

AB  - The diversity in different groups of obligate saproxylic beetles was related to ecological variables at three levels of spatial scale in mature spruce-dominated forest. The variables were connected to: (i) decaying wood, (ii) wood-inhabiting fungi, (iii) the level of disturbance, (iv) landscape ecology, and (v) vegetational structure. Several strong relationships were found at medium (1 km(2)) and large scales (4 km(2)), while only weak relationships were found at a small scale (0.16 ha; 1 ha = 10(4) m(2)). This may be explained by the local variations in habitat parameters and the high mobilities of many beetle species. Factors connected to decaying wood and wood-inhabiting fungi were clearly the most important factors at all scale levels. In particular, the variables diversity of dead tree parts, number of dead trees of large diameter and number of polypore fungi species increased the species richness of many groups and increased the abundance of many species. Eight species were absent below a certain density of decaying wood per 1 or 4 km(2). Former extensive cutting was a negative factor at large scale, probably because of decreasing recolonization with increasing distance to the source habitats. Thinning reduced the diversity of species associated with birch. The development of guidelines favouring the diversity of saproxylic beetles are discussed below.

AB  - The ballan wrasse, Labrus bergylta, is a protogynous hermaphrodite marine fish species that inhabits coastal waters of the eastern North Atlantic. Sequential hermaphrodite species tend to be characterized by a skewed sex ratio, which is thought to lead to marked population structuring due to a reduced effective number of breeders. Furthermore, due to its large body size (compared with other wrasse species) and its peculiar feeding behaviour, this species has been identified as a candidate cleaner fish to be used in parasite control of farmed finfish. In the present study, we used mitochondrial DNA (control region) sequence data to investigate the genetic diversity and population structuring of ballan wrasse in waters around the British Isles and southern Norway. Ballan wrasse in southern Norway showed lower levels of genetic diversity than around the British Isles, which appear to be the result of historical demographic events (population bottleneck followed by expansion). Analysis of mismatch distributions and the presence of two highly divergent clades unevenly represented in Atlantic and Scandinavian regions suggest distinct recolonization patterns in these two regions. These results provide a first insight on the status of wild populations of ballan wrasse in the eastern North Atlantic, with implications for conservation and management.

AB  - Seafood is seen as promising for more sustainable diets. The increasing production in land-based closed Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RASs) has overcome many local environmental challenges with traditional open net-pen systems such as eutrophication. The energy needed to maintain suitable water quality, with associated emissions, has however been seen as challenging from a global perspective. This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to investigate the environmental performance and improvement potentials of a commercial RAS farm of tilapia and Clarias in Sweden. The environmental impact categories and indicators considered were freshwater eutrophication, climate change, energy demand, land use, and dependency on animal-source feed inputs per kg of fillet. We found that feed production contributed most to all environmental impacts (between 67 and 98%) except for energy demand for tilapia, contradicting previous findings that farm-level energy use is a driver of environmental pressures. The main improvement potentials include improved by-product utilization and use of a larger proportion of plant-based feed ingredients. Together with further smaller improvement potential identified, this suggests that RASs may play a more important role in a future, environmentally sustainable food system.

AB  - Half of the Finnish peatland area is drained for forestry. The remaining undrained peatlands are not all pristine, because surrounding drainage may disturb their hydrology. This concerns especially aapa mires, which are dependent on hydrological connections to their upper catchments. We investigated the amount and sizes of Finnish undrained peatlands, the drainage state of their margins, and the naturalness of aapa mires in large (> 50 ha) undrained peatland areas, using a GIS analysis based on digital map data, aerial images and an elevation model. The results show that a majority (66.7 % of count, 84.7 % of area) of undrained peatland areas have at least partly drained margins. Drainage activities commonly disturb minerotrophic water discharge to aapa mires. In the middle boreal zone, on average 41.6 % (median 42.8 %) of the catchment area of aapa mires is such that hydrological connection with the mire is disturbed by intervening drainage. In the southern boreal zone, the figure is 25.1 % (median 16.1 %), and in the southern part of the northern boreal zone 24.2 % (median 9.9 %). Possible implications of the disturbances include tree encroachment, hummock formation and fen-bog transition, which is likely to cause a loss of biodiversity but could potentially increase peat growth and carbon sequestration.

AB  - This article discusses effects of and drivers behind the current integration of experience-based knowledge in management. The case in point is production and integration of fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) in coastal zone management in Norway. The article discusses how the principles of social justice and protection of biodiversity drive FEK integration, through analysing a case of conflict between small-scale fishers and cod farming in Storfjord, northern Norway. The case became known for the appearance of deformed "monster cod'' which supported the fishers' claims that fish farming was harmful to the environment and thus also to the indigenous Sami culture. Assessing how FEK was judged in terms of its credibility, legitimacy and saliency, the article argues that the criteria by which FEK is judged are different from how other types of policy-relevant knowledge is judged. In addition to being scientifically credible, its quality as age-old knowledge derived from interaction with the environment increases its influence on management decisions in biodiversity conservation controversies where fishers' and managers' interests coincide. The article concludes that integration of FEK in management both fulfils goals of protection of biodiversity and social justice, which makes it harder to ignore in socially and environmentally controversial contexts in the future.

AB  - Natural spruce forests are restricted to the highest mountain ranges in the Czech Republic. Spruce is also the commonest tree species in managed forests. Owing to a massive decline of spruce forests in Central Europe, caused by recent climatic fluctuations and disturbances, the lichen diversity and species composition was compared between ten representative natural mountain old-growth forests in the Czech Republic and their counterparts in mature managed forests. The old-growth forests are characterized by a higher species richness, abundance, number of Red-listed species, functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities. Plots with the highest species richness are situated in the Sumava Mountains, an area with a relatively low sulphur deposition in the past. Bioindication analysis searching for lichen indicators supported several species (e.g. Xylographa vitiligo, Chaenotheca sphaerocephala) and genera (e.g. Calicium, Xylographa) with a strong preference for old-growth forests. Analysis of lichen functional traits revealed a higher abundance of species with a vegetative reproduction in managed forests that may be explained by a higher efficiency in colonization by young successional stages. Lichens with stalked apothecia, pigmented ascospores and large ascospores are more frequent in old-growth forests. Our results are briefly discussed in terms of nature conservation, focusing on national refugees of old-growth forest species, biodiversity hot-spots, practical use of indicator species and representative measures for an evaluation of forest quality.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban green space provides multiple recreation opportunities with important benefits for physical and psychological well-being, but access to these benefits is often unequally distributed. Various methodologies to assess outdoor recreation opportunities exist, but they rarely take into consideration dimensions of environmental justice. The aim of this paper is to map and assess nature-based outdoor recreation opportunities with a focus on green space accessibility for different social groups, and discuss the results in light of of environmental justice. We use the Oslo metropolitan area, Norway, as a case study. We combine statistical analysis with spatial modelling to assess recreation preferences and distribution of nature-based recreation opportunities. We also analyse accessibility for different social groups, including children and the elderly, migrants and low-income households. Our results show that most people prefer large wooded green areas, high density of trees, and presence of water, although preferences differ depending on age and place of residence. Areas for daily recreation are accessible to the whole population in the study area, but they are unequally distributed, migrants and low-income households having relatively less access. Our methodology can also be applied in other cities and metropolitan areas to assess differences in accessibility to outdoor recreation opportunities. We discuss whether and to which extent these results illustrate a situation of environmental injustice. We conclude that the relation between access to green space and environmental justice can be complex, and that injustice may not automatically result from uneven access.

AB  - A growing awareness of the negative consequences of efficient fire prevention in boreal Fennoscandia has resulted in an increasing use of fire as a restoration method. The primary purpose of restoration fire is to recreate features of natural forests that have been lost during long periods of fire suppression. We used the occurrence of fruiting bodies from wood-inhabiting fungi to assess the conservation value of and gain ecological information about restoration fire in a Pinus sylvestris dominated forest. The general pattern for the majority of the species was a drastic decline the first two years after the restoration fire. However, our results clearly demonstrate that most of the species that declined the first years after the fire rebounded after four years and were frequently found on charred wood. Species that increased after the fire and often occurred on charred logs were: Antrodia sinuosa, Botryobasidium obtusisporum, Galzinia incrustans, Phlebia subserialis and Tomentella spp. In addition, three threatened, red-listed and fire-favored species were also found on heavily charred logs: Antrodia primaeva, Dichomitus squalens and Gloeophyllum carbonarium. Our results indicate that fire disturbance creates a unique type of dead wood important for fungal species richness. The results also support the use of restoration fires in maintaining forest biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As in many other building types, space efficiency in mid-rise timber apartment buildings is one of the critical design parameters to make a project feasible. Space efficiency depends on varying selection criteria related to construction materials, construction methods, and proper planning. To date, no study provides a comprehensive understanding of space efficiency in mid-rise timber apartment buildings. This paper examined data from 55 Finnish mid-rise timber apartment buildings built between 2018 and 2022 under the Finnish Land Use and Building Act to increase the understanding of which factors and design parameters influence the space efficiency of mid-rise timber apartment buildings. The main findings of this study indicated that: (1) among the case studies, the space efficiency ranged from 77.8% to 87.9%, and the average was 83%; (2) the mean values of the ratios of structural wall area to gross floor area, vertical circulation area to gross floor area, and technical spaces (including shafts) to gross floor area were found to be 12.9%, 2.6%, and 1.5%, respectively; (3) construction methods or shear wall materials make no significant difference in terms of space efficiency, and there is no scientific correlation between the number of stories and space efficiency; (4) the best average space efficiency was achieved with central core type, followed by peripheral core arrangement. This research will contribute to design guidelines for clients, developers, architects, and other construction professionals of mid-rise timber apartment building projects.

AB  - This study evaluated yield statistics and data from a comprehensive national soil inventory representing 90 yield survey districts and from the Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments. The aim was to identify the most yield limiting soil properties and best agronomic practices in order to further improve yield. Principal Component Analysis, multi-variate analysis, step-wise regression, and tree partitioning analysis identified the same variables affecting yields in the national and experimental datasets. Crop yields were significantly affected by soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), plant-available soil phosphorus (P-AL) and mean annual temperature. Contents of plant available potassium and magnesium in soil had no significant impact on yield, except in potatoes. Soil pH was found to have the greatest potential to affect crop yields, even at values >6.5 (pH((H2O))). Soil organic matter ranging from 3 to 6% in Swedish arable soils had an indirect negative effect on crop yields by lowering soil pH values with higher SOM content. To fully exploit the known benefits of SOM, liming requires more attention. One important finding was that current Swedish agricultural recommendations require updating. High-yielding crops demand more plant-available soil P and a range of 60-100 mg P-AL kg-1 soil is needed for sufficient P supply. A new target value of pH 7 for all crops except potatoes is recommended.

AB  - Assessing cumulative effects are a vital task for strategic environmental assessments (SEA) but lack of consistent methodology has hampered the development and implementation of useful tools. We present a model for GIS and multivariate analysis to assess the effects on a valued ecosystem type at a regional scale based on the sum of impacts of local projects. We demonstrate application of the model by assessing how hydropower developments would generate cumulative impacts on river gorges for a county in northern Norway. We use principal component analyses (PCA) of spatially-explicit variables from the region to describe the diversity of river gorge ecology with a mathematical low-dimensional bioclimatic space. We then calculate cumulative effects of hydropower development as the proportions of subspaces of the multidimensional bioclimatic PCA that are affected by either existing infrastructure or planned and possible hydropower developments. The results showed that adding development of all potential sites for small-scale hydropower would have substantial impacts on over half of all bioclimatic segments where gorges were registered and more than 70% of all segments with forested river gorges. By demonstrating these possible cumulative effects we can illustrate the need for caution in hydropower planning to avoid reducing river gorge representativeness and diversity. The method can be applied for other types of development projects and other valued ecosystems, provided the assessed ecosystems and development installations can be mapped or modelled over a sufficiently large area.

AB  - Autonomous photographic landers are a low-impact survey method for the assessment of mobile fauna in situations where methods such as trawling are not feasible or ethical. Three institutions collaborated through the CoralFISH project, each using differing lander systems, to assess the effects of cold-water corals on fish diversity and density. The Biogenic Reef Ichthyofauna Lander (BRIL, Oceanlab), Autonomous Lander for Biological Experiments (ALBEX, NIOZ) and the Marine Environment MOnitoring system (MEMO, CoNISMa) were deployed in four CoralFISH European study regions covering the Arctic, NE Atlantic and Mediterranean, namely Northern Norway (275-310 m depth), Belgica Mound Province (686-1025 m depth), the Bay of Biscay (623-936 m depth), and Santa Maria di Leuca (547-670 m depth). A total of 33 deployments were carried out in the different regions. Both the time of first arrival (T-arr) and the maximum observed number of fish (MaxN) were standardised between the different lander systems and compared between coral and reference stations as indicators of local fish density. Fish reached significantly higher MaxN at the coral stations than at the reference stations. Fish were also found to have significantly lower T-arr, in the coral areas in data obtained from the BRIL and MEMO landers. All data indicated that fish abundance is higher within the coral areas. Fish species diversity was higher within the coral areas of Atlantic Ocean while in Northern Norway and Santa Maria di Leuca coral areas, diversity was similar at coral and reference stations but a single dominant species (Brosme brosme and Conger conger respectively) showed much higher density within the coral areas. Indicating that, while cold-water coral reefs have a positive effect on fish diversity and/or abundance, this effect varies across Europe's reefs.

AB  - Climate change is a global concern. Within Nordic countries such as Finland it has particular influence on the use of natural resources. Family forest owners own 61% of the forested land in Finland and 80% of the industrial roundwood purchased comes from these forest owners. Thus how private forest owners approach climate change is of high national economic and ecological importance. In order to understand family forest owners' perspectives on climate change in their own forests, qualitative interviews along walks through the owner's forests were conducted. Analysis of the conversations during these walks highlighted that forest owners discussed the phenomenon without prompting more often than hypothesized. Additionally, forest owners were less certain as to the causes of changes observed in their forests, mostly willing to take advice from professionals, and economically-driven in their response. For those forest owners who did express concern regarding climate change, they were at a loss for ways their efforts could make a meaningful difference. The prevalent uncertainty among forest owners calls for guidance from authority. Policy practices should make an effort to combine monetary incentives along with climate change focused forest management practices. Additionally, forest owner's reliance on the advice and expertise of forestry professionals should be utilized when pursuing climate-motivated forest management.

AB  - To better understand the historic range of variability in the fire regime of Fennoscandian boreal forests we cross-dated 736 fire scars of remnant Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood samples in a 3.6 km(2) section of the Trillemarka-Rollagsfjell Reserve of south-central Norway. Using a kernel range application in GIS we spatially delineated 57 individual forest fires between 1350 and the present. We found a strong anthropogenic signal in the fire regime from 1600 and onwards: (i) infrequent variably sized fires prior to 1600 shifted to frequent fires gradually decreasing in size during the 1600s and 1700s, with only a few small fires after 1800; (ii) time intervals between fires and the hazard of burning showed substantial differences pre- and post-1600; (iii) fire seasonality changed from late-to early-season fires from the 1626 fire and onwards; and (iv) fire severity decreased gradually over time. Written sources corroborated our results, narrating a history where anthropogenic forest fires and slash-and-burn cultivation expanded with the increasing population from the late 1500s. Concurrently, timber resources increased in value, gradually forcing slash-and-burn cultivators to abandon fires on forest land. Our results strengthen and expand previous Fennoscandian findings on the anthropogenic influence of historic fire regimes.

AB  - Evolution takes time. It is generally believed that for a given species older populations have diversified more than younger ones. To test this hypothesis, two regions in southern Sweden of different age, determined based on land uplift data, were chosen for studying morphological differentiation within the orchid species Dactylorhiza traunsteineri. Individuals from 10 populations in an older region, Gotland, and 11 populations in a younger region, Uppland, were scored for 54 morphological characters. Patterns of morphological variation and the structure of diversity were analyzed using multivariate and simple statistics; the degrees of correspondence among matrices of morphological and environmental factors were calculated. Morphological variation among populations was greater in the older region. This pattern was consistent in all analyses, although more pronounced in the analyses of floral morphology than in analyses of vegetative morphology. Orchid populations on Gotland appear to be relatively old, small and isolated, but genetic drift does not seem to have been important for the differentiation among populations. Other factors, such as habitat heterogeneity, pollinator-mediated selection and accumulation of neutral mutations, were more important. Although populations from Uppland are young, the founder effect does not seem to have been responsible for the low level of diversity among populations. Differentiation appeared to have been limited by low habitat diversity, and a lack of time for genetic drift and for the accumulation of mutations. This study shows that patterns of differentiation within this species are indeed time-dependent.

AB  - This study offers new insights into the largest threats to natural and mixed World Heritage sites in developed countries as considered by their management. In addition to this, the capacity of the management to deal with threats is examined. An Ordered Probit model is used that distinguishes three groups of threats and four categories of adaptive capacity of the management. Data originate from the 2014 UNESCO Periodic Report II for sites in economically advanced countries (Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea) linked to the World Heritage Site database. Estimation results reveal that the probability of a major threat to World Heritage sites is perceived to be highest in the category of climate change and extreme weather events, followed by local conditions affecting the physical structure (temperature, rain, dust). Sites in tropical climates are perceived as significantly more threatened, as are those earlier listed as in danger. The likelihood of perceiving a major threat is highest in Turkey, Italy, Norway and North America. Threats related to climate change are those the management has the lowest capacity to deal with when other important aspects are controlled for. Large and natural areas have a higher perceived administrative capacity to deal with threats than others.

AB  - Ungulates frequently cause damage to human livelihoods, such as agriculture, livestock or forestry. In Sweden, forestry is the dominating land use and is a very important source of income. Moose (Alces alces) browsing commonly causes damage to young forest stands, mainly Scots pine (Punts sylvestris). Factors known to affect the level of moose browsing damage are moose density, forage availability, site productivity, tree species composition, snow depth, and infrastructure. One hypothesis is that the recent recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden may lead to a decrease in browsing damage levels, through an effect of wolf predation on moose density or moose behaviour. We used data from annual moose browsing damage surveys, long-term wolf monitoring, moose harvest statistics, habitat composition, snow depth, and road network to investigate the effect of wolf recolonization on moose browsing damage on Scots pine. Contrary to predicted, wolf territory establishment and duration showed an increase in the level of moose damage on young Scots pine. But, the effect size was small and it is questionable if it can be considered as biologically relevant. Overall, other factors were more important than wolves in explaining browsing damage on pine by moose. Presence and cover of deciduous species increased the occurrence of moose browsing damage on pine but reduced the level of damage. Decreasing snow depth and increasing road density both resulted in a lower level of damage. We suggest that the strong human impact on all trophic levels on the Swedish forest ecosystem through harvest and intense forestry practices is likely to override wolves' effects on density and behaviour of moose, as well as their potential effects on preferred browsing species for moose.

AB  - Fine roots and above-ground litterfall play a pivotal role in carbon dynamics in forests. Nonetheless, direct estimation of stocks of fine roots remains methodologically challenging. Models are thus widely used to estimate these stocks and help elucidate drivers of fine root growth and turnover, at a range of scales. We updated a database of fine root biomass, necromass and production derived from 454 plots across European forests. We then compared fine root biomass and production to estimates obtained from 19 different models. Typical input variables used for the models included climate, net primary production, foliage and above-ground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), latitude and/or land cover type. We tested whether performance could be improved by fitting new multiple regression models, and explored effects of species composition and sampling method on estimated fine root biomass. Average fine root biomass was 332 g/m(2), and necromass 379 g/m(2), for European forests where the average fine root production was 250 g m(-2) year(-1). Carbon fraction in fine roots averaged 48.4%, and was 1.5% greater in broadleaved species than conifers. Available models were poor predictors of fine root biomass and production. The best performing models assumed proportionality between above- and below-ground compartments, and used remotely sensed LAI or foliage biomass as key inputs. Model performance was improved by use of multiple regressions, which revealed consistently greater biomass and production in stands dominated by broadleaved species as well as in mixed stands even after accounting for climatic differences. Synthesis. We assessed the potential of existing models to estimate fine root biomass and production in European forests. We show that recalibration reduces by about 40% errors in estimates currently produced by the best available models, and increases three-fold explained variation. Our results underline the quantitative significance of fine roots (live and dead) to the global carbon cycle.

AB  - Forest harvest has multiple impacts on adjoining freshwater ecosystems, particularly headwater streams which typically receive minimal protection against forestry. However, evidence on the effectiveness of differently sized riparian buffers remains limited. Using data from two discrete regions of Finland, we assessed the effectiveness of riparian buffers in providing protection for the riparian and stream environment, benthic invertebrate diversity and species composition, and ecosystem functioning of boreal headwater streams. Our study included streams with both wide (> 15 m) and narrow (< 15 m) riparian buffers, enabling comparison of the two dominant forest certificates (FSC and PEFC). Compared to unharvested reference streams, nutrient concentrations as well as stream and riparian light intensity and temperature were higher at forestry-impacted sites. The amount of woody debris, cover of aquatic mosses and particulate organic matter standing stock were strongly reduced in streams draining harvested forests, especially in narrowly buffered streams. Changes in light and nutrient conditions induced a transition towards more autotrophic conditions. Organic matter decomposition rates were elevated in forestry-impacted sites only in the southern region. Forest harvest decreased macroinvertebrate diversity and evenness, and altered community composition in the northern region, but much weaker changes were observed in the southern region. Our findings support the retention of riparian buffers, but also confirm that their effectiveness depends on the environmental context and thus remains poorly predictable. Our results also suggest that the widely applied PEFC certification does not provide sufficient protection for stream ecosystems and more stringent protocols are needed to ensure ecological sustainability of forestry.

AB  - The threat posed by biological invasions is well established. An important consideration in preventing the spread of invasives and also subsequent introductions lies in understanding introduction pathways. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) houses a large percentage of the world's biodiversity, yet no national strategy exists to deal with the growing number of invasive alien species. Amongst these are the house mouse and ship and Norwegian rats. By comparing our result to published data, we show that species were possibly introduced into the DRC via two routes. The first is via the western seaport at Kinshasa where specimens of M. m. domesticus and R. rattus on the western and northwestern side of the DRC show ties with European haplotypes. The second is via the east where specimens of R. rattus appear linked to Arab and southeast Asian haplotypes. Future work should consider more comprehensive sampling throughout the DRC to more accurately investigate the occurrence of invasive species throughout the country as well as extend sampling to other African countries.

AB  - Climate warming is likely to shift the range margins of species poleward, but fine-scale temperature differences near the ground (microclimates) may modify these range shifts. For example, cold-adapted species may survive in microrefugia when the climate gets warmer. However, it is still largely unknown to what extent cold microclimates govern the local persistence of populations at their warm range margin. We located 99 microrefugia, defined as sites with edge populations of 12 widespread boreal forest understory species (vascular plants, mosses, liverworts and lichens) in an area of ca. 24,000 km(2) along the species' southern range margin in central Sweden. Within each population, a logger measured temperature eight times per day during one full year. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we examined the differences of the populations' microclimates with the mean and range of microclimates in the landscape, and identified the typical climate, vegetation and topographic features of these habitats. Comparison sites were drawn from another logger data set (n = 110), and from high-resolution microclimate maps. The microrefugia were mainly places characterized by lower summer and autumn maximum temperatures, late snow melt dates and high climate stability. Microrefugia also had higher forest basal area and lower solar radiation in spring and autumn than the landscape average. Although there were common trends across northern species in how microrefugia differed from the landscape average, there were also interspecific differences and some species contributed more than others to the overall results. Our findings provide biologically meaningful criteria to locate and spatially predict potential climate microrefugia in the boreal forest. This opens up the opportunity to protect valuable sites, and adapt forest management, for example, by keeping old-growth forests at topographically shaded sites. These measures may help to mitigate the loss of genetic and species diversity caused by rear-edge contractions in a warmer climate.

AB  - More than 12000 ha of a Norway spruce forest in Tatra National Park, Slovakia, were laid down by a strong windstorm on 19 November 2004. Most of the broken and uprooted trees were completely removed from the area in the following months, but the remaining fallen trees were left in their natural successional state. We analysed the impact of these two strategies of forest management on the structure of the soil-nematode community and its relationships with the structure of the plant community and with basic soil physicochemical properties nine years after the windstorm. The relationships were investigated in a cleared windstorm plot (EXT), a non-extracted windstorm plot (NEX), and an undamaged forest plot (REF) as a control. All plots were sampled twice, in June and October 2013. Results showed that EXT and NEX had a significantly higher mean nematode abundance at both sampling dates than REF (LSD, P = 0.05). REF had the mean number of species, similar to the mean number in NEX. Analysis of variance showed significant main interaction among sampling time (P = 0.01), plots (P = 0.05) and number of species. Spearman's correlations identified positive correlations between the number of species and soil carbon and nitrogen contents (P <= 0.05) and between the number of fungivores and soil nitrogen content (P <= 0.05). A detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the abundance of plant parasitic nematodes was positively affected by the dominance of the grasses Avenella flexuosa in EXT and Calamagrostis villosa in NEX. Predators and root-fungal feeders were significantly less abundant in EXT and NEX (P = 0.05), and omnivores were most abundant in EXT and NEX. Analyses of the nematode communities by ecological and functional indices, except the plant-parasitic and enrichment indices, indicated that nematode abundance and species numbers did not differ between management strategies. The soil environments of all habitats could be characterised as mature, structured, nitrogen-rich, or nutrient-balanced with high or narrow carbon/nitrogen ratios, confirmed by an analysis of metabolic footprints. In summary, the impact of the windstorm on the soil-nematode community was still visible nine years later. The structure of the nematode community, however, had rehabilitated, likely due more to changes in the secondary herbaceous layer associated with the two management strategies than to the soil properties, which were not affected by the windstorm or management in the long term.

AB  - Since the 1990s, the marine benthos of the Greenland-Iceland-Faeroe (GIF) Ridge has been sampled through the BIOICE (Benthic Invertebrates of Icelandic waters) and subsequent IceAGE (Icelandic Marine Animals: Genetics and Ecology) projects. Isopod crustaceans formed one of the prominent macrofaunal groups. Most isopod families occurred on both sides of the ridge, but showed side-specific abundance patterns reflecting known distribution from the literature. Our results from 35,536 isopod specimens from 55 epibenthic sled stations show a depth pattern at the family level indicating typical shallow water families like, for example, Paramunnidae or typical deep-water families like, for example, Haploniscidae and Ischnomesidae, while other families did not show a clear depth trend. We hypothesize that the ridge influences the distribution of the families through its effects on the hydrography and sediment characteristics. Total organic carbon (TOC) and mud content significantly explained isopod family distributions, possibly reflecting different habitat use and lifestyle (e.g., infaunal, epifaunal). Our analysis of a subset of 27 selected BIOICE and IceAGE stations and 100 isopod species (22,574 specimens), mostly covering the upper 1000 m depths between Iceland and Norway along the Iceland-Faeroe Ridge (IFR), resulted in four main species assemblages differing in species diversity. Whereas north of the IFR, we found 76 species; south of the IFR, we found 52 species; 40 species occurred both north and south of the IFR. Although the subset of selected stations is limited to a comparably small portion of the IceAGE sampling grid and to a comparably restricted depth range of the upper 1000 m, our result shows the slope area of Northeast Iceland and around the Faeroes and the Norwegian Channel with the highest number of species, especially stations in the thermocline between 400 and 800 m depth, where we observed the turnover from shallow to deep-water faunal elements.

AB  - Background
   Fungus gnats (Sciaroidea) are a globally species rich group of lower Diptera. In Europe, Fennoscandian peninsula in particular holds a notable diversity, ca. 1000 species, of which 10 % are still unnamed. Fungus gnats are predominantly terrestrial insects, but some species dwell in wetland habitats.
   New information
   Eight new fungus gnat species, belonging to the families Keroplatidae (Orfelia boreoalpina Salmela sp.n.) and Mycetophilidae (Sciophila holopaineni Salmela sp.n., S. curvata Salmela sp.n., Boletina sasakawai Salmela & Kolcsar sp.n., B. norokorpii Salmela & Kolcsar sp.n., Phronia sompio Salmela sp.n., P. reducta Salmela sp.n., P prolongata Salmela sp.n.), are described. Four of the species are known from Fennoscandia only whilst two are supposed to have boreo-alpine disjunct ranges, i.e. having populations in Fennoscandia and the Central European Alps. One of the species probably has a boreal range (Finnish Lapland and Central Siberia). Type material of Boletina curta Sasakawa & Kimura from Japan was found to consist of two species, and a further species close to these taxa is described from Finland. Phronia elegantula Hackman is redescribed and reported for the first time from Norway. DNA barcodes are provided for the first time for five species.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are the major cause of native species extinctions on islands worldwide. To mitigate or eliminate IAS impacts, eradication is often the best alternative. However, IAS removal may result in cascading effects, through increase in prey abundance, mesopredator release, or competitor release. Our objective is to determine which ecological processes may influence the relative abundance of invasive carnivores and rodents on an insular system. We find that feral cat and mustelids relative abundance was strongly related by prey abundance, and for the feral cat, abundance was also controlled by habitat; these results suggest that bottom-up control through environmental filtering could be the mechanism explaining predator abundance. For rodents, we find that the abundance of the black rat was mostly controlled by the abundance of Norway rat and house mice, and food availability; the Norway rat by the abundance of black rat, a house mice and of mustelid predators; and house mouse by the other rodents and food availability. These results suggest that several mechanisms could be concurrently controlling abundance of these species; competition and predation for Norway rat, and competition and bottom-up control by environmental filtering for the other two rodents. While different factors explain the abundance of invasive species within the same functional group, food resource availability is, in general, the main controller of abundance of invasive rodents and carnivores in the Azores. Therefore, IAS management actions in these islands should focus on limiting the access to food resources and shelter, mainly near to human populations.

AB  - Marine ecosystems world-wide are threatened by oxygen deficiency, with potential serious consequences for ecosystem functioning and the goods and services they provide. While the effects of hypoxia on benthic species diversity are well documented, the effects on ecosystem function have only rarely been assessed in real-world settings. To better understand the links between structural changes in macro- and meiofaunal communities, hypoxic stress and benthic ecosystem function (benthic nutrient fluxes, community metabolism), we sampled a total of 11 sites in Haystensfjord and Askerofjord (Swedish west coast) in late summer, coinciding with the largest extent and severity of seasonal hypoxia in the area. The sites spanned oxic to anoxic bottom water, and a corresponding gradient in faunal diversity. Intact sediment cores were incubated to measure fluxes of oxygen and nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO43-, SiO4) across the sediment-water interface. Sediment profile imaging (SPI) footage was obtained from all sites to assess structural elements and the bioturbadon depth, and additional samples were collected to characterise sediment properties and macro- and meiofaunal community composition. Bottom-water O-2 concentration was the main driver of macrofauna communities, with highest abundance and biomass, as well as variability, at the sites with intermediate O-2 concentration. Meiofauna on the other hand was less sensitive to bottom-water O-2 concentration. Oxygen was the main driver of nutrient fluxes too, but macrofauna as well meiofauna were also significant predictors; DistLM analyses indicated that O-2 concentration, macrofaunal abundance or biomass, and meiofaunal abundance collectively explained 63%, 30% and 28% of the variation in sediment O-2 consumption, NH4+ flux and PO43+ flux, respectively. The study provides a step towards a more realistic understanding of the link between benthic fauna and ecosystem functioning, and the influence of disturbance on this relationship, which is important for management decisions aimed at protecting the dwindling biodiversity in the coastal zones around the world.

AB  - For several decades, computerized forest decision support systems (DSS) have helped managers and decision makers to analyze different management options and supported the search for preferred management alternatives. In Sweden, a country rich in forests and with a long tradition in intensive forest management, such systems have been developed and available since the 1970s. Changes in societal as well as in forest owners' preferences and objectives in the 1990s led to a need for forest DSS handling broader perspectives compared to precedent single-objective timber-oriented systems. In Sweden, this led to the initiation of a research programme in the beginning of the 2000s aiming at developing a versatile and multi-objective forest DSS, resulting in the first version of the Heureka forest DSS released in 2009. The system handles several forest values, such as timber and biofuel production, carbon sequestration, dead wood dynamics, habitat for species, recreation and susceptibility to forest damages (spruce bark beetle, wind-throw and root rot). It contains a suite of software for different problem settings and geographical scales and uses simulation as well as optimization techniques. Three software handle projections of the forest using a common core of growth and yield models for simulating forest dynamics. A fourth software, built for multi-criteria decision analysis and including a web-version, enables also group decision making and participatory planning. For more than 10 years, the Heureka system has been used in teaching, environmental analysis, research and as decision support in practical forestry. For example, several research groups using the system for analyses in different problem areas have so far published more than 80 scientific papers. The system is used for nation-wide forest impact analysis for policy support and all large and many medium-sized forest owners use it for their long-term forest planning, meaning that it directly influences forest management decisions and activities on more than 50% of the Swedish forest area. Besides presenting the present system and its use, we also discuss lessons learned and potential future development.

AB  - The importance of aquaculture in the fishery sector is increasing. The growth of aquaculture complements the stagnant growth of extractive fisheries. Many countries are now entering this emerging economic activity. This positive feature has some serious drawbacks when the country has no local institutions to ensure the environmental sustainability of aquaculture. The Chilean salmon farming industry has grown dramatically since the mid-1980s to become the leading exporter of farmed salmon after Norway. The sector, however, suffered decline due to the sanitary crisis in 2007. It is said that this crisis was caused by overexploitation and overconcentration of fish farms. This paper tries to explain the mechanisms of the sanitary crisis - a tragedy of the commons' - by paying attention to the role of endogenous factors such as local knowledge, capacity building, local ecological conditions and the emergence of local institutions, focusing on the case of salmon farming in Chile.

AB  - Through the construction of a socio-ecological timeline for the Porsanger fjord ecosystem, this article illustrates the different ways in which environmental and social-ecological changes have influenced the adaptations of rural households in coastal Sami communities in Finnmark, north Norway. The main finding is that, although environmental change in the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the social-ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and ecological restoration of kelp beds. Flexible diversification of livelihoods allows exploitation of a range of adjacent species without large investments in a fossile fuel-driven fisheries economy. Investing in regrowth of macroalgae to foster cod nursery areas and increase carbon sequestration can be a relevant alternative for communities that are interested in contributing to climate change mitigation on a larger scale.

AB  - Heavy metal content of sewage sludge is currently the most significant factor limiting its reuse in agriculture within the European Union. In the Netherlands most of the produced sewage sludge is incinerated, mineralizing the organic carbon into the atmosphere rather than returning it back to the soil. Source-separation of black water (toilet water) excludes external heavy metal inputs, such as industrial effluents and surface run-offs, producing sludge with reduced heavy metal content that is a more favorable source for resource recovery. The results presented in this paper show that feces is the main contributor to the heavy metal loading of vacuum collected black water (52-84%), while in sewage the contribution of feces is less than 10%. To distinguish black water from sewage in the sludge reuse regulation, a control parameter should be implemented, such as the Hg and Pb content that is significantly higher in sewage sludge compared to black water sludge (from 50- to 200-fold). The heavy metals in feces and urine are primarily from dietary sources, and promotion of the soil application of black water sludge over livestock manure and artificial fertilizers could further reduce the heavy metal content in the soil/food cycle.

AB  - The biodiversity and phylogeny of Fusarium graminearum isolates originating from different geographical areas were analyzed using isozyme variation, beta-tubulin and IGS sequences. Geographically distinct groups of isolates originating from different areas of the Russian Federation, China, Germany and Finland were studied. The complex enzymes (alpha- and beta-esterases, aspartate aminotransferase and superoxide dismutase) and the IGS sequences demonstrated a high level of genetic diversity in F. graminearum. Diversity in the Asian population was higher than in the European one. There was a correlation between genetic clusters of the IGS sequences and geographical origin in F. graminearum. Knowledge of biodiversity and identification of some phylogenetic lineages in F. graminearum will be useful in de. ning the risk of pathogen evolution as well as benefiting disease management strategies.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens plant and pollinator communities, as well as their interactions. However, the effects of landscape fragmentation on the pollination of wild plant species are not well understood yet, partly because there are many correlated features in fragmented landscapes (e.g., decreased patch size, increased isolation, and patch complexity) whose influences are difficult to disentangle. Using a structural equation modeling approach, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of landscape fragmentation (patch size, isolation and complexity, percentage of surrounding land in forest) on the abundance, functional-group richness, and evenness of pollinators of 24 habitat fragments within an agricultural landscape in Southern Norway. In addition, we studied how these variables affected visitation rates (visits per flower) and seed production (seed set, seed mass) in the four most abundant plant species in the area. Flower abundance was higher in larger and complex patches and decreased with the percentage of forest in the surroundings, while flower richness increased with patch complexity. We found a direct negative relationship between patch complexity and the overall number of pollinator visits that the habitat fragments received. Apart from this direct landscape effect, pollinator visits were mostly affected by the floral communities, with overall flower abundance and richness increasing both total number of pollinator visits and pollinator-group richness, and flower richness having an additional negative influence on pollinator-group evenness. Interestingly, we did not find any direct link between visitation rates and reproductive success for any of the study plant species. Instead, several landscape variables directly affected species seed production, although the effects of landscape on seed production were highly species specific. Patch complexity had a negative effect on seed production in two of the four focal species, while other components of the landscape had species-specific effects. Increasing fragmentation of agricultural landscapes affects pollination interactions at the community level and the reproduction of wild plants. However, understanding the effects of fragmentation on seed production requires going beyond estimating visitation rates, since landscape effects on plant reproduction are not always related to overall interaction frequencies.

AB  - The Baltic Sea, formed after the latest glaciation, is an enclosed, low-saline, non-tidal ecosystem and has steep latitudinal and vertical gradients from sub-arctic conditions in the north to temperate in the south. The sea has undergone rapid changes since the glaciation, and the "ecological age" of the present ecosystem is only about 8000 years. Primary successional processes are still ongoing, and numerous ecological niches (e.g. large-bodied sediment bioturbators) remain available for immigration. The system is species-poor and vulnerable to the threat of exotic invasive species, and to date about 50 zoobenthic species have established populations in the Baltic Sea. The present biota is a mixture of species of different ecological and zoogeographical origin (marine to limnic; northern Arctic marine and limmic, to North Sea and Atlantic marine). The current distribution patterns of zoobenthos are illustrated, using marine, limnic and non-indigenous examples of structure and ecosystem functions. The species richness decreases from over 1600 marine benthic species in the open Skagerrak to about 500 in the western parts of the Baltic Sea, approximately 80 in the southern regions, to less than 20 in the northern regions. On the other hand, limnic species increase diversity in the inner reaches of the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. Polychaetes, molluscs and echinoderms are dramatically reduced in numbers from the south to the north. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Land set aside for preservation of biodiversity often has low productivity. As biodiversity generally increases with productivity, due to higher or more diverse availability of resources, this implies that some of the biodiversity may be left unprotected. Due to a lack of knowledge on the species diversity and conservation value of low-productivity habitats, the consequences of the biased allocation of low-productivity land for set-asides are unknown.
   2. We examined the conservation value of boreal low-productivity forests (potential tree growth <1 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) by comparing assemblages of tree- and deadwood-dwelling lichens and forest stand structure between productive and low-productivity forest stands. We surveyed 84 Scots pine-dominated stands in three regions in Sweden, each including four stand types: two productive (managed and unman-aged) and two low-productivity stands (on mires and on thin, rocky soils).
   3. Lichen species richness was the highest in low-productivity stands on thin soil, which had similar amounts and diversity of resources (living trees and dead wood) to productive unmanaged stands. Stands in low-productivity mires, which had low abundance of living trees and dead wood, hosted the lowest lichen richness. Lichen species composition differed among stand types, but none of them hosted unique species. The differences in both species richness and composition were more pronounced in northern than in southern Sweden, likely due to shorter history of intensive forestry.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Boreal low-productivity forests can have as high conservation value as productive forests, which should be reflected in conservation strategies. However, their value is far from uniform, and conservation planning should acknowledge this variation and not treat all low-productivity forests as a uniform group. Some types of low-productivity forest (e.g. on rocky soil) are more valuable than others (e.g. on mires), and should thus be prioritized in conservation. It is also important to consider the landscape context: low-productivity forests may have higher value in landscapes where high-productivity forests are highly influenced by forestry. Finally, although low-productivity forests can be valuable for some taxa, productive forests may still be important for other taxa.

AB  - Roseroot (Rhodiola rosea L.), an adaptogenic herb, has received increased attention in recent years. The genetic diversity of roseroot was studied with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, which have not been widely used so far. Plants were collected in Finnmark County, Norway, from 10 habitats. Eight recently developed microsatellite (SSR) markers were used to assess genetic diversity. However, only 4 SSR markers were informative during this study. The primer pairs for these 4 SSR markers produced 20 fragments with an average of 5 putative alleles per locus. Observed heterozygosity was 1.0 at each locus, whereas expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.60 to 0.65. The generated unrooted dendrogram based on genetic distances calculated from the results confirms that genetic diversity exists between the populations; the more distant they are from each other, the higher the genetic difference is.

AB  - Fucus vesiculosus (here Fucus) is a key species on rocky shores of the Baltic Sea, providing habitat for a diverse invertebrate community. While the invertebrate species within Fucus belts and their general distribution in the Baltic Sea are well known, much less is known about variation in invertebrate abundances and in community composition on different spatial scales. With requirements to monitor the status of marine habitats and com-munities, knowledge on species variation across environmental gradients is increasingly important. Knowledge on the abundances of different grazer species is also needed to evaluate the effects of fauna on Fucus on different spatial scales.In this study, a large-scale field campaign in seven geographically distinct areas along the Baltic Sea coast was conducted to assess variation in Fucus-associated invertebrate communities along eutrophication gradients (areas classified as either good, moderate or poor status). In addition, local scale exposure effects on invertebrate communities were studied. Eutrophication-related variation in invertebrate communities was found, with generally lower species abundances in the good status areas compared to areas in poor or moderate status. Especially in poor status areas, Fucus hosted high abundances of gammarids and chironomids. No specific taxa clearly functioned as an indicator for the eutrophication status and Pielou's evenness was similar across studied areas. However, lower Shannon diversity and number of taxa were found in areas where the status of Fucus is poor. Furthermore, abundances of some taxa, e.g. Idotea spp. isopods and Theodoxus fluviatilis snails were lower in areas where the non-indigenous crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii has been observed. On a local scale, exposed sides of small islands had less T. fluviatilis. This study took the first step to unravel spatial patterns in Fucus- associated invertebrate fauna, and the results illustrate how different environmental and biotic drivers shape these communities both on large and local scales.

AB  - Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major, Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula), mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked conifer stands.

AB  - The genetic structure of 33 natural Quercus robur stands in Finland was studied using 13 allozyme loci to analyze the effects of fragmentation in a wind-pollinated tree species. The present fragmented and discontinuous distribution of oak is a result of both short-term human impact and long-term climatic and geological change, including post-glacial land uplift. In accordance with general expectations, genetic diversity in small populations was lower than that in large populations, and differentiation among small populations was higher than that among large populations. Heterozygote deficiency was more pronounced in large populations, which is proposed to be a Wahlund effect created by either spatial sub-structuring or the existence of synchronized flowering lineages. Also genetic differentiation was higher and diversity lower in Finland than the estimates reported for Central Europe. There were differences in the genetic structure on sites of different geological age. We suggest that on most geologically old sites drift has a prominent effect whereas on younger sites also founder effects may be important.

AB  - Potential avoidance by wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) of high-altitude tourist resorts during winter was investigated in and near Rondane National Park in Norway. Distribution of reindeer was mapped using systematic snowmobile surveys during 1991-96 and compared with results from investigations of snow and vegetation characteristics. Maternal reindeer avoided a 10 km zone around the resort. Cows and calves increased in density from 0.6 +/- 0.6 reindeer km(-2) at 5-10 km from the resort to 7.6 +/- 2.2 reindeer km(-2) at 15-25 km from the resort. Bulls and yearlings were more tolerant, constituting nearly 92% of all observed animals 5-10 km from the resort. Nearly all animals avoided the zone within 5 km of the resort. There were no significant differences in distribution of lichen heath, hardness of snow, integrated ram hardness index (IRH) values, or snow depths on ridges with increasing distance from the resort. Available biomass of lichens was ca. 1200 g m(-2) 0-5 km from the resort and decreased to a low of ca. 250 g m(-2) at 15-25 km distance, a pattern that probably reflects overgrazing as a result of avoiding the tourist resort. Such avoidance implies reduced forage intake during winter, substantial reduction in available habitat, and lower productivity of the herd. The results suggest that avoidance by wild animals of sources of anthropogenic disturbance may involve long-term impacts, such as reductions in carrying capacity, that are more serious than those expected from direct physiological stress.

KW  - ASSESSMENT LCA
AB  - Rainbow trout is economically the most important cultivated fish in Finland. In this study, new knowledge on the energy consumption, emissions and environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland was generated. Methodologically the work was based on life cycle assessment (LCA) beginning from the extraction of raw materials and ending with the delivery of gutted fish to the retailers or for further processing. The environmental performances of production methods with different feeds, feed coefficients and technical emission reduction measures were assessed. The environmental impact assessment revealed that atmospheric emissions - originating mainly from the feed raw material production, feed manufacturing and transportation - make only a minor contribution to the total environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland. Phosphorus and nitrogen emissions from fish farms to waters are the most significant emissions from the point of view of the total environmental impacts. By using new, environmentally friendly feeds with increased feed efficiency it is possible to decrease the nitrogen and phosphorus loads significantly. Technical measures to decrease nutrient emissions to the waters reduce the phosphorus load but have only a minor effect on nitrogen. Energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources proved to be one of the key indicators for developing more sustainable aquacultural practices in Finland, although the major share of energy consumption associated with the production of rainbow trout takes place outside Finland.

AB  - Ecological classifications lie, explicitly or implicitly, at the foundation of biotic maps, which are in turn an essential tool in ecology and conservation. Techniques are being developed that make efficient use of scarce biological data to create those maps, such as those based on modelling, or predictive mapping. However, little attention has been paid to just how sensitive models are to the pattern they are designed to model. We have examined the predictive accuracy of classification models (Random Forests) relative to the classification detail of community types. The data are from a recently established Marine National Park off the west coast of Sweden where a map of benthic communities has been commissioned. A total of 447 georeferenced, underwater video sequences constituted the sample base for this study. Samples were classified according to increasing values of a similarity threshold, based on faunal composition, in a hierarchical cluster analysis framework. A random forest was fitted at each level of classification detail to predict the class membership of an independent set of samples, based on environmental (terrain and substrate-related) variables. Predictive accuracy was high (multiclass area under the curve, M-AUC = 0.79 to 0.81) across intermediate levels of classification detail (similarity cut off, 40 to 50%). Predictive accuracy was moderate (M-AUC = 0.73 to 0.78) at both ends of the spectrum of classificatory resolutions tested (cut offs: 30%, i.e. very coarse; 60%, very fine). These findings have ramifications in the 'classify first, then predict' approach to predictive mapping at the community level, as they show that calibrating classes before modelling them greatly enhances model reliability.

AB  - Background: Semi-natural pastures are unfertilized grasslands with a long history of traditional low-input grazing management. This kind of pastures are recognized for their high species richness. However, as a consequence of modernization of agriculture, many of the semi-natural pastures have been lost during the last century, leading to a serious threat to farmland biodiversity. Semi-natural pastures are relatively low in productivity. Hence, to increase profitability, farmers may want to give the grazing animals access to additional nutrient sources. This can be done either as supplementary feeding, or by fencing the semi-natural pastures into the same enclosure as improved, more nutrient-rich, pastures. These practices are, however, controversial. It is argued that since semi-natural pastures are species-rich partly because they are nutrient-poor, introducing additional nutrients into the system should be avoided. Accordingly, in Sweden, these interventions are often prohibited while receiving financial subsidies for management of semi-natural pastures. However, since many farmers are dependent on such support to maintain their pastures, these prohibitions often cause problems. The question has been raised whether giving the grazers access to additional nutrient sources really affect the biodiversity in semi-natural pastures, as is assumed. The primary aim of the proposed systematic review is to answer this question.
   Method: Peer-reviewed and grey literature will be searched for using bibliographic databases, search engines, specialist websites and stakeholder contacts. The references will be screened for relevance according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. The criteria will be tested and clarified iteratively, until consistency in interpretations is achieved. Thereafter, the literature will be screened in two stages, first based upon title and abstract and then by examining full texts. Full text screening will be performed with blinded decisions by two independent reviewers. Each relevant study will then be critically appraised, based on a set of predefined validity criteria. A narrative synthesis will be provided, outlining the evidence base in terms of bibliographic information and study metadata. If possible, quantitative syntheses based on meta-analyses will be performed. Identified relevant knowledge gaps will be highlighted and discussed.

AB  - Cover crops (CCs) are a diverse group of species that are sown simultaneously or after the cash crop either as monocrops or mixtures. A farmer survey with 1130 respondents was carried out with the aim to gain knowledge on CC species used by Finnish farmers, to understand how experienced farmers were with them, how experiences varied depending on farm and farmer characteristics, and to identify target groups for dissemination and policy measures. The studied groups were conventional and organic farms that had selected CCs as a registered measure in 2020 to receive agricultural payments. Our results show that farmers were experienced with a high number of CCs despite the high-latitude conditions. Only 11% of respondents had plenty of experience with CCs as mixtures. Farmers tended to favour CCs that were familiar to them as cash crops. Organic producers were usually more experienced than conventional farmers. Education increased curiosity towards CCs. Farmers who used more diverse cash crops tended to use more diverse CCs. In conclusion, especially farmers who have cereal-based systems and rotations should be a core group for knowledge sharing to support transition towards increased use of CCs and higher diversity of CC species in the future.

AB  - The authors analyze sustainable cultural landscapes through the lens of ecosystem services. Their case study focuses on transformation of the peri-urban landscape of the Stockholm region, Sweden. Peri-urban landscapes are characterized by diversified and fragmented land uses that are strongly related to urban lifestyles. The rapidly increasing trend for recreational horse keeping is replacing traditional agriculture. Horse keepers' and local government perspectives on horse keeping are examined, as well as the related demand for ecosystem services, which affects the landscape. The article is based on government documents, interviews with local government officials, and field visits to 16 horse-keeping facilities in two municipalities. Horse keeping was found important for sustaining cultural ecosystem services related to a rural cultural landscape and for maintaining traditional agriculture that provides provisioning ecosystem services. However, several differences between traditional agriculture and horse keeping that affect the demand for ecosystem services related to land use were found to shift the focus from provisioning services to recreational services. The authors conclude that horse keeping, as an emerging crosscutting issue in peri-urban landscapes, needs new more integrative planning processes that account for the full range of ecosystem services and links between cultural services and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Drainage of peatlands for forestry causes the water level to draw down, which results in subsidence of peat surface and increased peat bulk density (D-b) Later on, an accelerated rate of organic matter decomposition and the pressure of the growing tree stand further compacts the peat. We measured the peat D-b (0-80 cm) in 180 undrained and 209 drained (ca. 60-year-old) peatland sites representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland. D-b was affected by climatic conditions, nutrient status, and the tree stand volume of the site. D-b was significantly higher in drained than in undrained sites in all regions and site types: the mean (+/-SD) D-b in the whole material was 82 +/- 23 kg.m(-3) for the undrained sites and 133 +/- 22 kg.m(-3) for the drained sites. The increase in D-b was significant in all regions down to a depth of 60 cm and in southern Finland, even deeper than 80 cm. When the increase in carbon concentration was taken into consideration, the average postdrainage increase in the Db Of the 0-80 cm layer equalled the amount of carbon in the 54-cm layer in average undrained peat. As the reported subsidences of pear surface in forest drainage areas in Finland are usually below this limit, the carbon storage of peat is likely to increase after drainage.

TI  - Coastal zone management in Eastern Africa including the island states: A review of issues and initiatives
T2  - AMBIO
LA  - English
AB  - The shoreline of Eastern Africa and the island states of the western Indian Ocean extend over a distance of 11 000 linear km and its coastal zone is inhabited by between 30 and 35 million people. This is an area of remarkable geographical, ecological and human diversity with unique coastal habitats and high biodiversity. Widespread poverty, together with rapid population growth, inappropriate or poorly planned development, and a lack of integrated planning and management have resulted in the environmental degradation and resource depletion of many coastal areas, accompanied by increasing conflicts among stakeholders. Severe cases of coastal pollution and habitat destruction tend to be restricted to the immediate vicinity of major cities. However, these effects are gradually spreading to the less densely populated areas of the region. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) has been recognized as an effective resource-management approach in the region and a number of ICZM programs have been initiated at the regional, national and local levels. These programs are reviewed here, with particular reference to recent and ongoing ICZM initiatives supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) as well as other donor and UN agencies.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a conceptual analysis of cultural ecosystem services and how they are linked to the concepts of landscape, heritage and identity. It discusses how these cultural ecosystem services can be assessed and integrated into spatial and physical planning. The paper presents two case studies to shed light on the assessment process. A case study from Sweden combines an analysis of ecosystem services with methods for documenting cultural heritage values in landscapes. A second case study from the Arafura-Timor Seas combines an analysis of cultural ecosystem services with methods for assessment of priority environmental concerns at the seascape scale.
   We demonstrate that the methods from cultural heritage conservation provide tools for the analysis of historical values as well as historical drivers of change in landscapes that can add time-depth to more spatially focused ecosystem assessments. We propose that methods for valuation of cultural heritage and identity in landscapes are integrated into assessments of ecosystem services to inform policy making and physical and spatial planning for sustainable management of ecosystems and landscapes. This could also provide an approach for bringing about integrated implementation of conventions and instruments from the environmental and cultural heritage fields, respectively.

AB  - Grasslands represent key functional ecosystems due to their global contribution to macronutrients cycling and their role as reservoirs of microbial diversity. The strategic importance of these habitats rests on their involvement in carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere to the soil, while at the same time offering extensive sites for livestock rearing. In this study the management type, differentiated in pasture or meadow, was investigated as a variable for its possible effects on overall bacterial diversity and specific genes related to functional guilds. Its contribution was compared to that of other variables such as region, soil pH, and soil organic carbon, to rank their respective hierarchies in shaping microbial community structure. A latitudinal gradient across the European continent was studied, with three sampling groups located in Norway, France, and Northern Italy. The applied methods involved 16S DNA metabarcoding for taxonomic classification and determination of the relative abundance of the bacterial component, and quantitative PCR for the genetic determinants of bacterial and archaeal nitrification, intermediate or terminal denitrification, and nitrogen fixation. Results indicated that soil pH exerted the dominant role, affecting high taxonomy ranks and functions, along with organic carbon and region, with whom it partly covaried. In contrast, management type had no significant influence on microbial community structure and quantitative counts of functional genes. This suggests an ecological equivalence between the impacts of pasture and meadow practices, which are both perturbations that share the aspect of vegetation withdrawal by browsing or cutting, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents the first analysis of the diversity of regulating ecosystem services (ESS)-key variables for global environmental sustainability and change in an urban era across a globally important part of the urban world, urban Europe. We map the first pan-European pattern of regulating ecosystem services in urban core areas and their associated hinterlands and discuss data against the background of each city's land-use development history and planning culture. Upon selecting more than 300 cities, we used the Urban Atlas database and a straightforward calculation method to map three regulating ecosystem services. The main results of this study show (a) a heterogeneous distribution of regulating ecosystem services across European cities, (b) considerable provisioning differences between core cities and the hinterland, (c) a grouping of European regions according to their potential for urban ecosystem service provisioning and (d) an ecosystem services supply ranking for European cities. Considerable differences in urban ecosystem services were found among northern countries, such as Sweden and Finland, which are rich in supplying ecosystem services compared to the UK and Belgium, which, similar to Spanish and Greek cities, are characteristically low in ecosystem services provision. Our results provide the first overall picture of regulating services in urban EU-Europe and serve to inform decisions on the key aspects of future European policy and strategies involving urban nature, green spaces and health.

AB  - There is gradual recognition that cultural ecosystem services are critical building blocks for human well-being. Cultural and provisioning services are often intertwined, difficult to separate, and play salient roles in maintaining local identities. However, multiple studies assume links between cultural ecosystem services and human well-being, without quantifying relationships. We surveyed a representative sample of the population in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway, a region faced with great policy challenges around resource harvesting options. Our objective was to examine how public interest in management issues and attachment to place influences the appreciation of cultural ecosystem services benefits and if these benefits can act as satisfiers of wellbeing. Findings suggest that cultural ecosystem services provide a salient contribution to quality of life in this region, and help satisfy the needs of affection, understanding, creation, subsistence, identity, freedom, participation, protection and leisure. Cultural ecosystem services also constitute salient environmental attributes which contribute to the basic needs of being, having, doing and interacting. The importance of ecosystem services benefits for well-being increases with increasing attachment to the Lofoten environment. We argue that not only the ecosystem services benefits, but the values that emanate from the relationship between people and land should be given greater attention in land use policy.

AB  - To better understand the links between ecosystem service (ES) valuation and governance, we examine how local-level practitioners (i.e. the state forestry enterprise, tourism entrepreneurs, reindeer herders, a local NGO and a local hunting association) performed ES valuation through argumentation to promote certain interests in practical governance in the context of a forestry debate in northern Finland. Our case shows that monetary valuations may escalate disputes instead of providing neutral information. Furthermore, increasing transparency could be useful in gaining an understanding of the links between the (strategic) partiality of knowledge production and perceived ES values and trade-offs across stakeholder groups; this could also lead to a common view on various ES values and governance solutions. On the other hand, the stakeholders were eager to identify various benefits at diverse spatial and temporal scales in a strategic manner to defend or oppose prevailing land-use practises and ownership. However, while the positive identification and measurement of ESs is relevant, attention should also be paid to the practises of denying and questioning certain ES values. This is crucial to better understand how stakeholders perform ES valuations through argumentation and by this means shape and construct the governance options for and against particular ESs.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) are a key-component for sustainable management of human-environment systems, particularly in polar environments where effects of global changes are stronger. Taking local knowledge into account allows the valuation of ES experienced by stakeholders. It is the case for reindeer herders in Scandinavia, the ungulate being a keystone specie for subarctic socio-ecosystems. We adapt the ecosystem services assessment (ESA) proposed in Finland to the case study of the Gabna herders' community (Sweden), considering its cultural, geographical, and dynamic specificities. We used Saami ecological categories over the land-use categories of the CORINE Land Cover (CLC). We reassessed ES at the scale of the Gabna community and its seasonal pastures. We studied their evolution over 2000-2018, using CLC maps and Change CLC maps. Integration of Saami ecological categories in the classification of land cover did not substantially change the land cover distributions. However, ES were greater in Saami land use compared to other CLC categories. Cultural services were higher for summer and interseasonal pastures, dedicated to the reindeer reproduction, suggesting interactions between provisioning and cultural ES. Land cover changes are mostly represented by intensive forestry (5% of winter pastures) impeding reindeer grazing activity, while other seasonal pasture landscape composition stayed comparable along time. Consequently, forest activity, and in a lesser extent glacier melting and urbanization are the main drivers of the temporal evolution of ES. In the frame of pastoral landscapes conservation, the use of local terminologies opens perspectives for a holistic approach in environmental science. It raises the importance of local stakeholders as co-researchers in nature conservation studies.

AB  - The proposed mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) offers significant potential for conserving forests to reduce negative impacts of climate change. Tanzania is one of nine pilot countries for the United Nations REDD Programme, receives significant funding from the Norwegian, Finnish and German governments and is a participant in the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. In combination, these interventions aim to mitigate green-house gas emissions, provide an income to rural communities and conserve biodiversity. The establishment of the UN-REDD Programme in Tanzania illustrates real-world challenges in a developing country. These include currently inadequate baseline forestry data sets (needed to calculate reference emission levels), inadequate government capacity and insufficient experience of implementing REDD+-type measures at operational levels. Additionally, for REDD+ to succeed, current users of forest resources must adopt new practices, including the equitable sharing of benefits that accrue from REDD+ implementation. These challenges are being addressed by combined donor support to implement a national forest inventory, remote sensing of forest cover, enhanced capacity for measuring, reporting and verification, and pilot projects to test REDD+ implementation linked to the existing Participatory Forest Management Programme. Our conclusion is that even in a country with considerable donor support, progressive forest policies, laws and regulations, an extensive network of managed forests and increasingly developed locally-based forest management approaches, implementing REDD+ presents many challenges. These are being met by coordinated, genuine partnerships between government, non-government and community-based agencies.

AB  - Salvage logging operations often occur after large disturbances and usually leave behind a substantial quantity of residues, which is fundamental for maintaining soil fertility and facilitating ecosystem dynamics. This study aims to estimate the amount of logging residues following salvage operations categorized by two wood harvesting systems: Cut-To-Length (CTL) and Full-Tree System (FT). Logging residues in the harvested areas were sampled using linear transects and the data collected were divided into classes based on diameter. The quantity of residues was estimated using the Brown method for Fine Wood Debris (FWD) and the Van Wagner method for Coarse Wood Debris (CWD). Furthermore, the carbon and nutrient content associated with logging residues were also determined, considering their interaction with the soil organic layer. Overall, a higher quantity of FWD was detected in the sites cleared with the FT system and a higher quantity of CWD in the sites logged with the CTL system. Differences could be observed for all three years and systems considered, but only the third year reported statistically significant results (p<0.01). The soil and residue chemical analysis for carbon and nutrient contents revealed a high amount of carbon stored in a potential layer of 10 cm of soil (up to 85 Mg & BULL;C & BULL;ha-1), while only up to 15 Mg & BULL;C & BULL;ha-1 for the woody material.

AB  - Long-term effects of limestone treatment on fish populations in acidified lakes in Sweden have been examined since 1983 to assess the development and stability of fish assemblages after lime treatment. In total, 77 lakes were sampled twice using standardized methods between 1983 and 1988. The lakes were limed 1-16 yr before the second sampling. Physical and chemical variables and the fish data were reduced using PCA ordination and the resulting relationships were analyzed using linear regression and ANOVA. Relationships between the fish assemblage characteristics and the environmental factors were highly dependent on the species composition of the assemblages. The number and diversity of fish species were correlated with both the extent of acidification and habitat diversity of the lakes. The importance of species interactions after lime treatment was suggested by a negative relationship between changes in the scores of community along the first component of the fish PCA and changes along two of the other species components between the two samplings. Despite a weak tendency towards reduced variability in species proportions as time passed since the first liming, the development of community stability, expressed as lack of change in species proportions, was insignificant.

AB  - Several small-scale pyrolysis plants have been installed on Swedish farms and uptake is increasing in the Nordic countries. Pyrolysis plants convert biomass to biochar for agricultural applications and syngas for heating applications. These projects are driven by ambitions of achieving carbon dioxide removal, reducing environmental impacts, and improving farm finances and resilience. Before policy support for on-farm pyrolysis projects is implemented, a comprehensive environmental evaluation of these systems is needed. Here, a model was developed to jointly: (i) simulate operation of on-farm energy systems equipped with pyrolysis units; (ii) estimate biochar production potential and its variability under different energy demand situations and designs; and (iii) calculate life cycle environmental impacts. The model was applied to a case study farm in Sweden. The farm's heating system achieved net carbon dioxide removal through biochar carbon sequestration, but increased its impact in several other environmental categories, mainly due to increased biomass throughput. Proper dimensioning of heat constrained systems is key to ensure optimal biochar production, as biochar production potential of the case farm was reduced under expected climate change in Sweden. To improve the environmental footprint of future biochar systems, it is crucial that expected co-benefits from biochar use in agriculture are realised. The model developed here is available for application to other cases. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Norwegian government has decided that the aquaculture industry shall grow, provided that the growth is environmentally sustainable. Sustainability is scored based on the mortality of wild salmonids caused by the parasitic salmon lice. Salmon lice infestation pressure has traditionally been monitored through catching wild sea trout and Arctic char using nets or traps or by trawling after Atlantic salmon postsmolts. However, due to that the Norwegian mainland coastline is nearly 25 000 km, complementary methods that may be used in order to give complete results are needed. We have therefore developed an operational salmon lice model, which calculates the infestation pressure all along the coast in near real-time based on a hydrodynamical ocean model and a salmon lice particle tracking model. The hydrodynamic model generally shows a negative temperature bias and a positive salinity bias compared to observations. The modeled salmon lice dispersion correlates with measured lice on wild salmonids caught using traps or nets. This allows for using two complementary data sources in order to determine the infestation pressure of lice originating from fish farms on wild salmonids, and thereby provide an improved monitoring system for assessing risk and sustainability which forms the basis for knowledge-based advice to management authorities.

AB  - The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) enacted in New Zealand in 2008 allows forest growers to claim units for carbon sequestered by new forests. As afforestation is an important contributor to New Zealand meeting net emission targets there is interest in forecasting the rate of afforestation, particularly how it will vary with the price of carbon in the ETS. Consequently a model is developed to estimate afforestation rate from the Land Expectation Value (LEV) of 'traditional' forestry (i.e., revenues only from log sales), the LEV from the carbon trading opportunity that the ETS creates, and land value.
   Initially the relationship between afforestation rate and A grade log price during the period 1988 and 2008 is considered. Then the relationship between afforestation rate and LEV is evaluated. Initially the period up to 2008 is considered to evaluate the impact of 'traditional' forest profitability on the afforestation rate. Then the period from 2009 to 2015 is included and the impact of carbon is introduced. Finally the cost of land is introduced into the model.
   The land affordability model developed allows the future afforestation rate to be forecast from carbon price, log price and land value. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantifying vegetation structure and function is critical for modeling ecological processes, and an emerging challenge is to apply models at multiple spatial scales. Land surface heterogeneity is commonly characterized using rectangular pixels, whose length scale reflects that of remote sensing measurements or ecological models rather than the spatial scales at which vegetation structure and function varies. We investigated the 'optimum' pixel size and shape for averaging leaf area index (LAI) measurements in relatively large (85 m(2) estimates on a 600 x 600-m(2) grid) and small (0.04 m(2) measurements on a 40 x 40-m(2) grid) patches of sub-Arctic tundra near Abisko, Sweden. We define the optimum spatial averaging operator as that which preserves the information content (IC) of measured LAI, as quantified by the normalized Shannon entropy (E (S,n)) and Kullback-Leibler divergence (D (KL)), with the minimum number of pixels. Based on our criterion, networks of Voronoi polygons created from triangulated irregular networks conditioned on hydrologic and topographic indices are often superior to rectangular shapes for averaging LAI at some, frequently larger, spatial scales. In order to demonstrate the importance of information preservation when upscaling, we apply a simple, validated ecosystem carbon flux model at the landscape level before and after spatial averaging of land surface characteristics. Aggregation errors are minimal due to the approximately linear relationship between flux and LAI, but large errors of approximately 45% accrue if the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is averaged without preserving IC before conversion to LAI due to the nonlinear NDVI-LAI transfer function.

TI  - Modeling Stabilization of Crane-Induced Ship Motion With Gyroscopic Control Using the Moving Frame Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS
LA  - English
AB  - This paper presents a new method in multibody dynamics and applies it to the challenge of stabilizing ship motion induced by onboard crane operations. Norwegian industries are constantly assessing new technologies for more efficient and safer production in the aqua-cultural, renewable energy, and oil and gas industries. They share a common challenge to install new equipment and transfer personnel in a safe and controllable way between ships, fish farms, and oil platforms. This paper deploys the moving frame method (MFM) to analyze the motion induced by a crane, yet controlled by a gyroscopic inertial device. We represent the crane as a simple two-link system that transfers produce and equipment to and from barges. We analyze how an inertial flywheel can stabilize the ship during the transfer. Lie group theory and the work of Elie Cartan are the foundations of the MFM. This, together with a restriction on the variation of the angular velocity used in Hamilton's principle, enables an effective way of extracting the equations of motion for an open-loop system. Furthermore, this work displays the results in three-dimensional (3D) on cell phones. The long-term results of this work lead to a robust 3D active compensation method for loading/unloading operations offshore. Finally, the simplicity of the analysis anticipates the impending time of artificial intelligence when machines, equipped with onboard central processing units and internet protocol addresses, are empowered with learning modules to conduct their operations.

AB  - Thirty years have passed since the completion of land reclamation and the planting of broad-leaved evergreen trees at the Expo'70 Commemorative Park, which was developed in an urban area of Osaka, the second largest city in Japan. Canopy closure and biomass development of the forests in the park are proof of the success of the revegetation of laurel forests. However, because low penetration of solar radiation to the forest floor seemed to restrict the diversity of forest floor vegetation, we carried out adaptive forest management to increase the diversity. To improve the light environment on the forest floor, we created four artificial gaps, each 15 m x 15 m. Further, to establish a new diverse population from seed, we spread forest topsoil from a secondary forest containing a diverse seedbank over these gaps. The average gap fraction under the intact canopy was 0.09. Partial removal of trees (52% of basal area) increased the average gap fraction to 0.19 and heavy removal (more than 88% of basal area) increased it to 0.29-0.54. Species number and density of germinated seedlings became significantly greater in the gaps than under the intact canopy. Many seedlings arose in the gaps from the seedbanks that have built up over the last 30 years in the topsoil of the park forest. Only 1 year after creation of gaps, the spread of forest topsoil had resulted in the germination of six species that did not exist in the park before, indicating the possibility of creating diverse populations. In the partial removal plot, the seedling density was the highest, but the seedling death rates were also large and the seedlings grew the least. Differences in the light environment as determined mainly by removal intensity might affect patterns of revegetation from a seedbank. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi play pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning. Here, we studied the vertical differentiation of root-associated fungi (RAF) in temperate forests. We analysed RAF assemblages in the organic and mineral soil from 150 experimental forest plots across three biogeographic regions spanning a distance of about 800 km. Saprotrophic RAF showed the highest richness in organic and symbiotrophic RAF in mineral soil. Symbiotrophic RAF exhibited higher relative abundances than saprotrophic fungi in both soil layers. Beta-diversity of RAF was mainly due to turnover between organic and mineral soil and showed regional differences for symbiotrophic and saprotrophic fungi. Regional differences were also found for different phylogenetic levels, i.e., fungal orders and indicator species in the organic and mineral soil, supporting that habitat conditions strongly influence differentiation of RAF assemblages. Important exceptions were fungal orders that occurred irrespective of the habitat conditions in distinct soil layers across the biogeographic gradient: Russulales and Cantharellales (ectomycorrhizal fungi) were enriched in RAF assemblages in mineral soil, whereas saprotrophic Polyporales and Sordariales and ectomycorrhizal Boletales were enriched in RAF assemblages in the organic layer. These results underpin a phylogenetic signature for niche partitioning at the rank of fungal orders and suggest that RAF assembly entails two strategies encompassing flexible and territorial habitat colonization by different fungal taxa.

AB  - Natural events and human activities cause changes in landscape structure. Landscape metrics are used as a useful tool to study landscape trends and ecological processes related to the landscape structure. These metrics are commonly calculated on wall-to-wall raster data from remote sensing. A recent trend is to use sample data to estimate landscape metrics. In this study, point sampling was used to estimate a vector-based and distance dependent contagion metric. The metric is an extension of the established contagion. The statistical properties, for both unconditional and conditional contagions, were assessed by a point (point pairs) sampling experiment in maps from the National Inventory of landscapes in Sweden. Random and systematic sampling designs were tested for nine point distances and five sample sizes and for two classification systems. The systematic design showed slightly smaller root mean square error (RMSE) and bias than the random design. Both true and estimated values were calculated using computer programs in FORTRAN, which was specifically written for the purpose of the study. For a given sample size, RMSE and bias increased with increasing point distance. The estimator of unconditional contagion had acceptable RMSE and bias for moderate sample sizes, but in the conditional case the bias (and thus the RMSE) was unacceptably large. The main reason for this is that small classes (by area) affect both the true value of the contagion and are often missing in the sample. The method proposed can be adopted in gradient-based model of landscape structure where no distinct border is assumed between polygons. The method can also be applied in field-based inventories.

AB  - Macroecology and biogeography of microscopic organisms (any living organism smaller than 2 mm) are quickly developing into fruitful research areas. Microscopic organisms also offer the potential for testing predictions and models derived from observations on larger organisms due to the feasibility of performing lab and mesocosm experiments. However, more empirical knowledge on the similarities and differences between micro- and macro-organisms is needed to ascertain how much of the results obtained from the former can be generalised to the latter. One potential misconception, based mostly on anedoctal evidence rather than explicit tests, is that microscopic organisms may have wider ecological tolerance and a lower degree of habitat specialisation than large organisms. Here we explicitly test this hypothesis within the framework of metacommunity theory, by studying host specificify in the assemblages of bdelloid rotifers (animals about 350 mm in body length) living in different species of lichens in Sweden. Using several regression-based and ANOVA analyses and controlling for both spatial structure and the kind of substrate the lichen grow over (bark vs rock), we found evidence of significant but weak species-specific associations between bdelloids and lichens, a wide overlap in species composition between lichens, and wide ecological tolerance for most bdelloid species. This confirms that microscopic organisms such as bdelloids have a lower degree of habitat specialisation than larger organisms, although this happens in a complex scenario of ecological processes, where source-sink dynamics and geographic distances seem to have no effect on species composition at the analysed scale.

AB  - We examined fire history and forest age distribution in an unmanaged, Picea-dominated landscape in the Paanajarvi wilderness, located in northeastern Fennoscandia and northwest Russia. Maximum tree age was determined in 61 systematically located study plots in an area of about 6600 ha. Fire scars were examined in living and dead trees in the study plots and elsewhere in the study area. Charcoal and pollen analyses of peat were performed on samples from two locations. Fires had been rare in the landscape. Nearly half of the dendrochronologically dated fires occurred in a distinct and short period, from 1859 to 1889, in the northeastern part of the area. This nonrandom occurrence of fires, together with the observed signs of past human influence, suggests an anthropogenic origin for the majority of the fires. The fact that 95% of the study area consisted of forests older than 120 years reflects the end of the occurrence of fires in the 1880s. Pollen analysis from the southwestern part of the study area showed that the site had been dominated by Picea at least during the last millennium. Charcoal analysis from the same site indicated that likely more than 1000 years had elapsed since the last fire. In general, the results suggest that the abundance of old forests, with the oldest trees being approximately 300 years of age, belongs to the natural state of a Picea-dominated landscape.

AB  - 1. The increased length of forest clear-cut edges is considered to be one of the main ecological consequences of silviculture. The effects vary over the landscape, and studies have shown that aspect is one important factor determining the extent of microclimatic edge effects across forest clear-cut boundaries. However, little is known about the relationship between contrasts in microclimate at edges and responses of ecological processes and biodiversity, such as growth, decomposition and species distributions.
   2. A field experiment was conducted in the boreal forest of northern Sweden to assess the effect of aspect at north- and south-facing edges using mosses as bioindicators. The growth of two species (Hylocomium splendens and Hylocomiastrum umbratum) was evaluated during one growing season. Samples of each species were planted in pots at eight north- and eight south-facing forest clear-cut edges.
   3. Growth increased exponentially with distance from the edge to the interior, and there was a significant effect both in north- and south-facing edges. The percentage decline in growth at the edge was larger in the south- than in the north-facing edges.
   4. The spatial extent of the edge effect, when measured at the point of 90% of interior growth, was similar between north- and south-facing edges, although it differed between the two species evaluated.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The difference in exposure to sunlight between north- and south-facing edges was shown to modify the magnitude of the growth of a poikilohydric organism at the very edge, but not the depth of the edge influence. Aspect should be taken into account in management plans for conservation of boreal forests. In the northern hemisphere, wider buffers of uncut forest should be left at the south side than at the north side of retained forest patches. Those forest interior species that are most sensitive to alterations in microclimate will, however, need equal protection from edge effects at all aspects.

AB  - Aim To investigate the relative role of local versus landscape factors for local species diversity of snails and slugs in conservation forests. In landscapes with small, isolated patches of semi-natural habitats, many species that require large habitat areas have disappeared or are threatened. We asked whether small sedentary taxa that depend on local conditions, such as molluscs, are affected if total habitat area decreases in the landscape.
   Location Temperate broadleaved and oak-rich forest in southern Sweden.
   Methods We sampled molluscs in 25 small conservation forests that are well-spaced out over a large region. In each forest, sampling was conducted in two plots, each of 1 ha, separated by about 25-100 m. Factors potentially influencing local diversity of molluscs were measured in the plots and in the surrounding landscape at different scales (in space and time) and were analysed by stepwise multiple regression and ordination (PCA and NMS).
   Results We recorded 53 species, and mean species richness per forest (plots pooled) was 22.6. The pH of the plant litter predicted both species richness and composition; other local (plot) factors of lower importance were canopy openness, stony ground and tree species. The area of conservation forest (woodland key habitat) within 10 km of plots was positively associated with species richness, and was also related to species composition. Openness of the landscape (agriculture) was a negative factor, but historical plot openness (1938-59) seemed to be unimportant. In addition, climate/topography (temperature and altitude) also predicted species composition of the sites.
   Main conclusions We rejected the hypothesis that microhabitat factors alone, or mainly, determine local species richness and composition of land molluscs. These representatives of small, sedentary organisms seem to be substantially influenced by the surrounding landscape, which should be considered in conservation work and in plans for the protection of forest biodiversity.

AB  - The need for knowledge on how to sustain environmental values increases along with the rising rate of tourism at the northern tourist destinations. Based on the expertise of the Botanical Gardens of the University of Oulu and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at Lapland Vocational College, the LABPLANT -task of Tourist Destinations as Landscape Laboratories - Tools for Sustainable Tourism (LANDSCAPE LAB) has concentrated on finding and producing hardy plants that meet the needs of sustainable landscaping and restoration in northern tourism areas. The subproject concentrates on the problems that the lack of green knowledge' generates at tourist destinations. Species-specific plant propagation methods have been developed.. and over 100 hardy plant species have been propagated that can withstand the northern winter. The species were planted in the LANDSCAPE LAB demonstration areas. The demonstration areas in the Pallas-Yllastunturi National Park and at the Yllas and Levi tourist destinations in the fell area of Finnish Lapland serve as examples of sustainable landscaping and restoration in northern tourism areas in vivo. They are also valuable sites for future studies. The demonstration areas and plant collections at the Botanical Gardens and Lapland Vocational College also serve as gene banks. LABPLANT - task has produced a manual on hardy northern plants. The manual recommends and lists the plant species for the growing conditions in the North and provides examples of their use in different habitats.

AB  - European permanent grasslands are multifunctional landscapes that deliver an important mix of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of future policies linked to landscape and agricultural practices requires consideration of citizen perceptions of, and priorities for, benefits (e.g. ecosystem services) demanded from permanent grasslands. This exploratory research aimed to expand understanding of citizens' perceptions and socio-cultural valuation of grassland landscapes, ecosystem service provision and management across Europe in order to inform future research. Fifteen focus groups with residents of rural areas, urban areas, and young adults from rural areas (aged 18-26) (N = 104), were conducted across five European countries (Spain, Sweden, UK, Switzerland and the Czech Republic) between 2020 and 2021. Overall, participants perceived grassland landscapes positively, describing connection to the landscape through experience, emotions, environmental characteristics, activity, access, and cultural identity. Prioritisation of ecosystem services from grassland varied between countries, influenced by grassland system diversity, and complex socio-cultural and socio-economic differences. Rural dwellers, including rural youth, perceived more benefits from grasslands than urban dwellers. Perceptions of problems were related to reduction, degradation and abandonment of grassland, and varied between urban and rural dwellers. Consumer education about the value of grasslands was perceived as vital in ensuring sustainable management and use of these landscapes. Citizens across different countries shared farming ideals relating to farming for biodiversity. These findings can help ensure that policies surrounding landscape and agricultural practices align with societal perspectives and priorities to effectively deliver multifunctional, valued, sustainable grassland systems.

AB  - Fixing carbon dioxide (CO2) as carbonates using silicate-based materials is an interesting alternative option for storage of carbon dioxide. Suitable magnesium-rich rocks are distributed throughout the world. The magnesium silicate deposits in Eastern Finland alone could be sufficient for storing 10 Mt CO2 each year during a period of 200-300 years. Rocks potentially suitable for carbonation are already mined, processed, piled, and stored at mines producing industrial minerals and metals. Two process schemes were constructed based on previous experimental results with producing magnesium carbonates from serpentinite, a serpentine ore. The thermal stability of the produced hydromagnesite was also assessed using thermogravimetric analysis. Although pure hydromagnesite can be produced that is thermally stable up to 300 degrees C, the Process scheme studied requires recycling of large amounts of sodium hydroxide and acid. Since the current methods for recycling the spent chemicals are expensive and would presumably Cause CO2 emissions due to power consumption, the process studied might be suitable for producing valuable mineral and metal products from serpentinite, but probably not for CO2 capture and storage.

AB  - As a part of the Integrated Monitoring (IM) Programme of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems, the macroinvertebrate community of a pristine forest lake was monitored from 1990 up to the present. Lake Iso Hietajarvi is a small and shallow, weakly stratified oligotrophic headwater lake situated in Patvinsuo National Park, eastern Finland. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled annually, once in autumn at depths of 3 - 4 m (sublittoral zone) and at 7 in (profundal zone). The water quality of the lake and meteorological characteristics in the area were monitored during the same period. The inter-annual variation in macroinvertebrate abundance and taxonomic composition in the lake unaffected by human activities is described, compared across depth zones and related to environmental variation. The annual variation in density and taxa richness was relatively small, being proportionately greater in the profundal zone. There was a considerable year-to-year variation in the abundance of common and dominant taxa. Most taxa were always few in number and occurred only occasionally - in 1 or 2 years - in both depth zones. The inter-annual community persistence (constancy of taxa occurrences) and stability (consistency of relative abundance of taxa) as measured by the Sorensen distance, were however, relatively high and generally greater in the sublittoral zone. The patterns of variation in density, taxa richness, abundance of dominant taxa and community persistence and stability were generally different in the two zones compared, and few correlations with the measured environmental variables were found. Inter-annual stability and persistence, however, closely traced the course of wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation index, suggesting that the rate of local community change may be linked with large-scale climatic variation in a subtle way. The implications of the results are discussed in the context of biomonitoring.

AB  - This paper analyzes trends and possible future developments in global wood-product markets and discusses implications for the Swedish forest sector. Four possible futures, or scenarios, are considered, based on qualitative scenario analysis. The scenarios are distinguished principally by divergent futures with respect to two highly influential factors driving change in global wood-product markets, whose future development is unpredictable. These so-called critical uncertainties were found to be degrees to which: (i) current patterns of globalization will continue, or be replaced by regionalism, and (ii) concern about the environment, particularly climate change, related policy initiatives and customer preferences, will materialize. The overall future of the Swedish solid wood-product industry looks bright, irrespective of which of the four possible futures occurs, provided it accommodates the expected growth in demand for factory-made, energy-efficient construction components. The prospects for the pulp and paper industry in Sweden appear more ambiguous. Globalization is increasingly shifting production and consumption to the Southern hemisphere, adversely affecting employment and forest owners in Sweden. Further, technical progress in information and communication technology (ICT) is expected to lead to drastic reductions in demand for newsprint and printing paper. Chemical pulp producers may profit from a growing bio-energy industry, since they could manufacture new, high-value products in integrated bio-refineries. Mechanical pulp producers cannot do this, however, and might suffer from higher prices for raw materials and electricity.

AB  - We estimated the magnitude of the radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in albedo following the forestation of peatlands, and calculated the net RF by taking into account the changes in both the albedo and the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes during one forest rotation. Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil GHG fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the RF due to increased atmospheric GHG concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced RF was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative RF, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced RF mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the RF, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

AB  - Phytophagous insects can have severe impacts on forested ecosystems in outbreak situations but their contribution to flows of energy and matter is otherwise not so well known. Identifying the role of phytophagous insects in forested ecosystems is partly hindered by the difficulty of combining results from population and community ecology with those from ecosystem ecology. In our study we compared the effects of aphids and leaf-feeding lepidopterous larvae on the epiphytic micro-organisms in the canopies of spruce, beech and oak, and on the vertical flow of energy and nutrients from the canopies down to the forest floor. We particularly searched for patterns resulting from endemic herbivory rather than outbreak situations. Excreta of lepidopterous larvae and aphids promoted the growth of epiphytic micro-organisms (bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi) on needles and leaves, which suggests that micro-organisms were energy limited. Leachates from needles and leaves of infested trees contained higher concentrations of dissolved organic C and lower concentrations of NH4-N and NO3-N, relative to uninfested trees. The seasonal abundance of herbivores and microorganisms significantly affected the dynamics of throughfall chemistry; for instance, concentrations of inorganic N were lower underneath infested than uninfested trees during June and July. There was little difference between the chemistry of soil solutions collected from the forest floor beneath infested and uninfested trees. Thus, under moderate to low levels of infestation the effects of above-ground herbivory seems to be obscured in the soil through buffering biological processes.

AB  - The use of peatlands and the multiple but mutually exclusive ecosystem services they provide is a highly debated issue worldwide. We used a participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to address multiple value dimensions and trade-offs related to peatland ecosystem services in Southern Finland. We evaluated five peat land policy scenarios against provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services as well as socio-economic factors, and engaged key stakeholders in framing the assessment and assigning criteria weights. The MCDA process showed that while peat extraction can basically be reconciled with preserving the most important biodiversity values in Finland, the conflict between peat extraction and carbon stock as well as water quality impacts and the related amenity values is irreconcilable. The role of the participatory MCDA process in promoting learning and reflection was smaller than expected but it did facilitate learning about the flows of peatland ecosystem services. The role of the participants was important not only in making value judgements but also in contributing to the impact assessment, thereby supporting the calls for transdisciplinarity in ecosystem service assessments.

AB  - Aim
   Aquatic-terrestrial ecotones are vulnerable to climate change, and degradation of the emergent aquatic macrophyte zone would have severe ecological consequences for freshwater, wetland and terrestrial ecosystems. Our aim was to uncover future changes in boreal emergent aquatic macrophyte zones by modelling the occurrence and percentage cover of emergent aquatic vegetation under different climate scenarios in Finland by the 2050s.
   Location
   Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods
   Data derived from different GIS sources were used to estimate future emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions in all catchments in Finland (848 in total). We used generalized additive models (GAM) with a full stepwise selection algorithm and Akaike information criterion to explore the main environmental determinates (climate and geomorphology) of emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions, which were derived from the national subclass of CORINE land-cover classification. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was cross-validated, using percentage of explained deviance and the area under the curve derived from the receiver-operating characteristic plots.
   Results
   Our results indicated that emergent aquatic macrophytes will expand their distributions northwards from the current catchments and percentage cover will increase in all of the catchments in all climate scenarios. Growing degree-days was the primary determinant affecting distributions of emergent aquatic macrophytes. Inclusion of geomorphological variables clearly improved model performance in both model exercises compared with pure climate variables.
   Main conclusions
   Emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions will expand due to climate change. Many emergent aquatic plant species have already expanded their distributions during the past decades, and this process will continue in the years 2051-80. Emergent aquatic macrophytes pose an increasing overgrowth risk for sensitive macrophyte species in boreal freshwater ecosystems, which should be acknowledged in management and conservation actions. We conclude that predictions based on GIS data can provide useful 'first-filter' estimates of changes in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones.

AB  - 1. The species diversity of adjacent landscapes influences the conservation or restoration of several animal groups in urban areas, but the effect on birds is unclear. To address this question, we compared bird species richness (BSR) and community composition between periurban (area surrounding the town) and urban (suburban and centre areas) landscapes across three spatial scales.
   2. At a large biogeographical scale (temperate and boreal climatic zone), relationships between the BSR of urban areas and their surrounding landscapes were examined in a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. In general, BSR was negatively correlated with latitude and urbanization. The BSR of suburban and centre landscapes correlated positively with the BSR of periurban landscapes. However, latitudinal effects were also involved, as BSR in urban and periurban landscapes declined as town latitude increased. Similarity indices were low (50%) between periurban and centre bird communities.
   3. At a regional scale, we assessed winter bird data from several towns within three regions of temperate and boreal countries (western France, northern Finland and eastern Canada). The type of periurban landscape., number of inhabitants and town diameter did not affect BSR. BSR was similar between the cities of a given biogeographical area. Bird communities were more similar between similar habitat types of different cities than between different habitats of the same city.
   4. At a local scale, we tested the influence of proximity to the periurban landscape on BSR in parks of western French towns of different size. Neither BSR nor community similarity changed in relation to the distance of the park from the periurban landscape.
   5. Guild composition according to diet and feeding habitat did not vary between urban and periurban locations at regional or local scales.
   6. We conclude that, at regional and local scales, urban bird communities are independent of the bird diversity of adjacent landscapes, and that local features are more important than surrounding landscapes in determining BSR. Whatever the biodiversity quality of the periurban landscape, site-specific actions such as shrub and tree planting, water restoration and increasing vegetation diversity can change bird diversity in towns and improve the quality of human-wildlife contacts.

AB  - Energy generated by land-based wind power is expected to play a crucial role in the decarbonisation of the economy. However, with the looming biodiversity and nature crises, spatial allocation of wind power can no longer be considered solely a trade-off against local disamenity costs. Emphasis should also be put on wider environmental impacts, especially if these challenge the sustainability of the renewable energy transition. We suggest a modelling system for selecting among a pool of potential wind power plants (WPPs) by combining an energy system model with a GIS analysis of WPP sites and surrounding viewscapes. The modelling approach integrates monetised local disamenity and carbon sequestration costs and places constraints on areas of importance for wilderness and biodiversity (W&B). Simulating scenarios for the Norwegian energy system towards 2050, we find that the southern part of Norway is the most favourable region for wind power siting when only the energy system surplus is considered. However, when local disamenity costs (and to a lesser extent carbon costs) and W&B constraints are added successively to the scenarios, it becomes increasingly beneficial to site WPPs in the northern part of Norway. We find that the W&B constraints have the largest impact on the spatial distribution of WPPs, while the monetised costs of satisfying these constraints are relatively small. Overall, our results show that there is a trade-off between local disamenities and loss of W&B. Siting wind power plants outside the visual proximity of households has a negative impact on W&B.

AB  - The Norwegain mountains have had a central role in the subsistence agroecosystems by providing vast biological resources for humans and their livestock since 4000-3500 BP as indicated by paleoecological records. Later with the development of the summer farming system the use of the mountains was intensified. This long-term use of the mountains has shaped a montane cultural landscape by livestock grazing, mowing for hay, fuel collection and a variety of other uses. The result is a significant increase of the grassland areas at the expense of the forest. Those semi-natural grasslands and heathlands with specific biological diversity have until recently dominated the mountains but are today decreasing due to forest invasion - which in turn is a result of changes in human land use. The present paper focuses on changes in landscape pattern and differences in landscape development in two mountain valleys with summer farming activities, in Mid-Norway, over the period 1960s-1990s, and seeks to interpret the changes in relation to differential land use and environmental factors. This study contributes examples from human shaped ecosystems in mountains where the fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is addressed. A set of landscape pattern indices commonly used in landscape ecological studies is also used here, and their ecological relevance in the present context is dealt with. The implications of changed land use for biodiversity conservation in those mountains and the relationships to future sustainable agriculture is also briefly discussed.

AB  - This paper summarizes a forest ecosystem model developed for assessing the effects of climate change on the functioning and structure of boreal coniferous forests under the assumption that temperature and precipitation are the basic dimensions of the niche occupied by any one tree species. Special attention is paid to specifying weather patterns to a level representing the time constant of different physiological and ecological processes relevant to the regeneration, growth and death of trees. The long-term dynamics of the forest ecosystem have been coupled with climatic factors at the level of mechanisms, e.g., photosynthesis and respiration, in terms of the energy flow through the ecosystem. Furthermore, hydrological and nutrient cycles couple the dynamics of the forest ecosystem with climate change through soil processes representing the thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil and the decomposition of litter and humus with the mineralization of nutrients.
   Simulations for southern Finland (62 degrees N) and northern Finland (66 degrees N) indicated that a transient increase in temperature by 4 degrees C over a period of 100 years could substantially increase soil temperature and reduce soil moisture in forest ecosystems dominated by Scots pine. At the same time, the temperature increase could enhance photosynthetic production and consequent stemwood growth in southern Finland by about 8% and in northern Finland by about 19%. Given the current temperature but elevating CO2 concentration, the increase in photosynthesis in southern Finland could be about 23% and in northern Finland about 21%, but the concurrent elevation in temperature and CO2 concentration increased photosynthesis by about 32% in southern Finland and by about 40% in northern Finland. Transpiration decreased by as much as 10-20% under the changing climate with the consequence that water-use efficiency increased by as much as 25-45%, the higher values representing southern Finland.

AB  - QuestionsCan signs of 19th century grassland management, which can be observed in the flora immediately (2-4yrs) after clear-cutting in boreonemoral Sweden, still remain 4yrs later? Do the effects from the time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant species?
   LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden.
   MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time.
   ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64% higher total species richness and 110% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of finding a forest species increased.
   ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation. Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management while also acknowledging the potential conflicts between conservation and production. The results may pertain to other countries with similar land-use histories.

AB  - Meltwater streams connect the glacial cryosphere with downstream ecosystems. Dissolved and particulate matter exported from glacial ecosystems originates from contrasting supraglacial and subglacial environments, and exported microbial cells have the potential to serve as ecological and hydrological indicators for glacial ecosystem processes. Here, we compare exported microbial assemblages from the meltwater of 24 glaciers from six (sub)Arctic regions - the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet, Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island) in west Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, western Norway, and southeast Alaska - differing in their lithology, catchment size, and climatic characteristics, to investigate spatial and environmental factors structuring exported meltwater assemblages. We found that 16S rRNA gene sequences of all samples were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, with Verrucomicrobia also common in Greenland localities. Clustered OTUs were largely composed of aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs capable of degrading a wide variety of carbon substrates. A small number of OTUs dominated all assemblages, with the most abundant being from the genera Polaromonas, Methylophilus, and Nitrotoga. However, 16-32% of a region's OTUs were unique to that region, and rare taxa revealed unique metabolic potentials and reflected differences between regions, such as the elevated relative abundances of sulfur oxidizers Sulfuricurvum sp. and Thiobacillus sp. at Svalbard sites. Meltwater alpha diversity showed a pronounced decrease with increasing latitude, and multivariate analyses of assemblages revealed significant regional clusters. Distance-based redundancy and correlation analyses further resolved associations between whole assemblages and individual OTUs with variables primarily corresponding with the sampled regions. Interestingly, some OTUs indicating specific metabolic processes were not strongly associated with corresponding meltwater characteristics (e.g., nitrification and inorganic nitrogen concentrations). Thus, while exported assemblage structure appears regionally specific, and probably reflects differences in dominant hydrological flowpaths, OTUs can also serve as indicators for more localized microbially mediated processes not captured by the traditional characterization of bulk meltwater hydrochemistry. These results collectively promote a better understanding of microbial distributions across the Arctic, as well as linkages between the terrestrial cryosphere habitats and downstream ecosystems.

AB  - Kelp forests are highly productive habitats which support important marine species and ecosystem services including coastal protection and carbon storage. Demand is increasing for commercial products from wild and cultivated kelp, however questions remain on how harvesting of wild kelp can be managed and governed in a sustainable and adaptive way. This paper analyses and contrasts the institutional arrangements for wild kelp harvesting in Scotland and Norway by examining three recent governance processes through document analysis and participant observation. We investigate to what extent the regimes display three foundational aspects of adaptive governance: local governance and participation; the use of knowledge; and legal adaptive capacity. Industrial harvesting has been underway for decades in Norway but is not yet practiced in Scotland, although kelp availability and traditional usage are similar. In Scotland, following extensive public objection in response to proposed industrial harvesting, a legal restriction was adopted in 2019 that prohibits industrial harvesting of whole plants, and the regulatory regime remains under review. In Norway, governance of kelp harvesting is designed to be adaptive and inclusive through periodic review of regional harvesting regulations, yet has not been adjusted despite contestation from stakeholders. In both cases, adaptive governance processes are indicated but are not influential on outcomes. Our paper reveals several obstacles to knowledge-based adaptive governance in practice. First, it is insufficient to create the processes of engagement and participation - these must be empowered to influence governance and remain legitimate. In both cases, the regimes remain hierarchical and dominated by central agencies, even though structures for local governance are available. Second, integrating scientific and local knowledge was shown to be difficult, and mechanisms to debate and negotiate risks and benefits were lacking. In each case, diverging perspectives on kelp harvesting were sustained even though final outcomes were reached, and consensus was elusive. Third, adaptive capacity of applicable legal instruments is of crucial importance, with differences apparent in capacity to enable on-going revision (as in Norway) and limit future change (in Scotland). Poor co-ordination between legal instruments also leads to complications between actors with different mandates and policy objectives. Recommendations are made for an adaptive approach to protect and manage kelp as a critical habitat.

AB  - This case study from Stockholm County, Sweden, explores practitioners' experiences of barriers and bridges in municipal planning practices to support actions for ecosystem services. This qualitative study is based on information gathered from a focus group, workshops, and semi-structured interviews, which aided in identifying key factors for integrating ecosystem services in municipal planning. We identified 10 key factors divided into three themes: (i) regulatory framework and political support, (ii) local organizational capacity, and (iii) local adaptation of tools and practices. In particular, the practitioners pointed to the need for the development of legal support and regulations for ecosystem services on the national and EU policy levels. Furthermore, the need for local capacity building and understanding of ecosystem services as well as increased regional support to enhance local knowledge exchange and learning was emphasized. Also, in a decentralized local governance system such as in Sweden, to fully implement ecosystem services in urban planning for sustainable development, locally adapted practical tools and monitoring procedures were considered important.

AB  - In order to understand the relationship between tree diversity and forest productivity, it is crucial to understand what is going on at the level of individual trees, since each tree responds to the prevailing environmental conditions and interacts with his neighbours. We explored tree interactions in 53 forest plots in northern Belgium (TREEWEB platform) containing all possible combinations of pedunculate oak, beech and red oak. We cored 307 trees and determined the average annual basal area increment for the last 10 years for each sampled tree. We investigated the importance of neighbourhood competition, tree age an size for tree-level growth and then scaled up the species-specific tree growth to stand-level productivity. By exploring how competition, tree age and size varied along the studied gradient of tree species richness, we were able to explain the observed species-specific tree level and stand-level growth along the tree species richness gradient. We found no relationship between tree species richness and forest productivity, due to contrasting growth patterns of the three species along the richness gradient: the growth of pedunculate oak decreased, growth of beech was constant and growth of red oak increased along the tree species richness gradient. Increased heterospecific competition was the main reason for the observed lower growth of pedunculate oak in mixtures, whereas variation in tree age and size along the studied tree species richness gradient were the main drivers for the observed growth patterns of beech and red oak. Species-specific age differences along the tree species richness gradient could be linked with the species composition. We observed a multi-aged stand structure with the light-demanding pedunculate oak being older than the more shade-tolerant beech and red oak, probably a consequence of management interventions needed to enable long-term coexistence of light-demanding and shade-tolerant species. Our study highlights that the management history of mature forests may influence diversity-productivity relationships and should therefore be taken into account during the analysis.

AB  - An increased understanding of regional surface water quality and the key factors which differentiate regional from local differences is necessary for monitoring impacts such as mountain pine beetle infestation and related land management practices. This study develops a framework to identify water quality indicators which differentiate parameters influenced by rock type, by relatively short term anthropogenic activities, and those resulting from longer term climatic variability. Rock type was an overriding factor related to stream water chemistry in this British Columbia case study; with differences between watersheds differentiated by Ca, EC, Al and Fe. Grouping watersheds by their dominant rock type permitted the investigation of water quality with other watershed characteristics. The % forest cover, % pine cover, and dominant runoff processes demonstrated significant relationships with soluble cations, metals, turbidity and total organic carbon. Turbidity levels showed low variability, and relationships with mountain pine beetle were not strong; suggesting the need for more detailed data sets, selective monitoring of storm events, and longer term monitoring to improve predictive capacity.

AB  - Conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, ecosystems and their services are key principles behind the establishment of "Biosphere Reserves". Mapping of ecosystem services is one of the activities that is expected to increase the knowledge of sustainable land use planning. The Biosphere Reserves, established by the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme, aims to find the balance between nature conservation, use of natural resources, recreation and other culturerelated activities. For this purpose, the ecosystem services approach is a promising tool for examining the relationships between people and nature in practice. This study applies the ecosystem services approach and examines which ecosystem services are perceived to be relevant in the North Karelia Biosphere Reserve in Eastern Finland. The results of a matrix method, with expert-based approach, showed that particularly oldgrowth forests and undrained open and forested mires have a broader potential to provide different ecosystem services. Water and urban areas are considered important for cultural services. However, these areas cover only a relatively small area altogether. The results of the ecosystem services assessment were compared to areas of high biodiversity, as defined by local biodiversity experts. The areas with high capacity for ecosystem services provision (from now on "high ecosystem services areas") were found in areas with high biodiversity. In most cases, these areas are already under protection. The results also showed that ambiguity is an issue with the use of the ecosystem services concept in both stakeholder and expert evaluations.

AB  - Dispersal is important for determining both species ecological processes, such as population viability, and its evolutionary processes, like gene flow and local adaptation. Yet obtaining accurate estimates in the wild through direct observation can be challenging or even impossible, particularly over large spatial and temporal scales. Genotyping many individuals from wild populations can provide detailed inferences about dispersal. We therefore utilized genomewide marker data to estimate dispersal in the classic metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.), in the Aland Islands in SW Finland. This is an ideal system to test the effectiveness of this approach due to the wealth of information already available covering dispersal across small spatial and temporal scales, but lack of information at larger spatial and temporal scales. We sampled three larvae per larval family group from 3732 groups over a six-year period and genotyped for 272 SNPs across the genome. We used this empirical data set to reconstruct cases where full-sibs were detected in different local populations to infer female effective dispersal distance, that is, dispersal events directly contributing to gene flow. On average this was one kilometre, closely matching previous dispersal estimates made using direct observation. To evaluate our power to detect full-sib families, we performed forward simulations using an individual-based model constructed and parameterized for the Glanville fritillary metapopulation. Using these simulations, 100% of predicted full-sibs were correct and over 98% of all true full-sib pairs were detected. We therefore demonstrate that even in a highly dynamic system with a relatively small number of markers, we can accurately reconstruct full-sib families and for the first time make inferences on female effective dispersal. This highlights the utility of this approach in systems where it has previously been impossible to obtain accurate estimates of dispersal over both ecological and evolutionary scales.

AB  - Describing and understanding the relationship between streamflow and ecological processes is a classic problem in stream ecology and river management. We applied the individual-based model inSTREAM to describe the relationship between the dynamic river habitat and emergent population responses in sympatric landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and lake-migrating brown trout (Salmo trutta). This application explicitly describes the environmental conditions in the Gullspang Rapids, a residual flow stretch in the hydropower-regulated Gullspang River, Sweden (Svenskt elfiskeregister - SERS, 2019) etween September 2008 and September 2018. We simulated three static minimum flow scenarios and three variable natural flow regimes, contrasting highly artificial conditions with more natural dynamics. Our main response variable was the number of large (>= 12 cm) out-migrants of salmon and trout, a proxy for successful population recruitment. The baseline model predicted an average production of 455 salmon and 532 trout out-migrants per year during 2008-2018 in this 11,700 m(2) spawning and rearing area. The only alternative scenario producing more out-migrants was when the minimum flow was raised by a factor of three, as this led to a modest increase in trout out-migrants. Interestingly, none of the flow alternatives produced more salmon out-migrants than the baseline model, suggesting a competitive disadvantage originating from spawning later than trout. Density-dependent population regulation, a well-known phenomenon in salmonids, was reproduced by the model. Both intra- and interspecific competition was evident. While the number of out-migrants varied with flow regime, sensitivity analyses showed that other model input, specifically velocity shelter availability and stream temperature, were just as important. Increased availability of velocity shelters (in-stream structures that reduces the swimming speed of drift-feeding fish) was the only environmental factor that increased production of both salmon and trout in silico. We conclude that in this system, flow restoration based on simplistic flow scenarios will have limited effect, unless complemented by an increase of instream structural complexity.

AB  - Increasing land-use intensity is a main driver of biodiversity loss in farmland, but measuring proxies for land-use intensity across entire landscapes is challenging. Here, we develop a novel method for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing parameters derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. We link crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from time-series of a two-band enhanced vegetation index with biodiversity indicators (insect pollinators and insect-pollinated vascular plants) in agricultural fields in southern Sweden, with contrasting land management (i.e. conventional and organic farming). Our results show that arable land-use intensity in cereal systems dominated by spring-sown cereals can be approximated using Sentinel-2 productivity parameters. This was shown by the significant positive correlations between the amplitude and maximum value of the enhanced vegetation index on one side and farmer reported yields on the other. We also found that conventional cereal fields had 17% higher maximum and 13% higher amplitude of their enhanced vegetation index than organic fields. Sentinel-2 derived parameters were more strongly correlated with the abundance and species richness of bumblebees and the richness of vascular plants than the abundance and species richness of butterflies. The relationships we found between biodiversity and crop production proxies are consistent with predictions that increasing agricultural land-use intensity decreases field biodiversity. The newly developed method based on crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from Sentinel-2 data serves as a proof of concept for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity over cereal fields across larger areas. It enables the estimation of arable productivity in cereal systems, which can then be used by ecologists and develop tools for land managers as a proxy for land-use intensity. Coupled with spatially explicit databases on agricultural land-use, this method will enable crop-specific cereal productivity estimation across large geographical regions.

AB  - Breeding companies need protection for genetic material to assure revenues from genetic improvement and investment. Fish farmers and fish breeders need access to genetic resources for food production and further development and sustainable use of fish genetic material. In Norway, access legislation is now in the process of being developed. The objective of this paper is to discuss some of the main challenges associated with access to and protection of fish genetic resources in aquaculture. In an interdisciplinary study, we combine expertise on fish breeding and genetic resources with that on law and political science regarding regimes for resource management. Our material is drawn from a number of interviews with individuals directly involved in fish breeding and farming. Our most significant finding is that there is a discrepancy between the knowledge of farmers and breeders with respect to access and legal rights to genetic resources and the actual possibilities and limits offered by today's and forthcoming legislation. In order to maximize the industry's potential, there seems to be a need for information about access and legal rights to genetic resources. Market consolidations and privatisation are among the factors that are recognised as most important in changing the ground rules within the sector. Although the similar history of the plant and agricultural sector does not seem to have a high visibility among fish farmers and breeders, most are becoming more concerned with the questions of access to and protection of the wild and improved breeding material that is central to their trade. This realisation is predominantly linked to external use of Norwegian salmon genetic resources, as most breeders are still confident in the superiority of their own breeding populations. Nevertheless, the breeders also acknowledge their vulnerability, should access to new and improved materials or traits become severely restricted. The predominant view among our respondents is that the sector needs to find a balance between access to breeding material and protection of proprietary innovations in fish breeding. Coupled with this view is an emerging realisation that the value of improved breeding material invariably is underestimated, leaving the farmers to reap most of the added value from fish breeding and farming. Against this background, an interest in finding some way of capturing the value of the improved stocks is emerging among the fish breeders. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herbivory is one of the most important biotic disturbance types globally and is important for community structure and composition through species filtering. In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we address the relevance of recreational foraging, picking berries and mushrooms, for developing connection to nature and what happens when that practice is interrupted by drastic landscape change. We use the site of the largest forest fire in modern Swedish history as a case to examining the relevance of foraging. In previous studies, positive associations have been observed between the activity of picking berries and mushrooms with landscape-identity prior to forest fires. The results suggest that the more participants enjoyed foraging, the stronger their attachment to the landscape as well as memories and reasoning about the landscape. These relationships remainedafter the area has been drastically altered by fire, implying a significant role of foraging for keeping ; the positive feelings and memories of the forest landscape. Through questionnaires and semistructured interviews, we examine why individuals forage, what foraging meant for them before the event and how they relate to the landscape and foraging after the fire. Our findings suggest that these connections are built on an interplay between place, practice and intimate knowledge. We conclude that foraging play an essential role in defining and developing connections to landscape which can act as the basis for stewardship of the landscape. Management implications:
   In order to facilitate reconnection to the landscape after a forest fire there is a need to understand how individuals and communities related to the landscape before the fire. Foraging will always be reliant on issues of access, and specific management regimes. Cultural values and small-scale activities play an essential role in defining and developing connections to landscape. Connections which can ultimately inform a sense of responsibility and stewardship. Activities such as foraging are reliant on more than just the affordance provided by the physical and visual character of a landscape.

The objective was to determine the main characteristics of the spontaneous development of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest stands in relation to their naturalness, ecological stability and adaptation to climate change and air pollution stress.
   Horizontal and vertical structure and species diversity of the tree layer, dead wood and natural regeneration of each permanent research plot (PRP) were evaluated (n = 6, 50 x 50 m /0.25 ha/, Northern Bohemia, 410-425 m above sea level). The average ring series of PRPs were correlated with the climatic data (precipitation, temperature) according to individual years from the Doksy climatic station, and the air pollution data (SO, in 1988-2015, NOx and AOT4OF - ozone exposure in 1992-2015) from Radimovicc station.
   In 2016, the stand volume increased by 26.0% to 136 m(3) ha(-1) (108 m(3) ha(-1) in 2006) and the volume of dead wood increase by 127.2% to 27 m(3) ha(-1) (12 m(3) ha(-1) in 2006). The horizontal structure of tree layer and natural regeneration was predominantly aggregated to random. More distinct changes in biodiversity and structural characteristics occurred in the natural regeneration (21.5%) compared to tree layer (2.8%). The precipitation had a significantly higher effect on radial growth compared to temperature. The lack of precipitation in growing season and high temperature in previous autumn and winter were limiting factors for growth. Climatic factors had significant effect on diameter increment in July of the current year (P < 0.01) and June of the current and previous year (P < 0.05). Radial growth was negatively correlated with SO2 concentrations (P < 0.01) and ozone exposure (P < 0.05). NOx concentrations had low effect on radial growth. The natural stand dynamics had positive effect on biodivcrsity and functional integrity of natural pine eco-systems.

AB  - Biodiversity surveys of aquatic macroinvertebrates in standing water rely on various methods, but a thorough comparison of the techniques is lacking. This hampers analyses across surveys and impedes development of efficient sampling schemes. We compare the selectivity and efficiency of four methods commonly used to collect aquatic insects - activity traps (ATs), box trap (BT), handnetting (HN) and light trap (LT) - using a large dataset on water beetles in a site with similar to 100 species. We propose to use time investment as a natural basis to compare efficiency, since it applies to any method. The results inherently differ from results based on samples or individuals because methods are neither equally demanding nor equally rewarding. Most differences between methods arise from their size selectivity: ATs select for larger species, while HN and BT seem least selective. Attraction to light is taxon-specific and LT yields more depauperate samples than ATs, BT and HN, limiting the use of LT in community studies. To boost the development of cost-effective protocols, we also identify the best designs for rapid bioassesment by simulating short surveys from the data. Combinations of ATs and BT give most species; the results are robust to partitioning of effort between both methods. However, these rapid surveys miss on average more than 40% of all species in our study. Our results therefore emphasize that long-term studies using multiple methods are vital for measuring diversity in species-rich freshwater habitats. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Old-growth forest birds in Fennoscandia have sharply declined in numbers during the last decades apparently due to commercial forest harvesting and fragmentation of old-growth forests. Conservation measures have led to the establishment of a forest reserve network to assure the persistence of forest birds at a regional scale. However, little is known about the effects of landscape structure within and around the reserves on the distribution of old-growth forest birds. We used a hierarchical approach to address the questions of how landscape structure and composition within forest reserves, landscape composition of surrounding areas and reserve location affect the abundance of resident, old-growth forest birds in the Northern Finnish forest reserve network. The positive role of particular landscape features on bird distribution indicates that both the proportion of old-growth forests and the structure of boreal landscape mosaic has an important role in determining the distribution of these birds. The landscape composition surrounding the reserves proved to be only a weak predictor in species distribution models, which argues against the primary role of the surrounding matrix in determining species distribution within forest reserves. Reserves located near the Russian border showed a higher abundance of old-growth birds than more western ones. Once east-west gradients in overall landscape composition had been accounted for, however, reserves did not differ significantly in the number of species present. These results suggest that landscape gradients, rather than ecological processes such as the presence of source areas located along the border with Russia, are the main determinant of the distribution of old-growth forest birds in the Finnish reserve network. We propose that to enhance regional persistence of old-growth forest birds, conservation efforts should be primarily directed towards the protection and enhancement of forest habitat quality and natural heterogeneity of landscapes within targeted areas.

AB  - As most ecosystems, peatlands have been heavily exploited for different human purposes. For example, in Finland the majority is under forestry, agriculture or peat mining use. Peatlands play an important role in carbon storage, water cycle, and are a unique habitat for rare organisms. Such properties highlight their environmental importance and the need for their restoration. To monitor the success of peatland restoration sensitive indicators are needed. Here we test whether testate amoebae can be used as a reliable bioindicator for assessing peatland condition. To qualify as reliable indicators, responses in testate amoebae community structure to ecological changes must be stronger than random spatial and temporal variation. In this study, we simultaneously assessed differences between the effects of seasonality, intermediate scale spatial variation and land uses on living testate amoebae assemblages in natural, forested and restored peatlands. We expected the effects of seasonality on testate amoebae communities to be less pronounced than those of land use and within site variation. On average, natural sites harboured the highest richness and density, while the lowest numbers were found at forestry sites. Despite small changes observed in taxa dominance and differences in TA community structure between seasons and years at some sites, spatial heterogeneity, temperature, pH, nor water table depth seemed to significantly affect testate amoebae communities. Instead, observed differences were related to type of land use, which explained 75% of the community variation. Our results showed that testate amoebae community monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate impacts of human land use on boreal peatlands.

AB  - The boreal landscape stores an estimated 40% of the earth's carbon (C) found in terrestrial vegetation and soils, with a large portion collected in thick organic soil layers. These ground stores are subject to substantial removals due to the centurial return of wildfire, which has strong impacts on the soil microbial community and nutrient cycling, which in turn can control ecosystem recovery patterns and process rates, such as C turnover. Currently, predictive knowledge used in assessing fire impacts is largely focused on ecosystems that experience only superficial burning and few robust observations exist regarding the effect that smoldering combustion in deeper active soil layers has on post-fire soil activity. This study provided a highly replicated and regionally extensive survey of wildfire impact on microbial community structure (using fatty acid biomarkers) and nutrient cycling (using in situ ionic resin capsules) across broad gradients of climate, forest properties and fire conditions within 50 separate burn scars and 50 additional matched unburnt boreal forest soils. The results suggest a strong metabolic shift in burnt soils due to heat impact on their structure and a decoupling from aboveground processes, releasing ecosystem N limitation and increasing mobilization of N, P, K, and S as excess in conjunction with an altered, C-starved microbial community structure and reduced root uptake due to vegetation mortality. An additional observed climatic control over burnt soil properties has implications for altered boreal forest function in future climate and fire regimes deserving of further attention.

AB  - Tree species differences in crown size and shape are often highlighted as key characteristics determining light interception strategies and successional dynamics. The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics. Species crown size varies depending on site characteristics and other factors at the individual level which differ from competition for light and space. These factors, such as individual genetic characteristics, past disturbances or environmental micro-site effects, combine with competition-related phenotypic plasticity to determine the individual variability in crown size. Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes. In the present study, we structured and quantified variability at the species, site, and individual levels for three frequently used tree allometric relations using fixed and random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We focused on two species: Abies alba (silver fir) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) in nine forest stands of the western Alps. We demonstrated that species had different allometric relations from site to site and that individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations. Using a spatially explicit radiation transmission model on real stands, we showed that individual variability in tree allometry had a substantial impact on light resource allocation in the forest. Individual variability in tree allometry modulates species' light-intercepting ability. It generates heterogeneous light conditions under the canopy, with high light micro-habitats that may promote the regeneration of light-demanding species and slow down successional dynamics.

T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA  - English
KW  - DEPOSITION
AB  - This study provides an assessment on the spatial variability of the long-term leaching (8-23 years) of nitrogen and organic carbon from 22 forested catchments (0.69-56 km(2)). The catchments are located throughout Finland excluding the northernmost regions. The Kruunuoja catchment is located in a national park; the other catchments represent typical Finnish forestry land. The leaching from the 21 forestry land catchments can be considered to represent average leaching from Finnish forestry land since the most important forestry practices (ditching, clear-cutting, scarification, and fertilization) since the 1960s have affected about 2.4% of the catchment area per year (compare 2.5% in the entire country in 1980 and 2% in 1991). Moreover, the mean annual runoff from the catchments, 230-420 mm yr(-1), agree with the mean annual runoff from Finland (301 mm yr(-1) from 1931 to 1990). The major part of the nitrogen transported from the catchments consisted of organic nitrogen (on average 79%). The average inorganic nitrogen proportion ((NO3-N + NH4-N)/N-tot) was lowest (7.3%) in the Kruunuoja catchment and was highest (54%) in the southernmost Teeressuonoja catchment located in the highest anthropogenic nitrogen deposition area. The median C/N ratio in the study streams was high, ranging from 34 to 66. Nitrate leaching from the catchments varied between 2.8 (Kruunuoja) and 100 kg km(-2) yr(-1) (Teeressuonoja) and was negatively related to C/N ratio in stream water and latitude. The stepwise multiple regression model selected C/N ratio and nitrogen deposition which together explained 72% of the variation in NO3-N leaching. Retention of NO3-N deposition (calculated as ((input-output)/input) was high in all catchments, ranging from 0.99 in Kruunuoja to 0.67 in Teeressuonoja.

AB  - Forest biomass and its change over time have been measured at both local and large scales, an example for the latter being forest greenhouse gas inventories. Currently used methodologies to obtain stock change estimates for large forest areas are mostly based on forest inventory information as well as various factors, referred to as biomass factors, or biomass equations, which transform diameter, height or volume data into biomass estimates. However, while forest inventories usually apply statistically sound sampling and can provide representative estimates for large forest areas, the biomass factors or equations used are, in most cases, not representative, because they are based on local studies. Moreover, their application is controversial due to the inconsistent or inappropriate use of definitions involved. There is no standardized terminology of the various factors, and the use of terms and definitions is often confusing. The present contribution aims at systematically summarizing the main types of biomass factors (BF) and biomass equations (BE) and providing guidance on how to proceed when selecting, developing and applying proper factors or equations to be used in forest biomass estimation. The contribution builds on the guidance given by the IPCC (Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry, 2003) and suggests that proper application and reporting of biomass factors and equations and transparent and consistent reporting of forest carbon inventories are needed in both scientific literature and the greenhouse gas inventory reports of countries.

AB  - A significant barrier to the assessment of ecosystem services is a lack of primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.

AB  - Understanding and communicating the links among human activities and marine ecosystem services are fundamental for ecosystem-based management, which aims at attaining ecological, economic and social sustainability in the use of our seas. Relationships are typically complex and may differ between geographic areas. Here, an assessment model that combines available quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative information, rooted in the DAPSIR (Driver-Activity-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework and assessment requirements of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, is developed and applied. Focusing on Swedish marine waters, major human activities at sea are evaluated in relation to their dependencies and impacts on the status of marine ecosystem services. This case study is a consensus assessment based on evaluation of available literature and data. By relating degrees of dependencies and impacts to values of different economic sectors, discrepancies among sectors with respect to their impact versus their monetary value can be identified. In our case, commercial fishing depends on and influences a wide range of ecosystem services, while other sectors, such as shipping, depend little on marine ecosystem services. At the extreme end of the range, pressures from human activities in the past, such as historical nutrient emissions, still have prominent influence on ecosystem services today, entailing considerable losses. Marine tourism and commercial fishing show similar dependencies on ecosystem services, but tourism has a clearly lower impact on ecosystem services and a higher monetary value. The model may serve as a useful tool for communicating and guiding priorities in integrated environmental management and maritime spatial planning.

AB  - Riparian habitats of boreal forests are considered as hotspots for biochemical processes and biodiversity, and varying width riparian buffers have been proposed to protect species diversity of the riparian forests. However, evidence of the role of soil moisture variation in shaping riparian biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain scarce particularly regarding belowground diversity. We studied how distance from the stream and soil moisture of the riparian zone affected species richness and community composition of plants, bacteria, and fungi as well as microbial decomposition rates. Using a split-plot design with a plant survey and amplicon sequencing for microorganisms we identified taxa associated with different categories of moisture and distance from the stream along six headwater stream-sides in middle boreal forests in Northern Finland. Tea-bag Index was used to assess the decomposition rates. PERMANOVA and linear mixed-effect models were used to analyze the data. Variation in riparian soil moisture influenced species composition and richness of plants and bacteria. Plant communities also changed from herbaceous dominated to shrub dominated with increasing distance from the stream. Fungal communities, however, did not respond to soil moisture or distance from the stream, and there were only slight differences in fungal trophic guilds among moisture and distance categories. Decomposition of organic material by microorganisms was faster adjacent to the stream than further away, and moist riparian areas had higher decomposition rates than drier ones. Decomposition rates were positively related to pH, Ca, Mg and NH4 and soil temperature. Synthesis and applications We show that above-and belowground diversity and microbial decomposition are associated to soil moisture at riparian sites supporting the idea of leaving wider unmanaged buffers in moist habitats to safeguard the overall forest diversity. Our findings further emphasize the need to consider soil moisture when planning the measures for riparian protection as changes in riparian soil moisture could lead to deterioration of organic matter decomposition. Different responses of the examined plant and microbial communities to riparian soil conditions clearly imply that overall riparian diversity cannot be explained based on a single community type, and that different organisms may respond differently to human-induced changes in stream riparian zone.

AB  - Background
   Fungi are heterotrophic, unicellular or filamentous organisms that exhibit a wide range of different lifestyles as, e.g., symbionts, parasites, and saprotrophs. Mycologists have traditionally considered fungi to be a nearly exclusively terrestrial group of organisms, but it is now known that fungi have a significant presence in aquatic environments as well. We know little about most fungi in limnic and marine systems, including aspects of their taxonomy, ecology, and geographic distribution. The present study seeks to improve our knowledge of fungi in the marine environment. The fungal communities of two coastal marine environments of the Kattegat sea, Sweden, were explored with metabarcoding techniques using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcode. Our data add new information to the current picture of fungal community composition in benthic and coastal habitats in Northern Europe.
   New information
   The dataset describes the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their taxonomic affiliations in two littoral gradients sampled on the Swedish west coast, Gothenburg municipality. Our data include basic diversity indices as well as chemical and edaphic sediment/soil parameters of the sampling sites. From the sites, 3470 and 4315 fungal OTUs, respectively, were recovered. The number of reads were 673,711 and 779,899, respectively, after quality filtering. Within the benthic sites, more than 80% of the sequences could not be classified taxonomically. The phylum composition of the classifiable sequences was dominated in both localities by Dikarya, which made up around 33% of the OTUs. Within Dikarya, Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Guild assignment failed for more than half of the classifiable OTUs, with undefined saprotrophs being the most common resolved guild. This guild classification was slightly more common in the ocean sediment samples than in the terrestrial ones. Our metadata indicated that ocean sites contain organisms at a lower trophic level and that there are predominantly endophytic, parasitic, and pathogenic fungi in the marine environments. This hints at the presence of interesting and currently poorly understood fungus-driven ecological processes. It is also clear from our results that a very large number of marine fungi are in urgent need of taxonomic study and formal description.

AB  - A compendium of agricultural countermeasures and rural waste disposal options has been compiled as part of the EC STRATEGY (Sustainable Restoration and Long-Term Management of Contaminated Rural, Urban and Industrial Ecosystems) project. The compendium was discussed by the FARMING (Food and Agriculture Restoration Management Involving Networked Groups) network of stakeholders during meetings of national panels in the UK, Finland, Belgium, Greece and France in 2002. Their preliminary feedback has been summarised in terms of whether an option is generally acceptable, unacceptable or only acceptable under specific circumstances. A considerable divergence of opinion between national panels was apparent for many of the options considered. This could be attributed to differences in geomorphology, climate, land management, infrastructure, consumer confidence, sociopolitical context and culture. Where consensus was reached between stakeholders it was generally for those countermeasures that provide public reassurance, sustain farming practices and minimise environmental impact. Furthermore, whilst there was general agreement that contaminated food should not enter the food chain, many of the options proposed for its subsequent management were not generally acceptable to stakeholders.

AB  - The challenge to the sustainable development of forestry in the Eurasian temperate - boreal zone is the increase in the frequency and severity of natural disturbances due to global climate change. In this study, a mathematical model for predicting the risk of wildfires in spruce stands growing in the territory of Slovak Paradise National Park under climate change has been proposed and tested. Wildfire risk is described in terms of the observed probabilities of the destruction of spruce stands in relation to their age for a period of 10 years. As the indicators of assumed climate change, the time series of daily values of four fire weather indices (Angstrom, Nesterov, Baumgartner, and the Meteorological Forest Fire Risk Index) for the period 1951-2019 have been analysed. The results obtained indicated the significant dependence of the observed increasing annual population proportions of burnt areas on the gradually increasing annual population proportions of risky days recorded and evaluated by using the common scales of risk classification. We found that ongoing climate change has a significant impact on increasing the risk of fires. The Meteorological Forest Fire Risk Index has proven to be the most suitable measure for predicting the probability of fire occurrence under the climate conditions in the experimental territory. The indicated risk of fire occurrence in spruce stands under the assumption of a climatic change is substantially higher than in the case when this assumption is neglected. This information can also serve as a basis for the formulation of efficient landscape fire protection measures focused on building the infrastructure to support the efficient retardation of propagation, including the quick suppression of this detrimental natural hazard.

AB  - The objective of this study was to define the value of the main market and nonmarket functions of fjord and mountain agroecosystems in Nordic countries by means of the ecosystem services framework. First, we used qualitative methods (interviews of farmers and other stakeholders in the area of study) to identify sociocultural perceptions of multifunctional agriculture. Next, we used survey-based stated-preference methods to rank and value in economic terms the most important functions (corresponding to the four types of ecosystem services) according to the local (residents of the study area) and the general (residents of a nearby area) populations. The sociocultural perceptions of multifunctionality among local stakeholders were similar, but differences in the relative importance of the functions reflected particular interests (agriculture compared with tourism). Both the local and the general populations attached great importance to the production and availability of quality foods. The general population showed very homogeneous preferences among ecosystem services, but local people rated them very differently. Local people ranked a more agricultural landscape very high. The total economic value of fjord and mountain agroecosystem was 850 per person per year. The willingness to pay for the provision of ecosystem services under a policy scenario of further development of multifunctional agriculture clearly exceeded the current level of public support. The welfare loss that society would experience in a scenario of further abandonment of agriculture was even greater. We discuss the establishment of payments for ecosystem services for addressing the undersupply of nonmarket functions of agriculture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herbivores are known to decrease plant species diversity in ecosystems with low productivity. Limestone pavements are low-productive habitats harboring specialized communities of cyanobacteria, and endo- and epilithic lichens exposed to extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations. Pavements of the Great Alvar (Oland, Sweden) are covered by free-living cyanobacteria giving the rock surface a dark color. Based on cyanobacterial abundance along the edges, two types of cracks intersecting the pavements have been described: Type one with abundant cyanobacteria and type two without cyanobacteria resulting in light-colored edges. Erosion and different lengths of inundation by melt water have been suggested to cause the conspicuous differences in community composition and hence color between cracks. We hypothesized that this pattern results from the grazing activity of the cyanobacteria- and lichen-feeding snail Chondrina clienta, which reduces cyanobacterial cover along light-colored cracks and facilitates endolithic lichens. Three dark and three light-colored cracks were investigated at each of three localities. Crack characteristics (i.e., aspect, width, depth and erosion) and snail density were assessed at the crack level. Cyanobacterial cover and lichen diversity were recorded in 1-cm sections, sampled every 5 cm along eight 160-cm-long transects per crack. Model selection was applied to estimate effects of snail density and distance from crack edges on cyanobacterial abundance and lichen diversity. Crack characteristics explained no differences in cyanobacterial cover or lichen diversity. However, cyanobacterial cover decreased towards the edges of cracks with high snail densities. A transplant experiment supported the correlational evidence. The abundant cyanobacterial cover on pieces of stone placed close to cracks with high snail densities was completely grazed within 19 months. By contrast, cyanobacteria recolonized initially completely grazed pieces of stone when fixed near cracks without snails. Abundance and diversity of endolithic lichens increased along cracks with high compared to low snail densities but decreased in epilithic lichens and lichens with cyanobacterial symbionts. However, the presence of the gastropod herbivore decreased overall lichen diversity. Comparing presence-absence matrices with null models revealed that species co-occurred less frequently than expected. Taken together, we provide evidence that herbivory indirectly released endolithic lichens from competition for light by reducing cyanobacterial cover.

AB  - A study of population connectivity of the migratory insect species, such as dronefly Eristalis tenax (Diptera, Syrphidae), has an essential importance in understanding the relative influence of the evolutionary forces and environmental features that interact in the spatial distribution of molecular and morphological diversity. However, specific study aiming to understand spatial genetic structure of dronefly populations and its migratory potential is lacking. Hence, we studied a spatial pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation of seven European populations of E. tenax incorporating landscape genetic methods using allozyme data, wing size and shape and abdominal colour pattern. Based on the observed lack of genotypic structuring, we suggested that there has been sufficient long-distance gene flow to effectively homogenize population structuring at a broader geographical scale. Wing shape similarity among populations and an overlap of abdominal colour variation showed no clear clustering related to geography, which is in congruence with genetic data. However, genetic (F-ST values) and phenotypic (wing size) data and landscape genetics indicated subdivision between the Balkan populations (four Serbian samples) and populations from Central (Germany and Switzerland) and Northern (Finland) Europe. These findings indicated a potential connection between the Central and Northern Europe supporting the Central European origin of the flies caught in Finland. Thus, by performing spatial analysis and combining genetic-morphological approach, we shed light on the movement pattern in complex landscapes and thus provided the necessary guidelines to a broad-scale analysis of this widespread generalist pollinator.

AB  - Hydroid diversity and species composition were studied in Arctic coastal waters around the Norwegian Svalbard Archipelago. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of physical factors (depth and substrate type) on the distribution and diversity of the benthic hydrozoan fauna that has been poorly studied in the high-latitude polar region. The study is based on a total of 557 samples collected between 1996 and 2007. Over 1200 colonies and 70 taxa of Hydrozoa were collected by SCUBA divers, dredges and van Veen grabs. The distribution patterns with respect to major environmental factors were studied based on presence/absence data. Four substrate types were most commonly colonized by hydroid colonies: algae, bryozoans, rocks and hydrozoans. The highest species richness was noted on algae and rocks. Shallow water communities of the study area were characterized by a high hydroid species richness. A number of species decrease along the depth gradient. Some species have shown some preferences towards selected substrates or one of the two depth zones, but most hydroid species were generalists in terms of both the depth and substrate preferences. No species could be classified as substrate-specific (i.e. occurring only on one substrate type). The substrate heterogeneity was shown to be an important driver of hydroid species richness in Arctic coastal waters.

AB  - The conifer tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are important elements in tree species composition and forest management of Central European forests, but their potential to thrive under anticipated climatic changes is still debated controversially. This study contributes a multivariate analysis of resilience components based on increment cores sampled at breast height of Norway spruce, silver fir and Douglas fir trees growing along elevational gradients in Southwestern Germany. We aimed to gain novel insights into the species-specific and elevational response of tree growth and wood density variables during the extreme drought events of the years 2003 and 2018. Our results for Norway spruce corroborate projections of its ongoing decline during climate change as the reductions of wood density and biomass production indicated high drought sensitivity at all elevations. Moreover, resilience indices of mean tree-ring density, maximum latewood density, tree-ring width and biomass production were even lower after the drought of 2018 compared to the previous drought of 2003. Silver fir, a potential substitute tree species for Norway spruce, showed unexpected results with resistance and resilience indices being significantly lower in 2018 compared to 2003 indicating that silver fir might be more vulnerable to drought than previously expected, especially at low elevations. In contrast, the superior growth rates and higher levels of drought tolerance of Douglas fir were especially pronounced during the drought of 2018 and visible across the entire elevational gradient, even though high coning intensity was present for all investigated tree species as a possible confounding factor to exacerbate the drought stress effects in the study region.

AB  - Driftwood is woody debris that is floating on the sea or brought onto the shore by the sea. It can have a natural origin but often it originates from human activities. Driftwood has a significant ecological role as a microhabitat for a large range of species. Dead-wood-associated aphyllophoroid fungi on driftwood have been studied rather little globally, and there are hardly any studies conducted in the Baltic Sea. We studied the diversity and ecology of polypores and corticioids growing on driftwood (man-made logs) on the shores of the Finnish SW-archipelago. In total, 394 driftwood logs were surveyed for visible fungal sporocarps. We found altogether 145 species (1023 records) of which approximately three-fourths were corticioids. The driftwood logs hosted several rare and noteworthy species, such as one new corticioid species, 16 nationally rare species, and 40 new species to the region. The five most common species accounted for one-third of all observations, whereas 82 species (11% of all records) were recorded only once or twice. Larger logs hosted, on average, more species compared to small-diameter logs. The mean number of species increased significantly when comparing the logs in the first and the middle stages of decay. Our results show that driftwood logs can host a wide variety of species and they provide an important substrate for many dead-wood-associated fungi, including species of conservation concern and species with restricted ecological requirements. Driftwood hosted several species that have not been previously found in the archipelago forests, and the logs clearly enrich the fungal diversity in the area. Our results encourage to increase dead wood for fungi in coastal forests where it has been dramatically decreased as a result of strong hemeroby.

AB  - Introduced species represent major threats to native and natural biodiversity. On the other hand, biologists may increase the understanding of ecological interactions by following communities during establishment of exotic species. Accordingly, feeding ecology and habitat use were studied in native whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and recently invading vendace (C. albula) in two lake localities situated 50 km apart within the subarctic Pasvik River system, northern Norway and Russia. Whitefish originally dominated the native fish communities of both lakes. The recent invasion and successive downstream expansion of vendace allowed comparisons between two sites: one in which the influence of the new potential competitor on the native fish species was weak, and one in which the influence was strong. In the downstream lake vendace was recorded for the first time at the time of the study, and only in small numbers, whereas in the upstream lake vendace had established a high population density and was the dominant fish species in the pelagic zone. No vertical segregation in pelagic habitat use was found between the two fish species in either lake. In the downstream lake both whitefish and vendace fed exclusively on zooplankton and had almost identical diets. In the upstream lake. in contrast, whitefish fed predominantly on zoobenthos and surface insects, while vendace fed mainly on zooplankton. Thus. the strong presence of vendace as a specialized planktivore reduced the availability of zooplankton as prey for the more generalist whitefish. The food segregation between the two fish species in the upstream lake was apparently interactive and caused by a strong asymmetrical competition for zooplankton, vendace being the superior species. The ecological consequences (including reduced zooplankton size and species diversity, alteration of the pelagic food web, and eutrofication as a possible cascading effect on the primary production) of the vendace invasion in the Pasvik watercourse are considerable, even after a few years. and are likely to proceed and intensify in the future.

AB  - Impact studies of chronic bottom trawling aiming to reveal long-term effects on benthic organisms are often hampered by the lack of comparable untrawled conditions and the difficulty in assessing the spatial distribution of trawling intensity. We sampled soft-seafloor macrofauna over a precise trawling gradient in the Kattegat using hourly vessel monitoring systems and logbooks. The gradient included the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), where trawling intensity declined sharply to zero. Our results show shifts in the macrofauna assemblage and non-linear responses, with decreases in the number and diversity of species at low to medium trawling intensities. The benthic community was dominated by burrowing brittle stars, of which one species, Amphiura chiajei, increased in abundance from low to medium trawling intensities. We interpret this positive response to increasing trawling intensities as a consequence of reduction in predation by benthivorous flatfish and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, which are significant catches of the fishery. The response was supported by a corresponding trend towards lower abundance of the dominating brittle stars following enforcement of the MPA and presumably an increase in benthivore density and predation pressure within the MPA. We conclude that chronic bottom trawling reduces diversity and may boost the abundances of species resistant to bottom trawling. The results emphasize the need to consider food web effects when assessing the impact of bottom trawling.

AB  - Question: The eu-atlantic forest herb Ceratocapnos claviculata showed a recent increase in frequency within its native range and an eastward and northward range expansion in Central Europe. To gain deeper understanding of factors affecting the range expansion of the species, we analyzed vegetation releves at three different scales and asked the following questions: As the species occurs in a wide range of vegetation types, is variation in community composition across the entire range related to climatic environmental zones and tree cover? Are there differences in species composition and habitat characteristics between the native range and the two invaded regions (S Sweden and NE Germany)? Did community composition and habitat characteristics within the native range (The Netherlands) change between 'before 1970' and '1990 to 2006'?
   Location: W, C and N Europe.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation-plot data with C. claviculata from various databases and own surveys using partial CCA, partial DCA, Indicator Species Analysis, MANCOVA and multiple regression.
   Results: Using vegetation plots from the entire distribution range, climatic environmental zones explained 68.9% of the total canonical Eigenvalue. Differences in floristic composition and habitat characteristics between the two invaded regions were as large as between native and invaded range sites. However, releves from the invaded range were generally characterized by anthropogenic disturbance. Accordingly, abundance of C. claviculata was positively linked to silvicultural intensity. New releves from 1990 to 2006 were characterized by higher Ellenberg nutrient indicator values, lower species diversity, higher proportions of neophytic and hemerobic species and showed a lower cover of the study species than old releves from before 1970.
   Conclusions: Across the range of C. claviculata, climatic environmental zones determine vegetation composition. Accordingly, the species is characterized by a broad macroclimatic amplitude. Vegetation composition and structure differ significantly between the two regions of the new range. Thus, the species has successfully established under various biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Beyond potential positive effects of soil eutrophication and mild winters, anthropogenic impact may directly facilitate seed dispersal and provide sites and resource conditions suitable for germination and establishment of C. claviculata, whereas a decrease of forest management may constrain the species.

AB  - The inherently unknown future development of a Nordic bio-economy was studied with four scenarios applied in an ecosystem service assessment framework. This framework couples CORINE land use cover with estimates of 15 final ecosystem services from the CICES 5.1 classification in biophysical and monetary terms. Current land use in two catchments, Lilleb AE k (83% cropland, area 4.7 km(2), Denmark) and Ovre Haldenvassdraget (67% forest, 1006 km(2), Norway) was compared with four scenarios for 2050. One scenario focusing on sustainability and environmental awareness led to considerable changes in land use and ecosystem service delivery (more diverse provisioning and higher value of regulating services, but not a higher total economic value), whereas the other three did not deviate markedly from the current scenario. Projected land use scenarios were verified with experts and stakeholder representatives. We conclude that the framework has sufficient resolution to show differences in service delivery among scenarios.

AB  - As the climate changes there is a need to reduce the reliance on Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) in upland British forestry and increase species diversity to lower the risk of damage or loss of production due to biotic or abiotic events. An analysis of relevant species trials was carried out to assess the productivity of potential alternative conifer species on upland site types in Britain. Data from 87 forest experiments planted between 1929 and 1995 were analysed to compare long-term performance of 52 species with that of Sitka spruce under the same conditions and site type. Sites were broadly categorized using soil and climatic factors, which were used as primary factors in models predicting General Yield Class (GYC, the maximum mean annual increment in m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) of the potential alternative species and of Sitka spruce. No species had significantly higher GYC estimates than Sitka spruce, but grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.), noble fir (Abies procera (Rehder)), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Lutz's spruce (Picea x lutzii (Little)), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster (Aiton)), Lawson cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray bis) Parl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata (Donn ex D.Don)) all had GYC estimates which were not significantly lower than that of Sitka spruce under certain soil and climate conditions. A further 26 species, particularly Abies species, had GYC within 3 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) of Sitka spruce but were present on too few sites for inclusion in statistical models. The results of the analysis provide objective evidence for the planting of a wider range of species where Sitka spruce may currently be first choice. In the absence of any major pest or disease affecting Sitka spruce, it is still a good choice for many upland sites, however, a wider range of options with equivalent productivity exist, allowing forest managers to diversify and reduce the risk of damage or loss of production due to biotic or abiotic events.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the effect of a diverse ownership structure with different management strategies within and between owner categories in long-term projections of economic, ecological and social forest sustainability indicators, representing important ecosystem services, for two contrasting Swedish municipalities. This was done by comparing two scenarios: one where the diversity of management strategies was accounted for (Diverse) and one where it was not (Simple). The Diverse scenario resulted in a 14% lower total harvested volume for the 100 year period compared to the Simple scenario, which resulted in a higher growing stock and a more favorable development of the ecological indicators. The higher proportion of sparse forests and the lower proportion of clear-felled sites made the Diverse scenario more appropriate for delivering access to common outdoor recreation activities, while the Simple scenario projected more job opportunities. Differences between the scenarios were considerable already in the medium term (after 20 years of simulation). Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the variety of management strategies employed by forest owners in medium- to long-term projections of the development of forest sustainability indicators.

AB  - Production forestry is known to reduce the naturally variable microhabitat pools in live trees and their biodiversity by tree removal and broad indirect effects of silviculture. However, the tree-scale processes are not known well enough for microhabitat management for the future. This study investigates how tree age affects the microhabitat occurrence in live trees, its effect modifiers, and explanatory value compared with tree diameter. We inventoried tree-related microhabitats on 879 live aspens (Populus tremula) and Norway spruces (Picea abies) of known age in 141 forests representing contrasting productive site conditions in Estonia. We analysed microhabitat incidence using logistic mixed models for significant tree-scale and stand-scale factors. Most microhabitat types appeared rare even in old trees, and the age effects had various patterns. Only 2% of trees bore five or more microhabitat types. Aspens and spruces had a similar microhabitat diversity before 80 years of age. Stand-level effects varied among microhabitat types but were less significant than tree-level effects; interactions were even rarer. Most effects found could be interpreted through known ecological processes; for example, humidity-dependent epiphytic growth; bark stripping by herbivores; pathogen effects in forests with distinct histories. In contrast, a reliable tree-scale prediction of microhabitat occurrence appears rarely possible; and depending on microhabitat type, either tree age or diameter can be a better predictor. We suggest that managing for tree-related microhabitats in production forests should combine facilitating ecological conditions for microhabitat formation, and early detection and retention of the trees with high microhabitat potential.

AB  - The population dynamics of a parasite depend on species traits, host dynamics and the environment. Those dynamics are reflected in the genetic structure of the population. Habitat fragmentation has a greater impact on parasites than on their hosts because resource distribution is increasingly fragmented for species at higher trophic levels. This could lead to either more or less genetic structure than the host, depending on the relative dispersal rates of species. We examined the spatial genetic structure of the parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola, and how it was influenced by dispersal, host population dynamics and habitat fragmentation. The host, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, lives as a metapopulation in a fragmented landscape in the Aland Islands, Finland. We collected wasps throughout the 50 by 70 km archipelago and determined the genetic diversity, spatial population structure and genetic differentiation using 14 neutral DNA microsatellite loci. We compared the genetic structure of the wasp with that of the host butterfly using published genetic data collected over the shared landscape. Using maternity assignment, we also identified full-siblings among the sampled parasitoids to estimate the dispersal range of individual females. We found that because the parasitoid is dispersive, it has low genetic structure, is not very sensitive to habitat fragmentation and has less spatial genetic structure than its butterfly host. The wasp is sensitive to regional rather than local host dynamics, and there is a geographic mosaic landscape for antagonistic co-evolution of host resistance and parasite virulence.

AB  - Severe changes in forest soil conditions, tree health and growth as well as plant species composition have been observed as a consequence of atmospheric acid deposition. The most important measure to counteract soil acidification is forest liming. The long-term effects of repeated liming on the bryophyte layer of forests, however, have rarely been analysed. We used a stratified design to sample the bryophyte layer of spruce stands located in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains, eastern Germany). Study sites were unlimed or limed at different intensities between one and five times since 1988. We found a significant effect of liming intensity on the composition and diversity of the bryophyte layer. The liming gradient is reflected by numerous indicator species, by indicator values for pH and nitrogen, and the by alpha and beta diversity of the species present. Liming strongly reduces the cover of many acidophytes typical for the habitat. By contrast, indicator species of disturbance and some rare, nutrient-demanding species appear to benefit from liming. These effects increase with liming intensity. Our results suggest that larger liming exclusion zones should be created to protect the typical bryophyte species composition.

AB  - Soil properties were compared in adjacent 50-year-old Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands growing on similar soils in south-west Sweden. The effects of tree species were most apparent in the humus layer and decreased with soil depth. At 20-30 cm depth in the mineral soil, species differences in soil properties were small and mostly not significant. Soil C, N, K. Ca, Mg, and Na content, pH, base saturation and fine root biomass all significantly differed between humus layers of different species. Since the climate, parent material, land use history and soil type were similar, the differences can be ascribed to tree species. Spruce stands had the largest amounts of carbon stored down to 30 cm depth in mineral soil (7.3 kg C m(-2)), whereas birch stands, with the lowest production, smallest amount of litterfall and lowest C:N ratio in litter and humus, had the smallest carbon pool (4.1 kg C m(-2)), with pine intermediate (4.9 kg C m(-2)). Similarly, soil nitrogen pools amounted to 349, 269, and 240 g N m(-2) for spruce, pine, and birch stands, respectively. The humus layer in birch stands was thin and mixed with mineral soil, and soil pH was highest in the birch stands. Spruce had the thickest humus layer with the lowest pH. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A meta-analysis using 77 studies from 28 countries was performed to assess the effect of hardwood vs. conifer overstory on soil organic C (SOC) storage in forest floor (FF), mineral soil, and whole soil (FF + mineral soil). Overall, FF stocks were 38% higher under conifers, mineral SOC stocks were similar, and whole soil SOC was 14% higher under conifers. An analysis with six of the seven most reported tree genera reaffirmed higher FF and whole soil C stocks under conifer stands. Analysis with all seven of the genera showed more pronounced variability in mineral SOC results compared with the overall results. Eucalyptus was the only hardwood that stored significantly (17%) more SOC in the mineral soil than adjacent conifers. Picea was the only conifer that stored significantly (7%) more SOC in the mineral soil than hardwoods. Differences in FF SOC stocks had a limited predictive power in explaining the variability of mineral SOC stock differences, suggesting that they are not very closely linked with regard to SOC storage. Only when comparing FF SOC stocks among genera did precipitation, age difference, soil texture, and previous land use moderate SOC storage differences between conifers and hardwoods. In other cases, neither climate nor soil variables could explain differences between SOC stocks. Our findings suggest that using plant-trait-driven vegetation categories may be a more descriptive way of detecting vegetation effects on SOC.

AB  - In the context of global change, a better understanding of the dynamics of wood degradation, and how they relate to tree attributes and climatic conditions, is necessary to improve broad-scale assessments of the contributions of deadwood to various ecological processes, and ultimately, for the development of adaptive post-disturbance management strategies. The objective of this meta-analysis was to review the effects of tree attributes and local climatic conditions on the time since death of coarse woody debris ranging in decomposition states. Results from our meta-analysis showed that projected warming will likely accelerate wood decomposition and significantly decrease the residence time in decay stages. By promoting such a decrease in residence time, further climate warming is very likely to alter the dynamics of deadwood, which in turn may affect saproxylic biodiversity by decreasing the temporal availability of specific habitats. Moreover, while coarse woody debris has been recognized as a key resource for bioenergy at the global scale, the acceleration of decay-stages transition dynamics indicates that the temporal window during which dead trees are available as feedstock for value-added products will shrink. Consequently, future planning and implementation of salvage harvesting will need to occur within a short period following disturbance, especially in warmer regions dominated by hardwood species. Another important contribution of this work was the development of a harmonized classification system that relies on the correspondence between the visual criteria used to characterize deadwood decomposition stages in locally developed systems the literature. This system could be used in future investigations to facilitate direct comparisons between studies. Our literature survey also highlights that most of the information on wood decay dynamics comes from temperate and boreal forests, whereas data from subtropical, equatorial and subarctic forests are scarce. Such data are urgently needed to allow broader-scale conclusions on global wood degradation dynamics.

AB  - A whole-farm model, HolosNorBeef was developed to estimate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from suckler beef production systems in Norway. The model considers direct emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from on-farm livestock production including soil carbon (C) changes, and indirect N2O and CO2 emissions associated with leaching, volatilization and inputs used on the farm. The emission intensities from average beef cattle farms in Norway was estimated by considering typical herds of British and Continental breeds located in two different regions, flatlands and mountains, with different resources and quality of feed available. The flatlands was located at a low altitude in an area suitable for grain production and mountains was located at higher altitude in a mountainous area not suitable for grain production. The estimated emission intensities were 29.5 and 32.0 kg CO2 equivalents (eq) kg(-1) carcass for the British breeds and 27.5 and 29.6 kg CO2 eq kg(-1) carcass for the Continental breeds, for flatlands and mountains, respectively. Enteric CH4 was the largest source accounting for 44-48% of total GHG emissions. Nitrous oxide from manure and soil was the second largest source accounting for, on average, 21% of the total emissions. Carbon sequestration reduced the emission intensities by 3% on average. When excluding soil C the difference between locations decreased in terms of GHG emission intensity, indicating that inclusion of soil C change is important when calculating emission intensities, especially when production of feed and use of pasture are included.

AB  - 1. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the European Union have set a target of restoring 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020 with the aim of conserving biodiversity and enhancing the supply of ecosystem services. This target must be implemented alongside other similar targets aimed at reducing the number of threatened habitat and species as assessed under the Birds and Habitats directives. However, there are several uncertainties associated with achieving these targets including the benefits of restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services, the contribution required from member states and the effect of different restoration scenarios on target achievement.
   2. In this study, we evaluate options that exist for meeting an EU-wide 15% restoration target while conserving habitats and species and enhancing ecosystem services. We explored the effects of different restoration scenarios on the percentage of threatened habitat and species secured. Lastly, we explored the effects of including financial cost into the prioritization procedure.
   3. Focusing restoration efforts on habitats with inadequate conservation status in the reporting of the Habitats Directive provides the largest benefit for species and ecosystem services. If the restoration target is set at 10% for habitat and species with inadequate or most threatened conservation status, and at 2% for all ecosystem services, about 18% of EU ecosystems should be restored to meet these targets.
   4. When the target is set at 15% of habitat and species and 3% of all ecosystem services, results showed that France hosts the highest percentage of identified priority areas (13%) followed by Spain and Finland with about 11% and Sweden with 9%. However, these numbers change when financial cost is included alongside other criteria, with France containing 35% of all areas identified.
   5. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that to achieve the greatest benefits, funding for restoration should be directed towards habitats with inadequate conservation status rather than to species. Countries with larger areas of threatened habitat and lower restoration costs may offer better opportunities to meet targets, but including cost at the EU level may result in unequal burden sharing among countries.

AB  - The uncertain effects of climatic change and changing demands for ecosystem services on the distribution of forests and their levels of service provision require assessments of future land-use change, ecosystem service provision, and how ecosystem service demands may be met. We present CRAFTY-Sweden, an agent-based, land-use model that incorporates land owner behaviour and decision-making in modelling future ecosystem service provision in the Swedish forestry sector. Future changes were simulated under scenarios of socioeconomic and climatic change between 2010 and 2100. The simulations indicate that the influence of climatic change (on land productivities) may be less important than that of socio-economic change or behavioural differences. Simulations further demonstrate that the variability in land owner and societal behaviour has a substantial role in determining the direction and impact of land-use change. The results indicate a sizeable increase in timber harvesting in coming decades, which together with a substantial decoupling between supply and demand for forest ecosystem services highlights the challenge of continuously meeting demands for ecosystem services over long periods of time. There is a clear need for model applications of this kind to better understand the variation in ecosystem service provision in the forestry sector, and other associated land-use changes.

AB  - Wild reindeer are under pressure from human development projects throughout their habitat. Norway is currently making a significant move to establish a new management model based on national reindeer regions and regional management plans. A focus on wild reindeer as a flagship species allows the species to be included as a broad conservation objective in complex land-use plans. The authors surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Rondane and Setesdal regions to examine their perceptions of the current status of reindeer and how management relates to other social and development issues. Local actors and institutions, including hunters, were perceived as more responsible and suited to make decisions about reindeer population sizes and management objectives than non-local actors. There was little local consensus on the role of human impacts on wild reindeer, and residents rated local knowledge higher than scientific knowledge for management purposes. Rondane residents attached more importance to reindeer than Setesdal residents, but the latter saw reindeer as more threatened by human development. New management approaches will need to take a social-ecological perspective and recognize that the inclusion of reindeer can enhance broader conservation goals at regional, national, and international levels, but may also escalate local social conflicts.

AB  - We analyzed hydrology, geology and benthic species composition to determine benthic habitat distribution patterns in a geologically complex area of the Gulf of Finland, Northern Baltic Sea. The analysis included several datasets describing coastal influence and geodiversity at multiple spatial scales. Geodiversity in this context refers to variation and/or patchiness of benthic substrates and seabed features. Multivariate statistical methods including BEST and LINKTREE routines were used to identify correlative relationships between different ecological variables. Environmental variables (e.g. water depth, Secchi depth, salinity) were either measured by sampling and remote sensing methods or parameterized from geographic and oceanographic data. Benthic assemblages were assayed by both video recordings and zoobenthic sampling (benthic grabs). Statistical analyses identified correlations between benthic datasets and environmental variables, but correlation parameters were not consistent especially with respect to differing zoobenthic and video-based estimates of benthic diversity. The ratio of Secchi depth to water depth showed strong correlation with species distributions observed in video recordings (rho = 0.56) whereas variables describing broad-scale geodiversity and archipelago gradient (the abundance of islands, ratio of land and sea area) correlated with zoobenthic sample data (generally rho > 0.30). A model that included independent variables of Secchi depth and terrain roughness within a 20 km radius explained the greatest proportion of spatial variation in zoobenthic sample data (rho = 0.69). Secchi depth and roughness values were positively correlated with species richness. We designated nine benthic marine landscapes on the basis of these two variables. Linkage tree statistical analysis (LINKTREE) routine utilized zoobenthic sample data as these offered better regional coverage and therefore effectively tracked relationships with other environmental variables. The benthic marine landscapes found in topographically complex seabed areas possessed higher species diversity than flatter areas with fewer seabed features. Our results indicate that on broad spatial scales, geodiversity and archipelago gradient directly influence benthic assemblages by providing a range of different habitats. These factors also indirectly influence benthic assemblages by channeling water movement and thereby distributing hydrologic conditions. This study demonstrates that broad-scale geodiversity should be considered in regional and mesoscale habitat mapping, maritime spatial planning and conservation policies.

AB  - Monitoring and understanding the spatio-temporal variations of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key basis to quantitatively assess the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem. To map and update forest AGB in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) of China, this work proposes a physical-based approach. Based on the baseline forest AGB from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images in 2008, we dynamically updated the annual forest AGB from 2009 to 2012 by adding the annual AGB increment (ABI) obtained from the simulated daily and annual net primary productivity (NPP) using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model. The 2012 result was validated by both field-and aerial laser scanning (ALS)-based AGBs. The predicted forest AGB for 2012 estimated from the process-based model can explain 31% (n = 35, p < 0.05, RMSE = 2.20 kg/m(2)) and 85% (n = 100, p < 0.01, RMSE = 1.71 kg/m(2)) of variation in field-and ALS-based forest AGBs, respectively. However, due to the saturation of optical remote sensing-based spectral signals and contribution of understory vegetation, the BEPS-based AGB tended to underestimate/overestimate the AGB for dense/sparse forests. Generally, our results showed that the remotely sensed forest AGB estimates could serve as the initial carbon pool to parameterize the process-based model for NPP simulation, and the combination of the baseline forest AGB and BEPS model could effectively update the spatiotemporal distribution of forest AGB.

AB  - 1. Metapopulation persistence and metacommunity diversity in patchy dynamic landscapes critically depend on efficient dispersal. Dispersal strategies could involve trade-offs that result in different species responses to habitat fragmentation, alteration in habitat quality and changes in landscape dynamics.
   2. We studied spatial structuring in species richness of obligate epiphytic bryophytes in 135 deciduous forest patches in a largely coniferous landscape in Sweden. We tested the effects of forest patch size (0.01-15 ha), patch quality and present and historic connectivity (as revealed by air photographs) on species richness of species groups with different mating systems, reproduction modes and diaspore sizes.
   3. Present connectivity to other deciduous forest patches had positive effects on richness of dioecious species with predominant asexual reproduction, whereas richness of monoecious species with predominant sexual reproduction was affected by historic connectivity only. The scale of spatial structuring in species richness increased with decreasing diaspore sizes. Forest patch quality affected richness of monoecious species reproducing sexually but not of dioecious species reproducing asexually.
   4. Our results suggest shorter dispersal distances, but higher establishment rates, of large asexual diaspores than of small sexual ones. In monoecious species with sexual reproduction, it may take several decades from establishment to first spore production, and this may explain the strong effect of historic, but not present, forest patch connectivity on species richness of this group. This suggests a trade-off between dispersal distance and age at first reproduction, which may explain the parallel evolution of asexual reproduction and monoecism in species inhabiting patchy, transient habitats.
   5. Synthesis. We conclude that dispersal success of metacommunity members is influenced both by species traits and habitat characteristics. In patch-tracking metacommunities, trade-offs in species traits may have evolved as a consequence of conflicting selection pressures imposed by habitat patchiness and dynamics. Syndromes of interrelated species traits imply that fairly small changes in habitat conditions may lead to distinct changes in metacommunity diversity: Species reproducing asexually may drastically decline with increasing distances among patches, whereas sexually reproducing species may decline with increasing patch dynamics.

AB  - Forest structure and diversity have generally been well studied, but the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on structural differences of hemi-boreal old-growth and managed mature stands have not been quantified along a wide range of the productivity gradient. This study compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest "naturalness". We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical range in Estonia.
   Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened.
   The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood, canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer vegetation.
   Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity, forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) history of forest management practices. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review paper provides an overview of approaches to which we may resort for handling the complex decision problems involving uncertainty and risk that climate change implies for forest managers. Modelling approaches that could support adaptive management strategies seem to be called for, not only as climate change denotes increased economic uncertainty but also because new and more reliable information becomes available as time passes and climate changes.
   The paper (1) provides a broad overview of state-of-the-art methods for optimal decision making under risk and uncertainty in forestry and (2) elaborates on the possible use of these methods in adaptive forest management under climate change.
   A survey of the current literature is carried out to identify approaches and developments that may prove most promising in relation to different challenges to the adaptive management of forest ecosystems under climate change.
   Most studies focusing on changing, typically increasing, risks in forest management under climate change tend to build on existing approaches about changes in risk levels contingent on climate change scenarios.
   Finally, we discuss what to emphasise in future studies to improve the understanding of adaptive forest management and decision support tools needed to cope with climate change.

AB  - Soil organic C (SOC) in agricultural soils is affected by cropping system. In order to compare the impact of ley-dominated and cereal monoculture rotations on soil properties, a series of experiments was started in Sweden in the early 1980s. This study quantified the effect of rotations and N fertilisation on SOC stocks and microbial community composition. After 35 years, soil samples taken down to 50-cmdepth at two sites with contrasting soil texture (clay and loam) were analysed for soil C and N, bulk density and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content. Significant increases in SOC concentrations and stocks were found in the ley-dominated rotation compared with the cereal monoculture rotation, the difference being 0.36 and 0.59 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) for sites with the clay and loam texture, respectively, in average over N fertiliser levels. Nitrogen fertilisation increased SOC stocks significantly in the cereal monoculture, but not in the ley-dominated rotation. In the loam, SOC responses in the subsoil were almost as high as those in the topsoil, but they were insignificant in the clay soil. These results indicate that soil texture and structure can have a great impact on the potential of subsoils to sequester C, which requires attention when scaling up SOC sequestration rates for regional or global assessments.

AB  - To balance trade-offs between livestock's negative environmental impacts and their positive contributions (e.g. maintaining semi-natural grasslands, varied agricultural landscapes and crop rotations), a better understanding is needed of how the supply of ecosystem services differs across farms. We analysed a suite of indicators for non-provisioning ecosystem services on a large subset of Swedish farms (71% of farms, covering 82% of agricultural land) and related these to farm type, farm size and livestock density. The analysed indicators exhibited clear geographical patterns with hotspots especially in less productive regions. Controlling for this spatial variation we still found that small-scale and ruminant farms were associated with more varied landscapes, small-scale habitats, semi-natural grasslands and better crop sequences compared to nearby farms specialised in crop production, while farms specialising in monogastric livestock were associated with less varied landscapes and inferior crop sequences. Results for cultural ecosystem services indicated that farms with more semi-natural grassland were associated with more visitors and more likely located within designated recreation or nature conservation areas.

AB  - This study carries out interregional comparisons of development and sustainable use of natural capital with and without inclusion of non-marketed ecosystem services. A simple dynamic model of an open economy shows that appropriate adjustment of conventional income accounts includes flow and stock components, but excludes explicit entrance of pollution. Calculations are made for Swedish regions and for two types of ecosystem services - pollution sequestration and recreational services - provided by three types of ecosystems: forests, agricultural landscape and wetlands. When comparing the adjusted and non-adjusted regional income accounts it is shown that the two measurements generate significantly different pictures of regional income and growth: regions that are traditionally considered as relatively less growth promoting are shown to hold important sources of wealth from natural capital, while counties that are rich in conventional accounts fall behind when adjusting for values of changes in natural capital.

AB  - The effects of silvicultural treatments on carbon sequestration are poorly understood, particularly in areas like the Mediterranean where soil fertility is low and climatic conditions can be harsh. In order to improve our understanding of these effects, a long-term thinning experiment in a stand of Mediterranean maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) was studied to identify the effects of thinning on soil carbon (forest floor and mineral soil), above and belowground biomass and fine and coarse woody debris. The study site was a 59-year-old pinewood, where three thinnings of differing intensities were applied: unthinned (control), moderate thinning and heavy thinning. The three thinning interventions (for the managed plots) involved whole-tree harvesting. The results revealed no differences between the different thinning treatments as regards the total soil carbon pool (forest floor + mineral soil). However, differences were detected in the case of living aboveground biomass and total dead wood debris between unthinned and thinned plots; the former containing larger amounts of carbon. The total carbon present in the unthinned plots was 317 Mg ha(-1); in the moderately thinned plots, it was 256 Mg ha(-1) and in the case of heavily thinned plots, 234 Mg ha(-1). Quantification of these carbon compartments can be used as an indicator of total carbon stocks under different forest management regimes and thus identify the most appropriate to mitigate the effects of global change. Our results indicated that thinning do not alter the total soil carbon content at medium term, suggesting the sustainability of these silvicultural treatments.

AB  - The Norway rat,Ratttus norvegicus, is a common agricultural pest and an important reservoir host of many zoonoses. A long-term field investigation on gamasid mites was made in 39 counties of Yunnan province, southwest China from 1990 to 2015. A total of 1448 Norway rats were captured, and 10,034 individuals of gamasid mites were collected from the body surface of the rats, which were identified as 42 species and 16 genera under 6 families. Based on some strategies of "data mining", the present paper took advantage of the long-term accumulated original data and made an ecological analysis of gamasid mites on the Norway rat. The results showed that the infestation of gamasid mites on 1448 Norway rats was common with an overall prevalence (48.55%), mean abundance (6.93) and mean intensity (14.27). Of 42 species of gamasid mites,Laelaps nuttalli,Laelaps echidninusandOrnithonyssus bacotiwere three dominant species, and they showed an aggregated distribution among different individuals of their rat host,R. norvegicus. There were much more species (39 species) of gamasid mites on the outdoor rats with a higher prevalence (65.12%), mean abundance (10.24) and mean intensity (15.72) than on the indoor rats (p < 0.001). The Norway rats in the lower altitude gradients showed a higher infestation prevalence and intensity of the mites, but lower species diversity. The adult rats had higher infestations (prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity) of the mites than the juvenile rats. Most gamasid mites showed a predominantly male-biased sex ratio on Norway rats. The association coefficient was used to analyze the interspecific relationship between any two dominant mite species, and a positive association was found betweenL. nuttalliandL. echidninus. The curve tendency of species-sample relationship showed that the numbers of mite species still kept increasing without an eventual "platform" stage when the sampled rats reached 1200 individuals, and this implies a great heterogeneity of the mite community on the rat. Preston's lognormal distribution model successfully fitted the theoretical curve of species abundance distribution of gamasid mites onR. norvegicus, which illustrated the distribution of the dominant, common and rare species of the mites.

AB  - Throughout the years, the forest sector (forest activities and forest industries) has received special attention concerning the quantification of its environmental performance. Douglas-fir is a softwood species with multiple industrial applications, high productivity and physiological adaptability. In Europe, Germany is the second most important country in terms of dedicated areas to the cultivation of this tree species. This study aims to assess the environmental impacts associated to Douglas-fir cultivation in Germany under representative management practices, including a detailed life cycle inventory of all the processes performed all over the life cycle of the plantation.
   The environmental assessment shows that the stand establishment and tending is the main responsible of the environmental impacts due to the constraints related to numerous thinning steps (thinning, roundwood forwarding and loading onto trucks for final distribution) which require the use of large machineries and fossil fuel. The logging stage, which includes the final cutting and the corresponding forwarding and loading into trucks, is the second most important stage with a remarkable contribution to all the environmental categories. Although these hot-spots have also been identified for other forest systems in the literature, the different management practices, system boundaries and intensity of forest systems (frequency of activities) will have a key role on the final environmental assessment. In relative terms, forest management activities performed all over the life cycle of Douglas-fir presents much lower environmental impact in comparison with widely assessed species such as spruce, pine or eucalyptus.

AB  - 1. The spatial insurance hypothesis states that at landscape scales with environmental variability between different places, biodiversity increases ecosystem functioning if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation, and they are highest functioning in places where they dominate the relative abundance.
   2. Under this hypothesis, observed species turnover between places in a landscape with environmental variation might suggest that species diversity is an important driver of landscape-scale ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial insurance implicitly assumes that species found in one place in the landscape will not be able to maintain high functioning in other places.
   3. Given this assumption of the spatial insurance hypothesis, we would predict that species' functioning in monoculture should decline if transplanted to a different place on an environmental gradient, away from where they naturally dominate. If this is the case, we would expect that the loss of one species in one place of the environmental gradient could not be compensated through the establishment of another species in that place. 4. We tested this prediction using a model system of marine macroalgae on intertidal rocky shores on the Swedish west coast. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with adult individuals of four fucoid seaweeds that dominate the standing stock biomass at different depths on these shores and monitored their relative growth rate over 2 months.
   5. Counter to the assumptions made by the spatial insurance hypothesis, growth rates for three of the four species showed limited responses to being transplanted to different depth zones. Spatial insurance may, hence, play a minor role in sustaining landscape ecosystem functioning in this and other systems.
   6. Synthesis. The functional consequences of species loss at landscape scales may not be as obvious as observational studies and ecological models suggest. Consequently, natural patterns of species turnover should not be used directly to argue for the role of biodiversity at landscape scales. Instead, how species may or may not be able to compensate for the loss of other species is a critical aspect if we are to understand how changes in biodiversity at the landscape scale affect ecosystem functioning.

AB  - We studied population size, genetic diversity and differentiation of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations at urban golf courses and reference natural ponds in the greater Helsinki region, southern Finland. A total of 248 tadpoles from 12 locations (six golf courses, six reference sites) were genotyped with 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The most urban populations, situated in northern Helsinki, were the largest breeding sites having > 120 (golf courses) and > 200 (reference sites) spawn clumps at the time of sampling. On average, there was no difference in the number of spawns between the anthropogenic ponds at golf courses and the natural water bodies. Genetic variation within populations was substantial (H (O) = 0.68) while genetic differentiation between populations was low (F (ST) = 0.016; average distance = 17.6 km). The golf course populations did not differ from natural populations in terms of genetic variability or differentiation. Hence, our results suggest that golf courses contribute positively to urban amphibian populations by providing suitable water bodies for reproduction and green corridors for dispersal, thus preventing isolation and loss of genetic variability within populations.

AB  - The problem of institutional fit in social-ecological systems has been empirically documented and conceptually discussed for decades, yet there is a shortage of approaches to systematically and quantitatively examine the level of fit. We address this gap, focusing on spatial fit in an urban and peri-urban regional landscape. Such landscapes typically exhibit significant fragmentation of remnant habitats, which can limit critical species dispersal. This may have detrimental effects on species persistence and ecosystem functioning if land use is planned without consideration of the spatial patterns of fragmentation. Managing habitat fragmentation is particularly challenging when the scale of fragmentation reaches beyond the control of single managers, thereby requiring different actors to coordinate their activities to address the problem at the appropriate scale. We present a research approach that maps patterns of collaborations between actors who manage different parts of a landscape, and then relates these patterns to structures of ecological connectivity. We applied our approach to evaluate the fit between a collaborative wetland management network comprising all 26 municipalities in the Stockholm County in Sweden and an ecologically defined network of dispersed but ecologically interconnected wetlands. Many wetlands in this landscape are either intersected by the boundary between two or more municipalities, or are located close to such boundaries, which implies a degree of ecological interconnectedness and a need for intermunicipal coordination related to wetland management across boundaries. We first estimated the level of ecological connectivity between wetlands in neighboring municipalities, and then used this estimate to elaborate the level of social-ecological fit vis-a-vis intermunicipal collaboration. We found that the level of fit was generally weak. Also, we identified critical misalignments of ecological connectivity and intermunicipal collaboration, respectively, as well as collaborations that represented an adequate alignment. These findings inform on where to most effectively allocate limited resources of collaborative capacity to enhance the level of social-ecological fit. Our approach and results are illustrated using maps, which facilitates the potential application of this method in land use planning practice.

AB  - In addition to being motivated by profit, the management decisions taken by non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners involve other considerations beyond timber, such as non-timber goods and services, as well as factors that affect the level of timber output from the land. Ensuring and improving forest profitability to make NIPF management viable is one of the main challenges faced by this type of landowner. This study empirically explores and assesses management by NIPF owners, through analysing attributes of forest economics (investment in holdings, expenditure on planting and silviculture, public subsidies, along with timber and non-timber incomes). With the aim of predicting outcomes, a multiple regression model was also constructed to investigate and quantify the relationship between socioeconomic and holding factors, and the planting activities carried out by NIPF owners. For this, 103 resident forest landowners in a forest region in northern Spain were interviewed in person, during March 2004, about their commitment to and involvement in land management during the period 1999-2003. The results mainly revealed that attractive forest returns and favourable market conditions for timber production are significant factors for investment in and development of forestry, with personal and family conditions also being important factors in explaining the type of land management carried out. In particular, the multiple linear regression model for forest planting activity correctly explained 84.5% of the variability observed in the study population, indicating that both the investments in and the incomes from forestry play an important role in the activity, as does the size of the holding. The findings may be of interest in promoting public measures related to timber markets and economic incentives for forest management, which will allow landowners to develop economically viable practices, as well as enabling fulfilment of social and environmental demands for sustainable forestry and rural development.

AB  - Large terrestrial carnivores are particularly prone to factors constraining levels of population genetic diversity because of their low densities and high spatial requirements. We studied the pattern of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx population genetic variability in the westernmost part of its natural range from Scandinavia to the Carpathian Mountains (north-central Europe) based on 190 samples using 613 base pair-long sequences from the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA-cr). We examined whether the population history or contemporary habitat constraints of this large and mobile carnivore could have significantly affected its genetic structure. We recorded nine mtDNA haplotypes, including five not previously reported. Lynx from Latvia and Estonia had the highest variability with haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.810.88% and 0.440.47%, respectively. In contrast, there was no polymorphism present in peripheral populations from Norway and the Carpathian Mountains. Lynx populations were strongly differentiated [analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA): F ST?=?0.570, P?<?0.001, F ST?=?0.464, P?<?0.001)]. Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance identified four separate groups of populations: (1) Norway, Finland and Estonia; (2) Latvia and North Eastern Poland; (3) the Bialowieza Primeval Forest; (4) the Carpathians. The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation suggested a number of discrete populations that are poorly connected by contemporary gene flow and could therefore be considered demographically independent. The peripheral location of these populations, habitat fragmentation and the strict territorial structure of lynx populations are factors likely contributing to the observed patterns. The study provides suggestions for active conservation/management decisions including translocations or reintroductions of lynx.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) is a large herbivore that can mediate boreal forest regeneration after timber harvest through selective browsing of tree species. Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity.

AB  - The tension between biodiversity conservation and multipurpose forest management may lead to conflicts. An internationally prominent example is the Bialowieza Forest Massif (BFM), an extensive forest complex with high levels of naturalness. We apply a systematic, multidisciplinary assessment process to review empirical evidence on different dimensions of the BFM conflict. While there is broad consensus that this forest massif is an exceptional place worth conserving and that a way forward is a zonation system combining conservation with management, exactly how this should be done has yet to be agreed upon. Our assessment shows that the key reasons for the BFM controversy go beyond the availability of knowledge on the ecological status of the BFM and include: 1) evidence stemming from different sources, which is often contradictory and prone to different interpretations; 2) knowledge gaps, particularly with regard to socio-economic drivers and beneficiaries as well as uncertainties about future trends; 3) fundamentally different values and priorities among stakeholder groups, resulting in power struggles, and an overall lack of trust. We conclude that evidence-based knowledge alone is insufficient to cope with complex conservation conflicts. While more evidence may help assess the consequences of decisions, the actual management decisions depend on different actors' worldviews, which are rooted in their professional identities and power, and their political and legal realities. This calls for conflict management through a well-organized participatory process organized and supervised by a body deemed legitimate by the groups involved.

AB  - The sword razor shell (Linnaeus, 1758) is found mainly from Norway to the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. It is intensively caught in Europe, being highly appreciated as seafood. To help in its conservation and management, five microsatellite markers were isolated and genetic variation was analyzed in samples from Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. The highly significant differentiation ( = 0.287, < 0.001) observed was mainly due to differences between samples from Irish and Iberian Peninsula localities, except Aveiro (its sample resembled the Irish samples, and it may be predominantly self-recruiting). These groups of samples showed significant differences in allelic richness that could be related to harvesting intensity. Moreover, microsatellites detected low but significant differentiation between Iberian localities (Celeiro and Olho), and Aveiro differed significantly from Strangford Lough. Overall, results suggest that two independently evolving regions exist and that management strategies should be designed for each region.

AB  - The responses of ecological communities and ecosystems to increased rates of environmental change will be strongly influenced by variation in the diversity of community composition. Yet, our understanding of how diversity is affected by rising temperatures is inconclusive and mainly based on indirect evidence or short-term experiments. In our study, we analyse the diversity and species turnover of benthic epilithic communities within the thermal flume of a nuclear power plant at the Swedish coast. This flume covers the range of predicted future temperature rises. Species composition was significantly different between control sites and sites with higher temperatures. We found that temperature had little effect on the number of species in three functional groups (macroinvertebrates, benthic diatoms, and macrophytes, which here comprise multicellular algae and macroscopic colonies of unicellular algae and cyanobacteria), neither at single sampling dates nor summed for the entire observation year. However, species turnover significantly increased with increasing temperature for diatoms, macrophytes and invertebrates. Different temperature regimes resulted in significantly different species composition and indicator species. Thus, increasing temperatures in the thermal flume increased temporal beta-diversity and decreased compositional stability of communities, although observed richness did not change at any point in time. We highlight the need to investigate the consequences of such declines in compositional stability for functional stability of ecosystem processes.

AB  - Decentralized anaerobic digestion (AD) of manure and organic residues is a possible strategy to improve carbon and nutrient cycling within agricultural regions, meanwhile generating renewable energy. To date, there has been limited adoption of decentralized AD technology in industrialized countries owing to low profitability for plant operators. There remains a need to demonstrate the wider sustainability of small-scale, decentralized AD in order to justify policy support for such a strategy. This study applies a multi-dimensional assessment of the environmental, economic and social sustainability of two scenarios of decentralized, farm-scale AD of pig slurry and organic residues in Southern Sweden. The environmental dimension was assessed by means of an expanded boundary life cycle assessment, in which trade-offs between fertilizer replacement, soil organic carbon accumulation, digestate/manure storage and application, transport and soil emissions were evaluated. The economic dimension was assessed through modelling of the net present value and internal rate of return. Finally, the social dimension was assessed by means of a stakeholder perception inquiry among key stakeholders in the field. It was concluded that the overall environmental balance of decentralized AD was favorable, while also the net present value could be positive. Fertilizer replacement, soil organic carbon and digestate storage effects were identified as important factors that should be accounted for in future life cycle assessments. A key issue for interviewed stakeholders was product quality assurance. Wider application of multi-dimensional sustainability assessment, capturing important nutrient cycling effects, could provide an evidence base for policy to support sustainable deployment of decentralized AD.

AB  - A deep understanding of vertical and horizontal structure of old-growth Norway spruce mixed forests is critical for anticipating management outcomes and developing appropriate strategies for sustaining these complex forests. In most cases, the forest structure is assessed at stand level; however, the outcomes and impacts of natural disturbances (e.g., competition-induced mortality) and human interventions on development of spruce mixed forests occur across a landscape. We compared spatial interactions and size inequality on 148 plots randomly distributed across spruce-dominated stands in the national park (NP), protected stands (PS), and managed stands (MS) of the Bialowieta Forest (BF) in north-eastern Poland. Spatial pattern analyses and Gini coefficient (GC) were used to describe the conditions of spruce mixed stands with different management strategies. Scale-dependent density of conspecifics and heterospecifics around spruce individuals, inhibition between the dbh of spruce and neighbouring trees, negative correlation between neighbourhood density and spruce dbh, and size inequality of spruce were the structural properties negatively influenced by human activities in spruce mixed stands and highlight the lasting effect of management on these structural conditions. In contrast, there was no evidence of significant difference between some structural properties, including spruce mean dbh and mean GC values of NP, PS, and MS. The vertical and horizontal structure observed across three parts of the BF reveal the importance of having variation in spatial distribution and size irregularity across PS and MS to approximate these attributes in NP. In addition, the lower dbh of spruce individuals having a con specific neighbour compared to nearby heterospecifics due to intense intraspecific competition documented in this and other comparisons between pure and mixed spruce forests argues for an increased emphasis on mixture of spruce and other species if the sustainability of spruce is considered as a management objective.

T2  - FRESHWATER QUALITY: DEFINING THE INDEFINABLE?
LA  - English
CP  - 4th Annual Conference of the Research-and-Advisory-Services-Directorate of Scottish-Natural-Heritage on Freshwater Quality - Defining the Indefinable
AB  - 1. There is a growing recognition in Scandinavia that nature conservation is vital to sustainable development, and that environmental considerations must be given equal weight to social and economic ones in the development of society. This increases the requirement for relevance and reproducibility of methods used in assessing nature conservation values.
   2. Historically, traditional conservation criteria, e.g. diversity, naturalness, representativeness, rarity, etc. have been used to describe conservation value. National parks, nature reserves, areas of national interest, and reference watercourses have been established on the basis of such criteria. Methods and value judgments have changed over time, however, and the available information is difficult to use in spatial and temporal comparisons and for management purposes. Parallel to the traditional conservation criteria, water quality criteria have been developed and used in both Norway and Sweden.
   3. The recent development is toward integration of habitat characteristics and information on organisms into systems that enable numerical descriptions and comparisons between sites and ecosystems. Furthermore, environmental objectives are increasingly being used to define direction and ambition of the environmental policies. Many of these objectives are formulated by use of criteria and numerical values that have been derived for assessment of conservation value.
   4. Monitoring and surveillance are increasingly being recognized as fundamental to nature conservation, with the dual purpose of providing baseline values for nature conservation criteria and to provide a basis for assessing compliance with environmental standards.

AB  - We present novel evidence of environmental drivers of seedling density in Abies nephrolepis, an alpine and subalpine tree species. Continuous monitoring of natural conditions is required to understand forest ecosystem dynamics. We investigated Abies nephrolepis seedling dynamics in relation to biotic and abiotic factors. The survey, which included the measurement of trees and seedlings, was carried out from March to October in 2016 and 2018. Monitoring sites in the coniferous forests of Seorak Mountain were divided into 27 quadrats. We analyzed relationships using simple and multiple linear regression. The majority of Abies nephrolepis individuals had a diameter at breast height less than l0 cm, and the number of seedlings increased over the study period. This reflects survival and growth due to successive annual mast seeding events. Aspect direction (R-2 = 0.201, p < 0.05), rock exposure (R-2 = 0.364, p < 0.001), canopy openness (R-2 = 0.322, p < 0.05), herbaceous cover (R-2 = 0.268, p < 0.01), and basal area (R-2 = 0.199, p < 0.05) show significant linear relationships with seedling density. Seedling density was positively related to rock exposure, canopy openness, and species richness, and there was a negative relationship between herbaceous cover and basal area (p < 0.0001). The relative importance of predictor variables was as follows: Rock exposure (40.3%), canopy openness (30.2%), basal area (13.9%), herbaceous cover (11.5%), and species richness (4.1%). Seedling density was most strongly influenced by the presence of large rocks, which provide shelter from harsh winds and a substrate for moss. We conclude that appropriate canopy openness creates a synergistic relationship. We found a positive association between the Abies nephrolepis seedling density in subalpine forests and certain physical environmental factors. Therefore, environmental gradients about the roles of rocks and canopies apply, even in this habitat.

AB  - European policies and instruments such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and many instruments for nature and landscape conservation in Europe have for some decades been dominated by centralisation and standardisation. This paper shows that this has led to the neglect of contextual and place-related approaches and an unnecessarily high degree of over-simplification. Recently, as a reaction to this over-simplification, diversity and specific character has been particularly stressed in many European and national strategies for rural landscapes and conservation, but the processes of simplification still continue. Using examples from mixed agriculture and forestry landscapes in Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden, this paper aims to contribute to understanding the gap between centrally defined strategies for rural landscapes and awareness and management practices at local level. The three countries are situated at the outer fringes of Europe, and are complementary with their different degrees of urbanisation, forest distribution and tree-richness in the agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, the aim is to show how local landscape management is driven and to identify factors contributing to a better use of public policies through a participatory process with visions for the future. Systems of landscape classifications such as landscape character assessment often recognise the specific character of these landscapes, but have so far achieved very little for the preservation of their locally specific values, nor have they contributed to the development and the creation of new visions for future management. Such systems could contribute much more if they could be opened to adaptation on a more local scale in communication-led management planning.

AB  - Cultural landscapes result from the application of traditional management practices usually over centuries and are amongst the most valued in Europe. However, their composition is widely threatened by modern agriculture. It is therefore necessary to understand the historical factors involved in their formation, so that appropriate policies can be developed for maintaining their character. The present paper assesses for the first time the importance of slash and burn cultivation in the formation of current landscape patterns in Southern Estonia. Although generally associated with the tropics, this practice commenced in the Baltic region in the Bronze Age and persisted until the beginning of the Twentieth Century. The historical background to the practice is given and a detailed study is then described from Karula National Park in Southern Estonia. Parcel's of different land covers were digitized from 51 farm maps for five dates from the 1860-1870's to the present day in order to record the changes. In the mid Nineteenth Century slash and burn parcels covered 35% of the farms lands. Because of the hilly relief 79% of the parcels have returned to forest during the Twentieth Century. The comparable changes are characteristic of other upland areas in Southern Estonia. The management policy in the Park needs to take into account the role of slash and burn in the formation of these areas of forest and their contribution to the modern landscape structure. The contribution to biodiversity of the secondary forests in the former slash and burn areas needs future study. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop yield has been a major target of plant breeding, although resistance and quality have also been important. The current climate change is calling for breeding actions to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The present review focuses on opportunities from plant breeding to mitigate climate change while simultaneously securing yield and food requirements, as exemplified by winter wheat cultivation in Northern Europe. Therefore, we review the history of traditional plant breeding, the impact of climate change on crops and implications for plant breeding, opportunities to use plant breeding as a tool to mitigate climate change, and then we assess the estimated mitigation effects from plant breeding and discuss their impact on climate effects. Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) was indicated as the character with the highest potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, with positive effects also from increased straw length and stubble heights, while increased total biomass yield (root or above-ground) showed less effect. In addition to contributing to climate change mitigation, NUpE might increase profitability for growers and decrease nitrogen leakage from agricultural fields. An increase in NUpE by 15% through plant breeding has the potential to result in reduced GHG emissions corresponding to 30% of the fossil fuel use in agriculture in Sweden.

AB  - Background: High-latitude forests are controlled by climate and as temperature increases, a northward extension in distribution and more vigorous tree growth are expected. The replacement of tundra by forest involves changes in carbon sequestration, land-atmosphere energy balance and ecosystems. The understanding of climate-related height and diameter growth patterns across geographical regions is therefore important. Aim: To analyse recent within- and between-region variations in climate-growth relationships for Scots pine at the forest-tundra ecotone (northern Norway, Kola Peninsula). Methods: Six pine (Pinus sylvestris) woodland sites, representing different climate regions along the forest-tundra zone, were sampled for annual height growth (saplings) and diameter growth (adult trees) and the analyses were related to local climate data. Results: Height growth was strongly similar among all sites and climate regions, but not diameter growth. Although summer temperature was the most important factor, non-growing season climate showed significant importance for both diameter and height growth across regions. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of factors that are often overlooked, specifically, non-growing season factors for tree growth at high latitudes, and the role of short-term climate variation. Future climate scenarios predict moister and milder winters for large areas of high-latitude regions. Thus, detailed analyses of region-specific climate-growth relations that focus on growing season vs. non-growing season effects are essential in the evaluation of future forest cover response to climate change.

AB  - Small changes in the large stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) can have a substantial influence on the climate impact of agriculture. We used information from a Swedish soil monitoring program, in combination with farm census data, to analyze decadal SOC concentrations and SOC stock changes on dairy farms compared with other farm types, and to quantify the climate impact of these changes on dairy farms. Soil monitoring data included topsoil samples from two inventories on 159 dairy farms, 86 beef farms, 318 arable farms, and 13 pig farms, taken at the same locations in 2001-2007 and 2011-2017. Concentrations of SOC on dairy farms (3.0%) were significantly higher than on arable farms (2.3%) and pig farms (2.4%), but not significantly different from beef farms (3.1%). SOC concentration was correlated with proportion of ley at farm scale. SOC stocks in the upper 20 cm increased significantly on dairy, beef, and arable farms, by 0.38, 0.14, and 0.21 Mg C ha(-1 )year(-1), respectively, between 2001-2007 and 2011-2017. For dairy farms, this corresponded to -1.4 Mg CO2 ha(-1) and approximately -0.22 kg CO2 kg(-1) energy-corrected milk, demonstrating that SOC changes could have a substantial influence on the climate footprint of milk.

AB  - Fire-scarred wood samples from 50 stumps, snags, and living trees of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were dendrochronologically cross-dated to describe an 800 year long fire history of Eldferdalen Nature Reserve (similar to 6 ha) and its surroundings (similar to 4000 ha) in southeastern Norway. In the western part of the study area, we recorded 55 different fires within a 200 ha area around the reserve between 1511 and 1759 and a mean fire interval in single samples of 24.6 years. The composite mean fire interval for the nature reserve was 10.5 years. Fire intervals were longer in the eastern part of the study area, with a single sample mean fire interval of 49.1 years. Only three fires were detected after 1759, the last one in 1822. Based on historical accounts, we assume that the high number of fires and short fire intervals were influenced by deliberate ignition for agricultural purposes, most likely burning to improve the conditions for cattle grazing and slash-and-burn cultivation. We suggest that the cessation of fires was influenced by the increased value of timber and mining activity, thereby leading to increased interest in conservation of the timber resources.

AB  - Wood density is well known to vary between tree species as well as within and between trees of a certain species depending on the growing environment causing uncertainties in forest biomass and carbon storage estimation. This has created a need to develop novel methodologies to obtain wood density information over multiple tree communities, landscapes, and ecoregions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dependencies between structural characteristics of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tree communities and internal wood property (i.e., mean wood density and ring width) variations at breast height. Terrestrial laser scanning was used to derive the structural characteristics of even-aged Scots pine dominated forests with varying silvicultural treatments. Pearson's correlations and linear mixed effect models were used to evaluate the interactions. The results show that varying silvicultural treatments did not have a statistically significant effect on the mean wood density. A notably stronger effect was observed between the structural characteristics and the mean ring width within varying treatments. It can be concluded that single time terrestrial laser scanning is capable of capturing the variability of structural characteristics and their interactions with mean ring width within different silvicultural treatments but not the variation of mean wood density.

AB  - Although Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most economically important European timber trees, there is still insufficient data about biomass variability and its relationships with stand features. Therefore, we aimed: (1) to develop biomass models for different aboveground biomass components at tree and stand levels, as well as biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEFs), (2) to assess the relationships between stand parameters and aboveground biomass and BCEFs and (3) to compare stand biomass obtained using BCEFs with models developed based on stand parameters (age, basal area, stand volume and mean height). Using a chronosequence (3-117years old) of 120 plots within even-aged pure Scots pine stands and 791 sample trees, we prepared tree- and stand-level allometric equations and BCEFs for aboveground biomass determination. Using stand age, density, stand volume and mean height, we prepared a set of models for biomass and BCEFs. Our study indicated that stand biomass increased with increasing height, volume and age and with decreasing stand density during stand development. Stand-level models provided better accuracy than BCEF-based models. The best predictors of biomass were stand volume and mean height. We also confirmed highly dynamic increases in stand biomass and decreases in BCEFs in the youngest phase of stand growth and relative stabilization in later stages of Scots pine stand development. The models obtained may be used in large-scale forest biomass inventories and increase our knowledge of carbon sequestration in forest biomass.

AB  - Brown bears (Ursus arctos) are threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation by infrastructure and human settlements, and have been hunted to local extinction in large areas of their former range. We analyzed the habitat use during the non denning period of 106 radio-collared bears in an expanding bear population in Sweden in relation to resorts and towns, terrain ruggedness, sex and age of bears. Bear use increased substantially with increasing distance to towns and resorts for comparable habitat and terrain types, also for independent scat surveys using DNA-analyses. More than 74% of all female bear locations were in the 29% of the terrain classified as "rugged" and located > 10 krn from any town or resort, whereas similar habitat closer to towns or resorts was avoided. Bears closer to larger settlements and resorts (< 10 km) were on average 27-51% younger than in areas beyond (mean 4.4 +/- 0.4 versus 8.9 +/- 0.8 years for males and 4.4 +/- 0.4 versus 6.0 +/- 0.2 years for females). Sub-adult bears (< 4 years) comprised up to 52% of all bear use within 10 km from resorts and settlements, likely representing exploratory dispersing individuals. These areas, however, contained only 8% of the old males (> 7 years), the remaining 92% located beyond 10 km from major resorts and settlements. Recreational resorts are developing rapidly, typically near national parks, and may thus limit expansion or fragment existing bear habitats. Together with active conservation, safeguarding undeveloped corridors of forest and rugged terrain may be important for successful recolonization of the brown bear into its original range.

AB  - We analyze economically optimal continuous cover forestry with dead wood as a biodiversity indicator. We study mixed-species stands consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L] Karst.), birch (Betula pendula Roth.), and other broadleaves (e.g., oak [Quercus sp.], maple [Acer sp.]). The analysis is based on an economic description of continuous cover forest management using an empirically estimated size-structured transition matrix model. We use size-specific decomposition rates for dead wood, with the lower limit on total dead wood volume varying between 0 and 40 m 3 ha The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form using gradient-based interior point methods. Increasing the dead wood volume requirement affects total stand density only slightly, but increases stand heterogeneity as other broadleaves are grown in higher numbers. In addition, increasing the dead wood requirement has only a minor effect on the total felled volume, but harvests shift from timber harvests to biodiversity fellings to maintain the required dead wood volume. In the optimal steady state with a high dead wood requirement, two harvesting cohorts emerge: one for timber harvests and the other for biodiversity fellings. Increasing the dead wood requirement decreases steady-state net timber income by up to 30 percent compared to the unconstrained solution.
   Study Implications: In this paper, when the dead wood requirement in the stand is increased, the requirement is fulfilled via natural mortality, and also via biodiversity fellings, i.e., harvests where the trees are left in the stand to decay. Using detailed empirically estimated growth models and harvesting cost functions, based on our results, it is economically viable to increase the amount of dead wood in continuous cover forestry. Increasing the dead wood requirement to 40 m(3) ha(-1), a level sufficient for many endangered saproxylic species, results in a 30 percent decrease in long-term steady-state net revenues compared to the economically optimal solution with no dead wood requirement. Additionally, the dead wood requirement is mainly fulfilled using tree species with a lower economic significance. As the dead wood requirement is increased, these less valuable tree species are grown in higher numbers, resulting in higher species diversity.

AB  - 1. The status of host fish populations and fish species richness was investigated at 36 sites of 20 extant freshwater pearl mussel populations, including the drainages of the Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Weser, Aulne, Kemijoki and Tuuloma in Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Finland, by carrying out comparative electrofishings.
   2. Brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) were found to be the available host fish for pearl mussels in all except one of the streams investigated with mean densities of 2861 ha(-1) (range 0-8710 ha(-1)) and a mean biomass of 119 kg ha(-1) (range 0-478 kg ha(-1)). Streams that had been frequently stocked with brown trout had higher trout biomass and densities of host fish than natural populations, but trout stocking had no positive effect in two of the streams investigated.
   3. Fish species richness ranged from 2 to 16 species per stream and showed a negative correlation with host fish biomass and host fish densities. Undisturbed oligotrophic pearl mussel headwater streams usually only yielded a low number of fish species. Habitat degradation can reduce competitiveness of specialized trout and result in an increased abundance of ubiquitous or atypical species.
   4. A link between the lack of juvenile pearl mussels and a lack of suitable host fish was only rarely observed. Functional pearl mussel populations with relatively high numbers of juveniles had significantly lower densities and biomass of host fish than pearl mussel populations Without recent recruitment.
   5. This study suggests that 0+ host fish are not necessarily required to sustain functional pearl mussel populations. Low densities of host fish can be compensated by the higher glochidia carrying capacity of older host fish with limited previous contact with pearl mussel glochidia, by the long reproductive period of mussels, and by low mortality rates of juvenile mussels during their post-parasitic phase.

AB  - The aim of the study was to explore the currently unexploited potential of agrifood waste and by-product biomasses for energy recovery and nutrient recycling, to mitigate climate change and eutrophication. The technical potential was assessed in two different case regions in Finland using two contrasting processing technologies, one oriented to recycle carbon and the other one to maximise replacement of fossil energy. The reduction in nutrient surplus through efficient recycling of biomass and consequent decline in fertiliser use was calculated. The reduction in GHG emissions was estimated based on the replacement of fossil energy and the diminished fertiliser manufacture. It was established that the full potential of use of the biomass to reduce GHG emissions can only be exploited in biorefineries that both produce energy and efficiently recycle nutrients. Such biorefineries have the potential to significantly mitigate climate change and prevent eutrophication. The potential reduction in GHG emissions corresponded to a third of agricultural emissions, and the reduction in fertiliser manufacture contributed with an additional fifth of that. The energy recovery corresponded to 5-10% of the fossil energy used in the regions, and the reduction in energy use for manufacture of fertilisers represented an additional 14-20% in comparison with that. The potential for nutrient recycling corresponded to 99-120% of P and 45-72% of N in the yields harvested in the regions. The choice of technology had a more pronounced impact on energy recovery, GHG emissions and C budget than on nutrient recycling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Colonisation is often a critical stage in the life history of plants, and recruitment success is expected to have a strong impact on plant frequencies especially among herbs. Several plant traits (seed size, plant height, leaf dry weight and specific leaf area) are suggested to be functionally important in early life stages, and the impact of such traits is expected to increase with habitat harshness. In this comparative study we examine the relative role of different plant traits for herb community patterns on both a local and regional scale in two contrasting alpine ecosystems in southern Norway: (1) a sub-continental region with more dry and productive, base-rich soils (Hol, Hallingdal) and (2) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal). Differences in species richness between regions were mainly due to higher herb richness in the base-rich region (n=55) than in the acidic region (n=13). Among traits, herb species seed weight was higher at the acidic site. The relative importance of traits for explaining herb local abundance and regional distribution tended to be stronger at the acidic site. No trait had a significant effect at the base-rich site, although seed weight and seed number were marginally non-significant. Plant clonality was positively related to local abundance and marginally to regional distribution at the acidic site. Plant frequency-trait correlations were generally higher in the acidic region then in the base-rich region. There was further a (marginal) increase of herbs with large seeds and with a dependence on sexual reproduction with increasing pH levels in Hol. Soil pH was also the most important environmental variable for herb richness in Hol, while no environmental variable was significantly related to herb richness in Setesdal. The study suggests that recruitment through seed is critical for the alpine herb community patterns especially in harsh habitats. Possible explanations for recruitment constraints include both soil acidity (low pH and Ca levels in addition to possible aluminium toxicity) and disturbance through grazing.

AB  - A pressing issue for mankind is how to combine urban expansion and food production for present and future generations. Using a case study example -the Stockholm County in Sweden-we illustrate how incorporating an ecosystem service perspective into urban planning may help us rethink the urban-rural divide in order to facilitate a sustainable development of the urban agricultural landscape of Stockholm. In our case study we show that semi-natural pollinator habitats will be 12 times as affected by the planned urban expansion than farmland. Hence, the fate and management of semi-natural pollinator habitats need to be prioritized at least as much as saving productive areas for farming in the urban expansion process. We also show that urban green areas, through their potential to act as semi-natural habitats, provide a tangible link between the pollination service and the urban planning process, contributing to a better grounding of the urban expansion in an ecosystem service reality. Also, acknowledging that land use types typically classified as "urban", such as urban green areas, can ecologically support many "rural" ecosystem services, like pollination and food production, contributes to overcoming the, often unconstructive, urban-rural divide.
   We conclude that beneath the apparent direct trade-offs between finding suitable land for urban expansion and preserving land for food production, there is potential for compromises, opportunities and synergies.

AB  - Forest Inventory and Analysis, previously known as Forest Survey, is one of the oldest research and development programs in the USDA Forest Service. Statistically-based inventory efforts that started in Scandinavian countries in the 1920s raised interest in developing a similar program in the U. S. The U. S. Congress established the research branch of the U. S. Forest Service in 1928, shortly after Dr. Yrjo Ilvessalo, leader of the first Finnish national forest inventory, met with President Calvin Coolidge. Congress charged the Forest Service to find "facts as may be necessary in the determination of ways and means to balance the timber budget of the United States". As a result, Forest Survey maintained a timber focus for much its history. As society's interest in forests changed over time, so did information needs. Conflicts over resource allocation and use could not be resolved without up-to-date knowledge of forest status and trends. In response to society's needs, the Forest Inventory and Analysis program has evolved from Forest Survey to address diverse topics such as forest health, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, air pollution, and invasive plants, while continuing its mandate to monitor the Nation's timber supply. The Forest Inventory and Analysis program collects data on all land ownerships on an annual basis. The data are used to develop reports on a regular basis; reports and raw data are available to the public at no cost. The data are also used by scientists in a growing number of applications. A short history of the Forest Survey is presented with several examples of current research based on Forest Inventory and Analysis data.

AB  - The wood bulk density, bark mass and decomposition rate constants of cut stumps of the main European boreal tree species were assessed along a 40-year chronosequence of clear-felled sites with and without prescribed burning. Using the single exponential model, the annual decomposition rate constants k of above-ground stumps were calculated as 0.048, 0.052 and 0.068 year(-1) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula sp.), respectively. Bark decomposed faster than wood and bark fragmentation increased the rate of decomposition. There was a significant negative effect of burning on decomposition rate for pine wood, and for pine and spruce bark but not for spruce and birch wood or for birch bark. The decomposition of bark of all species was slower with larger diameter stumps but only slightly slower in the case of birch wood. Our results suggest (i) using different decomposition rate constants for wood and bark, (ii) taking into account fragmentation as it greatly increases the volume loss, and (iii) adjusting of k in carbon dynamics studies on burned sites. Such refinements to estimates of coarse woody debris decomposition constants could aid in identification of ecosystems and management scenarios necessary to maximize carbon storage and conserve biodiversity. Prescribed burning for restoration purposes decreases decomposition rates and consequently ensures longer persistence of stumps for maintaining biodiversity in intensively managed forests.

AB  - Since forest planning is increasingly taking an ecological, diversity-oriented perspective into account, remote sensing technologies are becoming ever more important in assessing existing resources with reduced manual effort. While the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology provides a good basis for predictions of tree height and biomass, tree species identification based on this type of data is particularly challenging in structurally heterogeneous forests. In this paper, we analyse existing approaches with respect to the geometrical scale of feature extraction (whole tree, within crown partitions or within laser footprint) and conclude that currently features are always extracted separately from the different scales. Since multi-scale approaches however have proven successful in other applications, we aim to utilize the within-tree-crown distribution of within-footprint signal characteristics as additional features. To do so, a spin image algorithm, originally devised for the extraction of 3D surface features in object recognition, is adapted. This algorithm relies on spinning an image plane around a defined axis, e.g. the tree stem, collecting the number of LiDAR returns or mean values of returns attributes per pixel as respective values. Based on this representation, spin image features are extracted that comprise only those components of highest variability among a given set of library trees. The relative performance and the combined improvement of these spin image features with respect to non-spatial statistical metrics of the waveform (WF) attributes are evaluated for the tree species classification of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Silver/Downy birch (Betula pendula Roth/Betula pubescens Ehrh.) in a boreal forest environment. This evaluation is performed for two WF LiDAR datasets that differ in footprint size, pulse density at ground, laser wavelength and pulse width. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of the proposed method with respect to internal parameters and tree size. The results reveal, that the consideration of the crown-internal distribution of within-footprint signal characteristics captured in spin image features improves the classification results in nearly all test cases.

AB  - In Swedish Lappland, large national parks and nature reserves include forests with exceptional biodiversity values. While they are located in the ancient cultural landscapes of the indigenous Sami, this aspect has rarely been considered in the process of nature protection. In this study, we discuss how the preservation of Sami cultural values can be introduced and developed in forest reserves. We do this by reviewing recent research on the cultural legacy that the Sami have left in the boreal forest and discuss why so much of this legacy is found in the large areas of ecologically valuable forest that still exist in Lappland. We find that the Sami left deep imprints in the trees, in the forest structure, and in the archaeological record. We also find that the large forest reserves were created in the areas where the timber frontier arrived last, so they were less affected by both early actions of recurrent logging and by modern forestry. These forest reserves contain the ancient trees, the dead wood, and the disturbance regimes that favor biodiversity, and also a substantial Sami cultural legacy that has largely disappeared in the managed forest landscape. The preservation of this legacy is not without its challenges. We address the lack of inventory data, the poor collaboration between different authorities, and the general lack of involvement of the Sami communities; furthermore, we propose measures to overcome these shortcomings. If such measures are introduced, the value of the large and unique forest reserves of Swedish Lappland would be greatly enriched. The cultural legacies in forest dominated landscapes in northern Scandinavia is comparable to many other very northern or very southern regions in that they share a similar history of millennia of indigenous land use, with abrupt changes in modern time and also have large protected areas today.

AB  - Studies of past forest use traditions are crucial in both understanding the present state of the oldest European forests, and in guiding decisions on future forest conservation and management. Current management of Poland's Biatowieza Forest (BF), one of the best preserved forests of the European lowlands, is heavily influenced by anecdotal knowledge on forest history. Therefore, it is important to gain knowledge of the forest's past in order to answer questions about its historical administration, utilisation, and associated anthropogenic changes. Such understanding can then inform future management. This study, based on surveys in Belarussian and Russian archives and a preliminary field survey in ten forest compartments of BiatowieZa National Park, focuses on culturally-modified trees (CMTs), which in this case are by-products of different forms of traditional forest use. Information about the formation of the CMTs can then be used to provide insight into former forest usage. Two types of CMTs were discovered to be still present in the contemporary BF. One type found in two forms was of 1) pine trees scorched and chopped in the bottom part of the trunk and 2) pine trees with carved beehives. A second type based on written accounts, and therefore known to be present in the past (what we call a 'ghost CMT'), was of 3) lime-trees with strips of bark peeled from the trunk. Written accounts cover the period of transition between the traditional forest management (BF as a Polish royal hunting ground, until the end of the eighteenth century) and modern, "scientific" forestry (in most European countries introduced in the second half of the nineteenth century). These accounts document that both types of CMTs and the traditional forest uses responsible for their creation were considered harmful to "rational forestry" by the nineteenth-century forest administration. Thus the practices which created CMTs were banned and the trees gradually removed from the forest. Indeed, these activities drew the attention of forest administrators for several decades, and in our view delayed the introduction of new, timber-oriented, forest management in the BF.

AB  - Seagrass meadows have a high ability to capture and store atmospheric CO2 in the plant biomass and underlying sediment and thereby function as efficient carbon sinks. The seagrass Zostera marina is a common species in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, a region with strong seasonal variations in climate. How seasonality affects carbon storage capacity in seagrass meadows is largely unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess variations in sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content over a 1-year cycle in seagrass meadows on the Swedish west coast. The TOC was measured in two Z. marina sites, one wave exposed and one sheltered, and at two depths (1.5 and 4 m) within each site, every second month from August 2015 to June 2016. We found a strong seasonal variation in carbon density, with a peak in early summer (June), and that the TOC was negatively correlated to the net community production of the meadows, presumably related to organic matter degradation. There was seasonal variation in TOC content at all sediment sections, indicating that the carbon content down to 30 cm is unstable on a seasonal scale and therefore likely not a long-term carbon sink. The yearly mean carbon stocks were substantially higher in the sheltered meadow (3,965 and 3,465 g m(-2)) compared to the exposed one (2,712 and 1,054 g m(-2)) with similar seasonal variation. Due to the large intra-annual variability in TOC content, seasonal variation should be considered in carbon stock assessments and management for cold-temperate seagrass meadows.

AB  - Thinning plays a vital role in controlling stand density of plantation forests to get quality wood and more ecological function. However, the specific effects of thinning on forest biomass connected with forest age are usually overlooked especially in semi-arid regions. Here, we examined the effects of thinning on individual tree growth and stand biomass in a chronosequence of 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-year-old Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantations on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that under different thinning managements, both mean diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height followed the logistic growth pattern, and thinning promoted tree radial growth more than height. The effects of thinning on tree biomass differed between the individual tree and stand level. Thinning could promote individual tree biomass irrespective of stand ages, while stand biomass did not differ between the thinned and unthinned stands at different stand ages. Furthermore, the multiple linear regression analysis and structure equation model showed that individual tree growth was the primary contributor of stand biomass. Thus, we infer that the stand biomass loss after thinning could be mainly compensated by enhanced tree growth, especially radial growth, after a period of recovery (no more than 20 years). The results could provide helpful guidance for forest management and highlighted that reasonable thinning treatment could result in both high individual tree product and stand level harvests in the long term.

AB  - The full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use, and economic profitability of forest biomass production were studied under four alternative initial age structures of a forested landscape (young, even-aged, middle-aged and mature) in boreal conditions over 80 years. The forested landscapes occupied either by Scots pine or Norway spruce were managed by using seven management scenarios. The current thinning recommendations were considered as a baseline and alternative scenarios included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking than in the baseline. The previous ones were also managed by using N fertilization, and an unthinned scenario (with final felling) was used as a comparison. A life cycle assessment tool with inputs from a forest ecosystem model was used to calculate full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use in substituting fossil-fuel-intensive materials and fossil fuels. The results showed that increased stocking and N fertilization were generally the most optimal forest management scenarios for full climate impacts and economic profitability in both species. Increased carbon sequestration through forest management surpassed the decreased economic profitability, and no single management scenario maximized both climate impact and economic profitability. The lowest climate impact, but the highest economic profitability, was found for the initially mature age structure. The calculated average displacement factors for the harvested wood products served as valid indicators for climate impacts but could not thoroughly depict the absolute climate impacts. More research is needed to improve the dynamic connection between forest ecosystem carbon balances and the substitution effects of harvested wood products.

AB  - Inter-annual climatically driven growth variability of above-ground biomass compartments (for example, tree stems and foliage) controls the intensity of carbon sequestration into forest ecosystems. However, understanding the differences between the climatic response of stem and foliage at the landscape level is limited. In this study, we examined the climate-growth response of stem and leaf biomass and their relationship for Pinus sylvestris (PISY) and Picea abies (PCAB) in topographically complex landscapes. We used tree-ring width chronologies and time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from high-resolution Landsat scenes as proxies for stem and leaf biomass, respectively. We then compared growth variability and climate-growth relationships of both biomass proxies between topographical categories. Our results show that the responses of tree rings to climate differ significantly from those found in NDVI, with the stronger climatic signal observed in tree rings. Topography had distinct but species-specific effects: At moisture-limited PISY stands, stem biomass (tree rings) was strongly topographically driven, and leaf biomass (NDVI) was relatively insensitive to topographic variability. In landscapes close to the climatic optimum of PCAB, the relationship between stem and leaf biomass was weak, and their correlations with climate were often inverse, with no significant effects of topography. Different climatic signals from NDVI and tree rings suggest that the response of canopy and stem growth to climate change might be decoupled. Furthermore, our results hint toward different prioritizations of biomass allocation in trees under stressful conditions which might change allometric relationships between individual tree compartments in the long term.

AB  - The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in the culturally significant "Eel Coast," part of the downstream area, was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.

AB  - We compared the assemblages of bark beetles and associated beetle species among mature and overmature managed, and old-growth Picea abies (L.) Karst, dominated mesic forests in southern Finland, We established 10, 11 and 9 sample plots in these categories, respectively, within an area of 35 x 80 km. We took the beetle samples by 10 window-flight traps in each 1 ha plot (total number of traps = 300). The species richness of bark beetles was highest in old-growth, lowest in mature, and intermediate in overmature forests. This was due to the greater amount and diversity of decaying wood in old-growth forests. Bark beetles which are dependent on deciduous trees, especially Trypodendron signatum (F), were significantly more abundant in old-growth than in mature forests, obviously because deciduous trees have decreased in managed forests, The overall abundance of bark beetles was 23% higher in overmature and 30% higher in old-growth than in mature forests, but the differences were not statistically significant. Primary bark beetles comprised only 1% of the total catch, indicating that in nonepidemic conditions secondary scolytids are much more abundant than primary ones in old spruce forests. The abundance of bars beetles was best correlated with the amount of recently dead wood of the stand characteristics studied. Species associated with bark beetles showed patterns similar to those in bark beetles. The number of species was significantly higher in old-growth than in mature forests. The abundance of associated species was 61% higher in overmature and 89% higher in old-growth than in mature forests, although these differences were not statistically significant because of large inter-stand variation. It is thus likely that in the absence of major disturbances, the populations of primary bark beetles will stay at nonepidemic levels in old-growth forests. The species spectrum of bark beetles and their enemies could be broadened by promoting a deciduous mixture and improving the supply of dead trees in managed forests. This would also be beneficial to the conservation of species diversity in the managed forest landscape. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production and fate of seaweed detritus is a major unknown in the global C-budget. Knowing the quantity of detritus produced, the form it takes (size) and its timing of delivery are key to understanding its role as a resource subsidy to secondary production and/or its potential contribution to C-sequestration. We quantified the production and release of detritus from 10 Laminaria hyperborea sites in northern Norway (69.6 degrees N). Kelp biomass averaged 770 +/- 100 g C m(-2) while net production reached 499 +/- 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), with most taking place in spring when new blades were formed. Production of biomass was balanced by a similar formation of detritus (478 +/- 41 g Cm-2 year(-1)), and both were unrelated to wave exposure when compared across sites. Distal blade erosion accounted for 23% of the total detritus production and was highest during autumn and winter, while dislodgment of whole individuals and/or whole blades corresponded to 24% of the detritus production. Detachment of old blades constituted the largest source of kelp detritus, accounting for > 50% of the total detrital production. Almost 80% of the detritus from L. hyperborea was thus in the form of whole plants or blades and > 60% of that was delivered as a large pulse within 1-2 months in spring. The discrete nature of the delivery suggests that the detritus cannot be retained and consumed locally and that some is exported to adjacent deep areas where it may subsidize secondary production or become buried into deep marine sediments as blue carbon.

AB  - Degradation by drainage threatens biodiversity and globally important peatland ecosystem functions such as long-term carbon sequestration in peat. Restoration aims at safeguarding peatland values by recovering natural hydrology. Long-term effects of drainage and subsequent restoration, especially related to within-site variation of water table level and pore water chemistry, are poorly known. We studied hydrological variation at 38 boreal Sphagnum peatland sites (pristine, drained and restored) in Finland. The average water table level was significantly lower at Drained than Pristine sites especially near the ditches. We also observed large pore water chemical differences between Drained and Pristine sites, such as higher DOC concentration at the sites drained several decades earlier. Furthermore, there were large differences in water chemistry between the samples collected from ditches and from the peat strips between the ditches. For example, the ditch water had apparently higher minerogenic influence, while DOC concentrations were highest in peat strips. The water table level was, on average, at the targeted level of Pristine sites at 5 years ago restored (Res 5) and 10 years ago restored (Res 10) sites. The Res 10 sites were more similar to the Pristine sites in water chemical composition than were the Drained sites. Water chemical differences between ditches and peat strips were smaller at the Res 5 and Res 10 than at Drained sites indicating, on average, successful decrease of drainage-induced within-site variation in water chemistry. Our results suggest more pronounced water table inclination towards the old ditches at Res 10 than at Res 5 sites. While this pattern may be an early warning sign for incomplete recovery of hydrology in long-term, we found no chemical evidence supporting this assumption yet. Our study suggests that restoration can result in significant recovery of peatland hydrology within 10 years, while some deviation from pristine hydrology is still typical. Restoration appears to have potential to reduce leaching of nutrients and DOC to downstream waters in the long term, but practitioners should be prepared for temporary increase of leaching of N and P for at least 5 years after restoration of boreal Sphagnum peatlands.

AB  - The field of forestry has employed various computer-assisted optimisation approaches since the early 1960s to address the efficient allocation of resources towards various forest management objectives. These approaches continue to evolve,and in the last 5 years,the research has expanded to demonstrate how complex,non-linear relationships can be recognised and incorporated into planning processes at the tree,stand,forest and landscape levels. In addition to an overview of the use of optimisation in forestry,we provide an examination of work published in the last 5 years from 30 international journals,worldwide,which consistently publish forestry and natural resource management research papers. Through this review,we found that landscape-level optimisation is a relatively new and expanding area of research,most often performed by one large public landowner in regions where the resulting plan of action has an effect on all landowners and resources. We also note that at the forest level,exact methods for optimising systems mainly continue to be used,and at the stand level,optimisation seems to now involve exploration of a variety of analytical methods. A large portion of the recent research in the optimisation of forest management have involved European forests,which is a function of large public ownership of land and the tradition and requirements for management planning,and roughly half of the effort has arisen from researchers located in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland,Norway and Sweden).

AB  - Epichloe species are systemic fungal endophytes that usually specialize in a certain group of related grass species. We examined the infection frequency of Epichloe festucae in populations of two fine fescue species (Festuca rubra and F. ovina) in natural and seminatural habitats at 86 study sites (total = 2514 plants) across Finland and northern Norway. Infection incidence varied significantly among grass species and populations. A substantial number of the F. rubra and F. ovina populations (53 out of 77 and 25 out of 30, respectively) were either endophyte-free or had very low (< 20%) infection frequencies. The highest infection frequencies were found in subarctic areas. Moreover, infection incidence differed between habitats. In the area with the highest infection frequencies, we used microsatellite markers to study genetic diversity and the rates of gene flow of E. festucae among 12 F. rubra populations. Twenty out of the 25 fungal genotypes detected with four microsatellite markers were carrying multiple alleles in at least one locus, indicating multiple infections or vegetative hybridization of the fungus. One dominant genotype occurred in all 12 populations, representing 63.5% of all isolates. We found a moderate level of average genotypic variation and a low level of genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.0814). There was no correlation between infection frequency and genotypic diversity. Although the existence of a dominant genotype and the detected linkage disequilibrium suggest that the fungus is mainly asexual and vertically transmitted, the multiallelic loci and variation of genetic diversity among populations indicate occasional contagious spread and sexual or parasexual recombination of the fungus in some populations. Furthermore, the genotypes carrying multiallelic loci suggest the possibility of multiple infections or hybridization of the endophyte.

AB  - Carabid abundance, species richness and diversity were compared along an urban-rural gradient in Helsinki, Finland. Increased urbanization was found to result in significant reductions in species richness, though the reductions in abundance and diversity were not statistically significant. Forest habitat-specialist species were scarce in rural sites and virtually absent from urban and suburban sites. There was no evidence of higher diversity at intermediate disturbance levels (suburban sites), as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Species with flight ability and the ability to utilize open habitat were more predominant in urban and suburban sites. Flightless. species were more predominant in rural and suburban sites. Carabid abundance data were sufficient to reveal the negative impact of urbanization, so similar studies could be conducted in regions where carabid taxonomy is poorly known. Species composition patterns do, however, provide invaluable information. To conclude, if biodiversity is to be maintained in urban areas, priority must be given to the provision of those habitat features which are essential for sensitive species, such as decaying wood and wet microhabitats. These must be incorporated into urban green networks in particular, if biodiversity and species other than common generalists are to benefit from them.

AB  - As the geographic situation of Finland seems to allow no domestic carbon sequestration, cross-border CO2 logistics is needed. In this paper, the alternative transportation options for CO2 from a Finnish capture plant case are assessed. The assessment includes selection of the most favourable storage areas, route planning for both ship and pipeline transportation, and cost estimates for both alternatives. An actual CCS demonstration is planned by the proprietor power companies of the chosen case plant, a coal condensing power plant on the coast of Western Finland, giving an interesting opportunity to discuss the results in the light of the current development of the demonstration plant.
   Transportation costs are presented for a ship transportation chain from the case plant to the North Sea and for a pipeline running towards the coast of the Barents Sea. The storage areas were chosen because of the potential storage capacity and currently operational injection activities in both regions.
   Pipeline transportation is found considerably more expensive than ship transportation as an option for CO2 transportation from the case demonstration plant to the different storage sites. The levelized costs of shipping the captured CO2 to the geological formations under the North Sea are estimated to amount to 11,8 (sic)/tCO(2), excluding the costs for liquefaction.
   Matching a CO2 source within EU to a sink outside EU depends on a consistent regulatory framework. In addition to accountability of emissions allowances within the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the issues include liabilities of CO2 handling and storage, other legislation both on national and on Community level as well as international maritime conventions.

AB  - Slope aspect modifies microclimate and influences ecological processes and spatial distribution of species across forest landscapes, but the impact of slope aspect on community responses to disturbance is poorly understood. Such insight is necessary to understand landscape community dynamics and resilience. We compared bryophyte (liverworts and mosses) communities in matched 0.02-ha plots of four boreal stand types in central Sweden: recently clear-felled and mature stands dominated by Norway spruce in south-facing and north-facing slopes. Differences between forests and clear-cuts were interpreted as effects of clear-cutting, and differences between south- and north-facing slopes as effects of aspect. In response to clear-cutting, bryophyte cover and composition changed more in south-facing slopes. Only one out of ten significantly declining species in south- facing slopes also declined significantly in north-facing slopes. North-facing slopes lost fewer bryophyte species, and among those, fewer forest species and fewer species associated with wood and bark. In north-facing slopes, the average proportions of mosses and liverworts shared between the forest and the clear-cut plot were 88% and 74%, respectively. Corresponding numbers for south- facing slopes were 79% and 33%. In addition, more bryophyte species were added in north-than south- facing slopes after clear-cutting, somewhat reducing the difference in compositional change between aspects. South- and north-facing mature forests differed in species composition, mostly due to higher richness of mosses in south- facing slopes. The smaller changes in bryophyte communities on north-facing slopes in response to clear- cutting have implications for ecosystem dynamics and management as high local survival may enhance landscape-level resilience.

AB  - Context The variation in spatial distribution between ecosystem services can be high. Hence, there is a need to spatially identify important sites for conservation planning. The term 'ecosystem service hotspot' has often been used for this purpose, but definitions of this term are ambiguous.
   Objectives We review and classify methods to spatially delineate hotspots. We test how spatial configuration of hotspots for a set of ecosystem services differs depending on the applied method. We compare the outcomes to a heuristic site prioritisation approach (Marxan).
   Methods The four tested hotspot methods are top richest cells, spatial clustering, intensity, and richness. In a conservation scenario we set a target of conserving 10 % of the quantity of five regulating and cultural services for the forest area of Telemark county, Norway.
   Results Spatial configuration of selected areas as retrieved by the four hotspots and Marxan differed considerably. Pairwise comparisons were at the lower end of the scale of the Kappa statistic (0.11-0.27). The outcomes also differed considerably in mean target achievement, cost-effectiveness in terms of land-area needed per unit target achievement and compactness in terms of edge-to-area ratio.
   Conclusions An ecosystem service hotspot can refer to either areas containing high values of one service or areas with multiple services. Differences in spatial configuration among hotspot methods can lead to uncertainties for decision-making. This also has consequences for analysing the spatial co-occurrence of hotspots of multiple services and of services and biodiversity.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are one of the most important habitats in coastal regions since they constitute a multifunctional ecosystem providing high productivity and biodiversity. They play a key role in carbon sequestration capacity, mitigation against coastal erosion and as nursery grounds for many marine fish and invertebrates. However, despite these ecosystem functions and services, seagrass meadows are a threatened ecosystem worldwide. In the Baltic Sea, seagrass meadows have declined rapidly, mainly because of eutrophication, anthropogenic activities and climate change. This decline has the potential to erode the genetic variation and genetic structure of the species. In this study, we assessed how genetic variation and genetic differentiation vary among Zostera marina meadows and with a number of environmental characteristics in the county of Scania in southern Sweden. A total of 205 individuals sampled at 12 locations were analysed with 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Results showed that in spite of anthropogenic impacts and climate change pressures, locations of Z. marina possessed high genetic variation and weak genetic differentiation, with 3 major genetic clusters. Long-distance dispersal and/or stepping-stone dispersal was found among locations, with higher migration rates within the west coast. Organic matter, salinity and maximum depth appeared to be factors most strongly associated with the genetic structure and morphological variation of Z. marina. These findings contribute significantly in the identification of potential donor sites and the viability of impacted areas to recover from natural recruitment, for the development of effective transplantation measures of Z. marina in the southern Baltic Sea and temperate regions elsewhere.

AB  - Climate change has concerned the scientific community since the 1970's, stimulating research into its impacts, adaptation and mitigation. In 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established to coordinate the research. The first scientific publications on the effects of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Finland appeared in the early 1980's. After the launch of the Finnish Research Program on Climate Change (SILMU) in 1990, the number of climate-related projects and publications, and the input of Finnish researchers in the work of the IPCC started to increase. During the subsequent programs, the initial optimism about future crop production conditions changed into an awareness of the threats represented by climate change. Diversity of production and breeding of heat and flooding tolerant, disease resistant and nutrient-use efficient crop varieties were identified as being crucial for adaptation of agriculture. Efficient water management, measures to limit nutrient leaching and timely control of pests and pathogens are also crucial adaptation measures. Carbon storage in soils and biomass and reduced use of organic fields are suggested to be mitigation measures. By 2019, the awareness of the threats of climate change prompted citizens worldwide to demand action, and government programs have begun to include policies addressing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Aspen (Populus tremula L.) is associated with high biodiversity and provides high-quality forage for wild browsing herbivores in boreal and temperate ecosystems. The long-term persistence of aspen in many regions in Scandinavia has been questioned due to the historically high browsing levels. We here review the basic ecology, genetics and life histories of aspen in a browsing context. Browsers can suppress the regeneration of aspen and the relatively short lifespan of the trees result in frequent regeneration cycles and concurrent exposure to browsers. In the long term, browsing may reduce recruitment and delay maturation, increase mortality and ultimately cause a decline of aspen. Norwegian forest inventory data indicate a reduced recruitment rate of young aspen (diameter at breast height; 60-79 mm) during the last 25 years, but it is unclear whether this is all due to browsing. Regeneration may also be hampered by lack of disturbance. Recent genetic studies have shown that aspen may have substantial regeneration by seeds, which allows for effective migration. The main conclusion of this review is that although browsing may affect demography and local abundance of aspen, it is very unlikely to lead to the eradication of the species in Fennoscandia.

AB  - We review the effects of human impact on biodiversity of European forests in the light of recent views on disturbances and succession in ecosystems, and discuss recent ideas on how biodiversity affects ecosystem functions such as productivity and ecosystem stability. With this as a background we discuss how to better manage European forests for both production and biodiversity. We argue that the next generation of forestry practices need to understand and mimic natural disturbance dynamics much better than the present ones. Of particular importance is the fact that most species in European forests have evolved in forests that were to a large extent influenced by large grazers, first by megaherbivores and later, in historic times, by domestic animals. We highlight several areas where new knowledge and management tools are urgently needed: (i) How do species survive and adapt to the natural disturbance regimes in different regions and forest types? (ii) How can new and imaginative forest management practices be devised that take natural disturbance regimes into account? (iii) How does forest biodiversity affect ecosystem function and stability in a changing world, in particular in the light of predicted climate changes? (iv) How are ecological processes at different levels and scales related to diversity, and how do different management practices affect biodiversity? (v) How can efficient agroforestry methods be developed to preserve biodiversity? (vi) What is the role of humans and human behaviour for sustainable management of ecosystems?

AB  - This paper presents global research trends involving highly cited articles on ecosystem services from 1981 to 2017 based on a bibliometric analysis of such articles from the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe.

AB  - Today's overall challenges of reindeer pastoralism, i.e., pasture degradation, climate change, conflicting land use, and predation as well as the underlying meshwork of ecology, socio-economy, culture, and politics requires further research. Overutilization of pastures, reinforced by their general loss has led to a decrease in body weight of reindeer, higher mortality, and lower reproduction in parts of Fennoscandia; therefore, this calls for sustainable pasture management based on adapted pasture utilization. This study focuses on different regions in Norway and contributes to current research by implementing and testing a new methodological framework that aims at the joint evaluation of fine-scale spatio-temporal patterns of pasture resources and their actual utilization from a reindeer's perspective, including an upscaling to spatial entities relevant for management. While we gained valuable insights into the micro-spatial heterogeneity of arctic-alpine ecosystems in terms of pasture resources to be determined by interacting ecological processes and functionalities rather than structures, it were exactly these processes and functionalities that rendered any meaningful upscaling impossible: functionally decoupled from patterns at a broader scale, they could not be derived from the commonly available broad-scale structural data. Hence, approaches that integrate over the micro-spatial variability of arctic-alpine environments along with models that estimate pasture resources must lead to miscalculations of the available resources. Additionally, our findings on habitat preferences, which mirror the available usable resources, point to the fact that organisms experience their environment neither at coarse nor single scales, indicating that any aggregation bias can be significant in projections that do not consider the appropriate scales and inherent functionalities when judging available resources to be utilized. Inaccurately estimated available pasture resources and a utilization of these resources by reindeer that is highly variable in space and time (and thus cannot be described by a single model) have important implications for the management of reindeer pastoralism. Currently, only rough guidelines can be provided; these guidelines need to be combined with the traditional knowledge of the herders to achieve an optimal utilization of the pastures.

AB  - 1. We examined data on soft-sediment macrobenthos (organisms retained on a 1-mm, sieve) from a transect of c. 1960 km along the Norwegian continental shelf (56-71degreesN), covering a range of water depths (65-434 m) and varying sediment properties.
   2. A total of 809 species was recorded from 101 sites. Of these, 36% were restricted to one or two sites, and 29% were represented by one or two individuals. No species spanned the entire transect. Polychaetes were the dominant taxonomic group, followed by crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms.
   3. Alpha diversity (sample species richness) was highly variable (35-148 species) but showed no evidence of a relationship to latitude or other environmental variables.
   4. Beta diversity was measured as Whittaker's beta(W), the number of shared species, complementarity (biotic distinctness) and Bray-Curtis similarity, and there was no evidence of a latitudinal trend on the shelf. Beta diversity increased with the level of environmental variability, and was highest in the southern-central area, followed by the most northern area. Change in environmental variables had a stronger effect on beta diversity than spatial distance between sites.
   5. Gamma diversity was computed by pooling samples over large areas. There was no convincing evidence of a latitudinal cline in gamma diversity, but gamma diversity increased with the level of environmental heterogeneity. Mean alpha diversity and gamma diversity were not significantly correlated. Whereas mean complementarity and mean Bray-Curtis similarity were related to gamma diversity, beta(w) was not.

AB  - Ecosystem-based protection is becoming a viable adaptation option to conventional engineered solutions to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. While the environmental and biological ecosystem services provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that may accrue through eelgrass Zostera marina restoration in tandem with beach nourishment in southern Sweden. The empirical research is based on an on-line open-ended questionnaire in the coastal municipalities of Bastad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kristianstad. The results demonstrate that virtually all respondents had noticed a change in the coastline in recent years, mainly that the coastline had retreated. While beach nourishment measures were recognized among respondents to counter the shoreline erosion, there was very little understanding of the role that eelgrass plantations can play in creating biodiversity and benefits for society. Still, most acknowledged the importance of making room for water and biodiversity at the coast stating how the coastline was valued for primarily health and spiritual reasons. This knowledge will help local, regional and national decision-makers and regulatory authorities to make evidence-based choices for coastal protection, by complementing the analysis of environmental and physical ecosystem-services with cultural and socio-economic considerations. Nature-based solutions such as eelgrass reintroduction or beach nourishment should be tailored to the values, perspectives and perceptions of the local communities to help ensure their continued contribution to biodiversity.

AB  - Inclusion of spatially explicit information on ecosystem services in conservation planning is a fairly new practice. This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2%) and the non-use zone (+3.2%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79%.

AB  - Territory mapping and transect counts were made in upland birch scrub (46 ha) in north-east Scotland to document the bird community and assess responses of birds to habitat variation. The bird community was species poor, supporting approximately 20 species. Richness and diversity were low compared with other British scrub habitats. The two dominant species were Willow Warbler (52% of territory mapping registrations) and Chaffinch (18% of registrations). Densities derived from territory mapping and transect counts (Distance sampling) were similar. Willow Warbler densities were high and comparable with preferred habitats in lowland England and Fennoscandia. Contour mapping, correlation and canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that successional stage, represented by birch cover, was the single most important factor determining community composition and individual species' distributions. Meadow Pipits persisted at low densities in sparse birch; Tree Pipits occurred throughout the range of birch densities. Willow Warblers preferred areas of medium height birch at intermediate canopy cover. Wren, Great Tit and Long-tailed Tit occurred in older birch scrub. The relatively simple bird-habitat relationships reported are contrasted with more complex patterns elsewhere. These findings are discussed in the context of scrub and woodland regeneration in upland Britain with particular reference to mosaics and maintenance of avian diversity.

AB  - Norway has vast rangeland resources (292,361 km(2)) with an estimated carrying capacity of nearly four million sheep and lambs, twice the current number. However, the intensive production system currently applied has led to more concentrate dependency, resulting in heavier animals in addition to poorer utilization of rangelands and homegrown feed. Intensive feeding systems indirectly influence the sustainability of ecosystems by promoting intensive cropping that can deplete soil fertility and threaten landscape preservation and biodiversity. By contrast, extensive grazing systems can produce environmentally and animal-friendly food products and contribute to regulating soil health, water and nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration, and recreational environments. In this paper, the economics of current sheep feeding practices in Norway, using a linear programming model, were compared with more extensive systems which allow for higher usage of on-farm feed resources. Changes in current sheep farming practices have the potential to increase lamb meat production relative to mutton production, in addition to improving the year-round supply of fresh meat. The investigated alternatives, using the Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) breed, suggest that delayed lambing is useful only on farms with abundant pastures available for autumn feeding. Lambs achieve a better market price than hoggets and mature sheep. Therefore, based on the current Norwegian meat market and price offered per kilogram of meat for lamb, an increase in NWS lamb production improves farm profits. On the other hand, when the aim is on greater use of homegrown feed and rangelands, this can be achieved through hogget production, and the quantity of concentrates required can be reduced substantially.

AB  - Understanding the effects of nitrogen deposition, ozone and climate on tree growth is important for planning sustainable forest management also in the future. The complex interplay of all these factors cannot be covered by experiments. Here we use observational data of mature forests for studying associations of various biotic and abiotic factors with tree growth. A 30 year time series on basal area increment of Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies Karst. in Switzerland was analyzed to evaluate the development in relation to a variety of predictors. Basal area increment of Fagus sylvatica has clearly decreased during the observation period. For Picea abies no trend was observed. N deposition of more than 26 (beech) or 20-22 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (Norway spruce) was negatively related with basal area increment, in beech stronger than in Norway spruce. High N deposition loads and low foliar K concentrations in Fagus were correlated with increased drought sensitivity. High air temperatures in winter were negatively related with basal area increment in Norway spruce in general and in beech at high N:Mg ratio or high N deposition while on an average the relation was positive in beech. Fructification in beech was negatively related to basal area increment. The increase of fructification observed during the last decades contributed thus to the growth decrease. Ozone flux was significantly and negatively correlated with basal area increment both in beech and Norway spruce. The results show clear non-linear effects of N deposition on stem increment of European beech and Norway spruce as well as strong interactions with climate which have contributed to the growth decrease in beech and may get more important in future. The results not only give suggestions for ecological processes but also show the potential of an integral evaluation of observational data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic diversity is needed for species' adaptation to changing selective pressures and is particularly important in regions with rapid environmental change such as the Baltic Sea. Conservation measures should consider maintaining large gene pools to maximize species' adaptive potential for long-term survival. In this study, we explored concerns regarding genetic variation in international and national policies that governs biodiversity and evaluated if and how such policy is put into practice in management plans governing Baltic Sea Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Germany. We performed qualitative and quantitative textual analysis of 240 documents and found that agreed international and national policies on genetic biodiversity are not reflected in management plans for Baltic Sea MPAs. Management plans in all countries are largely void of goals and strategies for genetic biodiversity, which can partly be explained by a general lack of conservation genetics in policies directed toward aquatic environments.

AB  - Since several years already, a massive infestation of bark beetle has taken place in the BialowieZa Forest, decimating a local Norway spruce population. In consequence, many open areas appeared, practically deprived of trees and other forest vegetation. The existence of such areas has a very negative impact on multiple values of the BialowieZa Forest: natural, social, economical and landscape -aesthetic values. The local forest administration prepared a strategy aimed at active restoration of diverse woodland communities typical for the BialowieZa Forest in all places, where bark beetle infestation wiped up the spruce stands. Those plans were criticized by representatives of the environmental organizations who blamed the foresters for transforming the BialowieZa Forest into 'plantation' and claiming that such measures are inconsistent with the existing forest management and protection plan. The postulate of environmentalists is that the recovery of woodland communities should proceed completely naturally. Taking into account the above mentioned controversies, in this paper we examine the issue of natural regeneration in the BialowieZa Forest in detail. In particular, we try to determine to which extent this method of forest reproduction enables re-establishment of compositionally diverse woodland communities, distinguished by a high level of biological diversity and able to provide a wide range of commodities and benefits important for today's society. Based on an extensive literature review we show that a combination of different (abiotic and biotic) factors, influencing establishment and subsequent growth of seedlings and saplings in the BialowieZa Forest has long been strongly unfavorable for many tree species. In this regard, one should particularly emphasize the negative role of large herbivores, especially red deer, which is present in the BialowieZa Forest since the end of 19th century, when it became a private hunting ground for Russian tzars. The devastating effect of deer browsing on natural regeneration is a well-documented phenomenon and widely recognized problem in the forestry practice. The fencing of young forest generation against game pressure is an indispensable measure, needed to secure the continuous existence of several tree species (first of all those palatable and vulnerable to browsing). Very strong arguments for an active approach to the described problem delivers also a long-term study on natural forest dynamics conducted since 1936. It shows that under conditions of strict protection the regeneration capacity of the BialowieZa tree species is very variable. These differences lead to the compositional simplification and impoverishment of many tree stands, with numerous negative consequences for local biodiversity. We underline that an active management strategy is a basic prerequisite for maintaining a diverse character of the BialowieZa stands and their ability to provide all important ecosystem services on a sustainable basis. Such a strategy should include, beside of the phase of establishment, also the subsequent developmental stages of new forest generations. 'The general goal of such a strategy should be to secure a possibly high diversity of tree composition and to enable the development of tree species representing a full range of life-history strategies and playing different successional roles: from typical pioneer species, through intermediate, to climax species.

AB  - Governing urban green infrastructure is challenging due to the various institutions, interests and values involved in municipal planning, decision-making and management processes. Indicators of urban ecosystem services and green infrastructure may support the development of mutual understanding among municipal authorities and the creation of usable information. In this study, the application of ecosystem services (ES) indicators is approached through knowledge-brokering and boundary work theories. We apply a set of GIS-based ES indicators in a medium-sized Finnish city in a collaborative process with local civil servants in order to provide overarching information on the green infrastructure and to enhance dialogue among civil servants. We present the three phases of the indicator application process (conceptual, instrumental and reflection phases) describe the indicator-based boundary work, and identify factors affecting the process. The results highlight the importance of collaboration and active knowledge brokering in indicator applications, involving a combination of conceptual and methodological expertise on the ES approach with knowledge on local environment and relevant policy and planning issues, as well as iterative reflection throughout the indicator application process. Finally, some critical characteristics of boundary work in applying the ES indicators are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Projected changes in precipitation regimes can greatly impact soil biota, which in turn alters key ecosystem functions. In moss-dominated ecosystems, the bryosphere (i.e., the ground moss layer including live and senesced moss) plays a key role in carbon and nutrient cycling, and it hosts high abundances of microfauna (i.e., nematodes and tardigrades) and mesofauna (i.e., mites and springtails). However, we know very little about how bryosphere fauna responds to precipitation, and whether this response changes across environmental gradients. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment to study the effect of volume and frequency of precipitation on the abundance and community composition of functional groups of bryosphere fauna. Hylocomium splendens bryospheres were sampled from a long-term post-fire boreal forest chronosequence in northern Sweden which varies greatly in environmental conditions. We found that reduced precipitation promoted the abundance of total microfauna and of total mesofauna, but impaired predaceous/omnivorous nematodes, and springtails. Generally, bryosphere fauna responded more strongly to precipitation volume than to precipitation frequency. For some faunal functional groups, the effects of precipitation frequency were stronger at reduced precipitation volumes. Context-dependency effects were found for microfauna only: microfauna was more sensitive to precipitation in late-successional forests (i.e., those with lower productivity and soil nutrient availability) than in earlier-successional forests. Our results also suggest that drought-induced changes in trophic interactions and food resources in the bryosphere may increase faunal abundance. Consequently, drier bryospheres that may result from climate change could promote carbon and nutrient turnover from fauna activity, especially in older, less productive forests.

AB  - Litter decomposition is an important driver of terrestrial systems, and factors that determine decomposition rate for individual litter species have been widely studied. Fewer studies have explored the factors that regulate how mixing litters of multiple species affects litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics, and only a handful of studies have investigated how litter-mixing effects may differ among different habitats or ecosystems, or how they respond to environmental gradients. We used a well-established retrogressive chronosequence involving thirty lake islands in northern Sweden in which time since fire disturbance increases with decreasing island size; smaller islands therefore have reduced rates of aboveground and belowground ecosystem processes. On each of these islands we utilized plots with and without the long-term experimental removal of shrubs. Litters from the six most common plant species on the islands were prepared in single-, three- and six-species litterbags, and placed on both the shrub-removal and non-removal plots on each island to decompose for one year. We found significant non-additive effects of litter mixing on litter decomposition rates, on final litter N and P concentrations, and on litter N loss, but these non-additive effects varied both in direction and magnitude with changed number of species, and even among litter mixtures with the same number of species. Further, the magnitude of non-additive effects of litter mixing on both litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics was significantly influenced by both island size and the interaction between island size and shrub-removal treatment. When shrubs were present, there was a U-shaped relationship between these non-additive effects and island size, while the relationship was positive when shrubs were removed. Hence, our results support previous findings that litter mixing may produce non-additive effects on litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics, and that these effects tend to be idiosyncratic due to the importance of effects of individual species in the mixture. Most importantly, our results show that non-additive litter-mixing effects change greatly across environmental gradients, meaning that the biotic and abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem can be a powerful driver of the magnitude and even the direction of litter-mixing effects on ecosystem processes.

AB  - Combined effects of litterfall and root turnover significantly increase topsoil carbon stocks in Norway spruce and European beech mixed forests, indicating local complementarity effects mediated by tree species mixtures.
   The establishment of mixed stands by intermingling individuals of European beech and Norway spruce is an ongoing trend in adaptive forest management strategies. However, our understanding of the potential of these strategies to promote C sequestration remains limited.
   This study aims to assess the effect of species composition on SOC stock in a mixed forest of Norway spruce and European beech.
   We studied C stocks in the uppermost soil layers in two stands dominated either by Norway spruce or European beech and in a mixture of both species. We evaluated the effect of litterfall and root turnover on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and its spatial distribution by combining structural equation models and geostatistical techniques.
   C stocks in the forest floor were highest in Norway spruce, whereas in the mineral soil, the highest values were in the mixed stand. The proportion of Norway spruce litterfall was positively related to C stock in the forest floor across stands. Root turnover was positively related to C stock in the mineral soil of the mixed stand.
   Our results confirm a contrasting role of root turnover and litterfall between soil layers in the studied stands, suggesting that tree species composition can mediate the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in mixed forests.

AB  - Eutrophication is known to affect the community structure of macroalgae by e.g. decreasing the depth penetration of species and by shifting dominance from perennial to annual species. However, there is substantial lack of knowledge in the Baltic Sea regarding the distribution of many of the macroalgal species, how natural environmental factors affect their occurrence and how they respond to eutrophication. As macroalgae are used as indicators of the quality of the sea areas in the EU legislation (Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive), this kind of knowledge is essential. The aim of this study was to determine which variables were related to variation in species occurrence and their lower limit of occurrence in the Finnish marine area. The study was carried out on data from five study areas along the Finnish coastline and included about 30 taxa. Our results showed that both the macroalgal communities and the occurrence (presence/absence) of most of the species differed between the study areas and that the differences were mainly related to salinity and exposure, although also eutrophication related factors played a role. Of the perennial species, eutrophied conditions seemed to favour only the occurrence of Sphacelaria arctica and Polysiphonia fucoides. Secchi depth was important in determining the lower limit of occurrence of brown and red algal species. However, Secchi depth was rarely the only factor causing variation in the lower limit of occurrence as also exposure, salinity and slope of the shore affected it. We conclude that in the northern Baltic Sea, the taxonomic composition of the macroalgal communities is not a very useful indicator of eutrophication as perennial species seem to tolerate rather eutrophied conditions, when suitable substrate is available. The lower limit of occurrence of many of the brown and red algal species is a good indicator of eutrophication but due to lack of suitable substrate in more eutrophied areas, especially in the depths where light becomes limiting, it is only applicable in the middle and outer archipelago areas. Furthermore, when planning monitoring programmes or setting thresholds for evaluating the ecological status of the sea, the natural variation in the lower limit of occurrence of macroalgae across sea areas is problematic and should carefully be taken into account.

AB  - For several centuries, game management has involved translocations of non-native individuals of many species to reinforce local native populations. However, there are few quantitative studies of potentially negative effects on population viability as expected when taxa with different local adaptations hybridise. The European red deer has been subject to particularly many translocations. Around 1900, a total of 17 red deer of Hungarian (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus) and German (C. e. germanicus) origin were introduced onto the island of Otteroya in Norway where few native red deer (C. e. atlanticus) remained n similar to 13). To assess interbreeding, the present stock on Otteroya and the indigenous Norwegian and Hungarian populations were characterised in 14 microsatellite loci and in the control region of mtDNA. An intermediate level of genetic variation in the Otteroya population and the presence of population specific alleles from both the indigenous Norwegian and the Hungarian population demonstrate that the introduced red deer interbred with the native. Even distributions of one indigenous and one non-indigenous mtDNA haplotype in the Otteroya population and two point estimates of admixture indicate similar genetic contributions from the two parental populations into the hybrid stock. Low numbers of migrants identified with Bayesian assignment tests demonstrate low recent gene flow from Otteroya into the Norwegian mainland population. The Otteroya hybrid stock has grown vastly in numbers during recent decades, suggesting a high population viability. We observed that the body mass of red deer on Otteroya was similar or greater than in adjacent indigenous Norwegian stocks, indicating that population performance has not been reduced in the hybrid stock and that gene flow probably has not had any negative effects.

AB  - Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) in tree rings have been increasingly used as indicators of climatic and ecological processes. However, compared to inter-annual delta C-13 variability, the factors related to inter-tree and -site variability (i.e., dendroclimatic noise) have attracted less attention. Here we present a statistical study quantifying the inter-tree and -site variability in a tree-ring delta C-13 dataset in the context of biogeographical, climatic, and forestry variables. This dataset originates from sixty-seven Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees growing in seven sites in the north boreal forests and near the subarctic timberline in Finnish Lapland. Using estimates from a linear mixed model, we identified a set of three constraints, possibly behind the inter-tree and -site delta C-13 variations. First, a latitudinal constraint was found with more negative delta C-13 values in colder (timberline) conditions, in comparison to trees in south of timberline. Second, a longitudinal constraint appeared to result in more negative delta C-13 levels in the eastern sites. Third, an altitudinal constraint led to less negative delta C-13 levels at higher altitudes. Additional source of inter-tree and -site delta C-13 variations attributable to tree size variables resulted in less negative delta C-13 values in taller trees with larger crowns. As the tree size and age are closely connected in our data, these results supported earlier findings that Pinus delta C-13 data may exhibit age-related changes. These results were consistent with mechanistic links between environmental drivers and carbon isotope fractionation. The extent of inter-tree and -site variability affected the length of confidence intervals around the mean delta C-13 value. The use of statistical power analyses was highlighted for assessing the required sample size to estimate the mean value.

AB  - This paper identifies a number of essential ecosystem services, and estimates their generation by the Swedish agricultural landscape under different production intensities. This is exemplified with data from a low-intensity period (1950s) and a high-intensity one (1990s). The services are described in qualitative and, to the extent possible, quantitative terms, and the ecological functions that support these services are identified. About 20% of Swedish agricultural land has been removed from production during the past 40 years. Production has been strongly intensified with respect to external inputs, and specialized regionally. Local landscape mosaics have been substantially altered, which resulted in a decreased ability of agricultural landscapes to support natural ecosystem components and processes. We argue that all of these changes affect the ability of the landscape to generate ecosystem services. Local, ecological 'goods and services' have largely been replaced by fossil fuel driven technology and the regulation of the system is now driven much more by external factors. However, there is no notable change in the system's ability to assimilate solar energy, measured by net primary production (NPP) and corrected for the cost of production (external inputs considered as foregone NPP). Most of the measures we derive indicate a loss of ecosystem services from the Swedish agricultural landscape. This is tantamount to losing an important form of 'local ecological insurance', and could lead to serious problems in a future with lower access to external resources, or with an altered energy policy.

AB  - Low nitrogen (N) supply is a limiting factor for plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems. N-fixing legumes therefore have the potential to facilitate surrounding vegetation by increasing soil N levels. This effect should be especially pronounced in low-productivity habitats where ambient soil N levels are low, such as in alpine areas. We examined whether plant species composition, community diversity measures, and soil N levels differed with and without the presence of two alpine legumes, Oxytropis lapponica (Wahlenb.) Gay and Astragalus alpinus L., in a Dryas octopetala heath at Finse, Norway. Species composition and richness differed between plots with and without Oxytropis in one of two study sites, as other plant species were positively associated with the legume. None of the measured community properties differed between plots with and without the presence of Astragalus. The contrasting influence of the two legume species corresponds to our findings of higher soil N levels below Oxytropis, but not Astragalus. Differences in microhabitat N levels may explain why only Oxytropis acts as a facilitator. By affecting local species composition Oxytropis increases spatial heterogeneity, which may increase total species richness of the ecosystem.

AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a technology that can help reduce CO2 emissions and thereby mitigate global warming. The temperature of the available cooling medium effects many of the processes relevant to CCS and in particular, low ambient temperature helps reduce the power consumed by compression and liquefaction processes needed to prepare CO2 for transportation, e.g., in pipelines or tanker ships. The aim of this paper is to look at energy usage in different geographic locations and identify the benefits of preparing CO2 for transportation in a cold climate. The main finding is that the pipeline alternative consumes 10-15% more energy in the Middle East than in Northern Norway and 25-30% more if the CO2 is liquefied. Lower temperature also offers an opportunity to simplify CO2 compressor design. The most efficient refrigerant for CO2 liquefaction is NH3 (R717), but CO2 (R744) is a practical alternative for cold climates.

AB  - Food security under climate change, several sustainability problems, and ambitious climate targets are considered challenges for agriculture and food sectors in many countries. Since agricultural production and its land use produce appr. 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Finland, reducing agricultural GHG emissions is important for meeting national target of climate neutrality by 2035. Healthier food diets, maintenance of biodiversity, and reduced nutrient leaching from agriculture are also required for a more sustainable food economy. This paper aims to show how agriculture in Finland, traditionally dominated by livestock production, could decrease GHG emissions significantly and simultaneously respond to other sustainability concerns. Our results, based on economic modelling of the agricultural sector, suggest that moderate changes in food diets and land use can reduce GHG emissions of agriculture by more than 40% by 2050 if productivity growth and policy changes support the overall change in the agriculture and food sector. Adaptation to climate change, e.g. more higher crop yields efficient input use, is necessary for productivity growth. Decreased demand for meat and decreased cultivation of feed crops would decrease GHG emissions and free up land for carbon sequestration through afforestation. Whilst healthier food diets imply less livestock and increased imports of protein crops for food, a reasonable volume of livestock production is useful for maintaining food security, grasslands, crop rotations, soil carbon, and biodiversity. We conclude that transition to low carbon and more sustainable agriculture is possible without risking food security at northern latitudes.

AB  - We studied the influence of clear felling and new alternative forest regeneration methods on soil macroarthropods during the first 3 years after the harvesting. We focused on changes in the abundances of functional groups, and community structure at the levels of species (Coleoptera) or higher taxa. The experiment was carried out in central Finland in spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands on I ha study plots. The following five treatments were used in addition to the untreated controls: (1) selection felling (70% of the stand volume retained), (2) gap felling (0.1-0.2 ha gaps felled), (3) gap felling with site preparation, (4) retention felling (small groups of trees retained on clear-felled area) and (5) traditional clear felling with site preparation. As expected the changes in macroarthropod community were attributed to harvesting intensity (proportion of living stand volume removed): clear felling and gap fellings induced the clearest changes, while selection felling had hardly any impacts. The treatments had no effects on total numbers of macroarthropods during the 3-year study period. Clear felling and gap felling followed by harrowing had a negative effect on predators, among which spiders decreased the most, and herbivores. Gap felling without harrowing had similar but not as strong effects as the treatments with harrowing. Further, in the unprepared gaps herbivores showed signs to recover in the second growing season after the treatment. Community structure (analysed by the NMDS ordination method) was affected by the treatments both at high taxonomic level and at the species level. At higher taxonomic level, the changes were induced by clear felling and gap fellings; the alterations being, however, no larger than natural temporal variation. At the species level (Coleoptera adults), the effects on community structure were more pronounced: the set of dominant beetle species changed almost completely after clear felling and the gap fellings during the study period, but the number of species or evenness values were not affected by the treatments. Changes in community structure at both resolutions correlated clearly with harvesting intensity and subsequent vegetation change. Our study gave evidence that the total abundance of macroarthropods, species diversity as well as community structure at higher taxonomic level are relatively resistant in the short term to environmental changes caused by forest regeneration practices in boreal coniferous forests.

AB  - Development of general theories and subsequent empirical testing are fundamental ingredients in ecological science. The progress of such efforts is determined by the logical coherence among central concepts, theories, and predictions on one hand, and experimental design, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results on the other. Here, we specifically explore an example of how differences in the way ecological concepts are defined lead to differences in the formulation and statistical testing of hypotheses and ultimately to differences in conclusions about the relative importance of ecological processes.
   In marine intertidal habitats, the notion that wave exposure has an important structuring role is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, generalizations about its effects and use for accurate prediction of assemblages are often limited. This may partly be explained by the frequent use of categorical rather than quantitative definitions of wave exposure. We compared the conclusions about the importance of wave exposure from (1) analyses of variance based on relative classification of wave exposure and geographic location to those of (2) regression analyses based on continuous measures from 16 locations on the Swedish west coast.
   Variability in richness was substantially better explained by the regression analyses, while for the cover of individual taxa there was no consistent difference between the two analytical approaches in terms of explained variability. The two approaches detected significant spatial patterns for the same taxa, but conclusions about the nature of these patterns were often divergent. Categorical analyses of relative measures of wave exposure and geographic location indicated that interactive effects and differences between geographic areas were predominant. Regression analyses of absolute, continuous measures suggested that mean significant wave height was a better predictor than geographic location and interactive terms. Thus, the choice of definition of wave exposure has important consequences. for how causes of spatial patterns of intertidal assemblages are perceived. Categorical analyses appear to provide clearer indications as to which factors are important while the use of continuous predictors sometimes provides a better fit to the data. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the context of rocky shore ecology as well as in a general perspective of ecological models, hypotheses, experimentation, and analysis.

AB  - Areas suitable for outdoor recreation are in decline due to urbanization and land-use intensification. To provide people with access to recreational areas, it is imperative to understand what characterizes areas attractive to recreationists. In this study we explore patterns of outdoor recreation visits on a national scale, using a large (n = 3853) Public Participatory GIS survey in Sweden. We analyze land cover of areas visited in comparison to landscape composition across a gradient from urban to rural areas. Additionally, we employ machine learning models to compare attributes of areas visited to random areas in the available landscape. We found that the geographical distribution of outdoor recreation was highly aggregated, with 57 % of recreation occurring in urban and periurban areas, which together cover 5 % of the total land area. Landscape characteristics were weak predictors of where outdoor recreation took place. The median travel distance to the area where recreation was conducted was 2 km, which is longer than what recreationists prefer according to previous studies. We argue that this is indicative of a recreational deficit in Sweden, with recreationists' preferences not being expressed due to lack of access to suitable areas close to home. This highlights the importance for physical planners to consider spatial accessibility when planning for outdoor recreation.

AB  - Around the world, Indigenous peoples seek increased control of traditional lands. In northern Canada, such control may be afforded by claims-based co-management regimes. Such regimes are a common, and sometimes celebrated, component of treaty federalism. In Norway, Europe's only Indigenous people, the Sami, now participate in a land-management regime: the Finnmark Estate (FeFo). We explore whether FeFo is, in effect, claims-based co-management and whether Sami thus enjoy the sort of guaranteed shared rule envisioned in treaty federalism. We compare FeFo to Canadian co-management in three dimensions: novelty, independence and Indigenous influence. We conclude FeFo is indeed claims-based co-management. But FeFo falls short of the treaty-federal ideal, for reasons possibly including bureaucratic capture, fragile legitimacy, conflicting interpretations of the Sami interest and conflicting views on the merits of shared rule.

AB  - At a global level, it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of ecosystem services have been degraded in just fifty years. The additional stresses imposed by climate change will require extraordinary adaptation. This paper synthesises main result of a large Finnish project studying the vulnerability of key ecosystem services to climate change and the possibilities for the individual sectors to adapt to these changes. The project based its work on data and infrastructures of nine intensively studied areas belonging to the Finnish LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network. The methods developed and used included remote sensing, derivation of impact scenarios, dynamic modelling, laboratory experiments, interactive workshops and expert judgement. The results clearly indicated not only complex interactions between the different ecosystem processes but also trade-offs between the ecosystem services. Climate change was predicted to have both positive and negative effects on key ecosystem services in Finnish conditions, the results being sector-specific and scenario-specific. Provisioning services like food and timber production would largely benefit from increasing temperatures. and prolongation of the growing season in the cool Finnish conditions (with e.g. estimated increases in growth rates of trees up to 80% and the introduction of a wider selection of crops), although increasing occurrence of factors such as fungal diseases and insect outbreaks were estimated to cause increasing risks. On the other hand, climate change was predicted to pose a major threat to several endangered and valuable species, water and air quality, and tourism services dependent on present climate conditions. Goal conflicts between maximising service production and meeting environmental quality objectives were also identified. Adaptation options and impact thresholds identified together with local enterprises and experts are presented.

AB  - Many ecosystem services are in decline. Local ecological knowledge and associated practice are essential to sustain and enhance ecosystem services on the ground. Here, we focus on social or collective memory in relation to management practice that sustains ecosystem services, and investigate where and how ecological practices, knowledge and experience are retained and transmitted. We analyze such social-ecological memory of allotment gardens in the Stockholm urban area, Sweden. Allotment gardens support ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal and pest regulation in the broader urban landscape. Surveys and interviews were preformed over a four-year period with several hundreds of gardeners. We found that the allotment gardens function as communities-of-practice, where participation and reification interact and social-ecological memory is a shared source of resilience of the community by being both emergent and persistent. Ecological practices and knowledge in allotment gardens are retained and transmitted by imitation of practices, oral communication and collective rituals and habits, as well as by the physical gardens, artifacts, metaphors and rules-in-use (institutions). Finally, a wider social context provides external support through various forms of media, markets, social networks, collaborative organizations, and legal structures. We exemplify the role of urban gardens in generating ecosystem services in times of crisis and change and conclude that stewards of urban green areas and the social memory that they carry may help counteract further decline of critical ecosystem services.

AB  - Among wealthy countries, increasing imports of natural resources to allow for unchecked consumption and greater domestic environmental conservation has become commonplace. This practice can negatively affect biodiversity conservation planning if natural resource harvest is merely pushed across political borders. As an example, we focus on the boreal forest ecosystem of Finland and northwest Russia. While the majority of protected forests are in northern Finland, the majority of biodiversity is in southern Finland, where protection is more difficult due to high private ownership, and the effectiveness of functioning conservation networks is more uncertain due to a longer history of land use. In northwest Russia, the current protected areas are inadequate to preserve most of the region's naturally dynamic and old growth forests. Increased importation of wood from northwest Russia to Finland may jeopardize the long-term viability of species in high diversity conservation areas in both Russia and Finland, through isolating conservation areas and lowering the age of the surrounding forest mosaic. The boreal forest ecosystem of Fennoscandia and northwest Russia would thus be best conserved by a large scale, coordinated conservation strategy that addresses long-term conservation goals and wood consumption, forest industries, logging practices and trade.

AB  - Organic soil amendments such as manure, biochar and compost are among the most efficient and widely used methods to increase soil carbon sequestration in agricultural soils. Even though their benefits are well known, many wood-derived materials are not yet utilized in Nordic agriculture due to a lack of incentives and knowledge of their effects in the local climate. We studied greenhouse gas exchange, plant growth and soil properties of a clay soil cultivated with oat in southern Finland in an extremely dry year. Two years earlier, the field was treated with three ligneous soil amendments-lime-stabilized fiber from the pulp industry, willow biochar and spruce biochar-which we compared against fertilized and non-fertilized controls. We found that the soil amendments increased porosity and the mean soil water holding capacity, which was most noticeable in plots amended with spruce biochar. There was a trend indicating that the mean yield and overall biomass production were larger in plots with soil amendments; however, the difference to unamended control was seldom significant due to the high variance among replicates. Manual chamber measurements revealed that carbon dioxide and methane exchange rates were reduced most probably by the exceptionally hot and dry weather conditions, but no differences could be found between the amended and unamended treatments. The nitrous oxide emissions were significantly smaller from the vegetated soil amended with willow biochar compared with the unamended control. Emissions from non-vegetated soil, representing heterotrophic respiration, were similar but without significant differences between treatments. Overall, the studied soil amendments indicated positive climatic impact two years after their application, but further research is needed to conclusively characterize the specific effects of organic soil amendments on processes affecting greenhouse gas exchange and plant growth.

AB  - The pressure to increase forest and land carbon stocks simultaneously with increasing forest based biomass harvest for energy and materials emphasizes the need for dedicated analyses of impacts and possible trade-offs between these different mitigation options including also forest related biophysical factors, surface albedo and the formation of biogenic Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA). We analyzed the change in global radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in these climatic agents as affected by the change in state of Finnish forests under increased or decreased harvest scenarios from a baseline. We also included avoided emissions due to wood material and energy substitution. Increasing harvests from baseline (65% of Current Annual Increment) decreased the total carbon sink (carbon in trees, soil and harvested wood products) at least for 50 years. When we coupled this change in carbon with other biosphere responses, surface albedo and aerosols, decreasing harvests from the baseline produced the largest cooling effect during 50 years. Accounting also for the avoided emissions due to increased wood use, the RF responses of the two lowest harvest scenarios were within uncertainty range. Our results show that the effects of forest management on SOA formation should be included in the analyses trying to deduce the net climate impact of forest use. The inclusion of the rarely considered SOA effects enforces the view that the lower the harvest, the more climatic cooling boreal forests provide. These results should act as a caution mark for policy makers who are emphasizing the increased utilization of forest biomass for short-living products and bioenergy as an efficient measure to mitigate climate change.

AB  - Thawing permafrost promotes microbial degradation of cryo-sequestered and new carbon leading to the biogenic production of methane creating a positive feedback to climate change. Here we determine microbial community composition along a permafrost thaw gradient in northern Sweden. Partially thawed sites were frequently dominated by a single archaeal phylotype Candidatus 'Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis' gen. nov. sp. nov. belonging to the uncultivated lineage 'Rice Cluster II' (Candidatus 'Methanoflorentaceae' fam. nov.). Metagenomic sequencing led to the recovery of its near-complete genome revealing the genes necessary for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. These genes are highly expressed and methane carbon isotope data are consistent with hydrogenotrophic production of methane in the partially thawed site. In addition to permafrost wetlands 'Methanoflorentaceae' are widespread in high methane-flux habitats suggesting that this lineage is both prevalent and a major contributor to global methane production. In thawing permafrost Candidatus 'M. stordalenmirensis' appears to be a key mediator of methane-based positive feedback to climate warming.

AB  - Boreal forests are important global carbon (C) sinks and, therefore, considered as a key element in climate change mitigation policies. However, their actual C sink strength is uncertain and under debate, particularly for the actively managed forests in the boreal regions of Fennoscandia. In this study, we use an extensive set of biometric- and chamber-based C flux data collected in 50 forest stands (ranging from 5 to 211 years) over 3 years (2016-2018) with the aim to explore the variations of the annual net ecosystem production (NEP; i.e., the ecosystem C balance) across a 68 km(2) managed boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. Our results demonstrate that net primary production rather than heterotrophic respiration regulated the spatio-temporal variations of NEP across the heterogeneous mosaic of the managed boreal forest landscape. We further find divergent successional patterns of NEP in our managed forests relative to naturally regenerating boreal forests, including (i) a fast recovery of the C sink function within the first decade after harvest due to the rapid establishment of a productive understory layer and (ii) a sustained C sink in old stands (131-211 years). We estimate that the rotation period for optimum C sequestration extends to 138 years, which over multiple rotations results in a long-term C sequestration rate of 86.5 t C ha(-1) per rotation. Our study highlights the potential of forest management to maximize C sequestration of boreal forest landscapes and associate climate change mitigation effects by developing strategies that optimize tree biomass production rather than heterotrophic soil C emissions.

AB  - A better understanding of the potential cumulative impacts of large-scale fish farming, could help marine aquaculture to become more environmentally sustainable. Risk assessment plays an important role in this process by elucidating the main challenges and associated risk factors. An appropriate aquaculture risk assessment should contribute to mutual risk understanding and risk acknowledgement among stakeholders, and thus common perspectives on measures and governance. In this paper, we describe an approach to risk assessment in marine aquaculture that aims to promote fruitful discussions about risk and risk-influencing factors across stakeholders with different value perceptions. We elaborate on the concept of risk and risk terminology and conclude that new aquaculture risk assessment methodology should be guided by risk science. The suggested methodology is based on the latest thinking in risk science and has been tested in a thorough study of environmental risk related to Norwegian aquaculture. The study shows that the new methodical approach has an immanent pedagogical potential and contributes to strengthening risk understanding and risk acknowledgement among stakeholders. In conclusion, the suggested risk assessment methodology has proved a valuable tool for marine scientists in analyzing, evaluating, and communicating environmental risk.

AB  - This review focuses on the current status of antibiotics use, effects on animal health and the environment, existing policies and regulatory mechanisms in the top 15 producing countries. Fifty papers were reviewed and represented the bulk of literature worldwide. We observed that 67 antibiotic compounds were used in 11 of the 15 countries between 2008 and 2018. Among these countries, 73% applied oxytetracycline, sulphadiazine and florfenicol. On average, countries used 15 antibiotics and the top users included Vietnam (39), China (33) and Bangladesh (21). On environmental and health risks, the review revealed sufficient evidence that directly links antibiotics use to food safety, occupational health hazards and antimicrobial resistance. Environmental risks included residue accumulation, aquatic biodiversity toxicity, microbial community selection for antibiotic resistance and the emergence of multi-antibacterial resistant strains. Regarding policies, major players were the European Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Codex and government ministries. In particular, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and Norwegian Veterinary Institute demonstrated the most outstanding regulation mechanisms of antibiotics use in aquaculture that needs to be emulated. The future of aquaculture lies in guaranteeing the supply of safe aquatic products to the growing consumer market. Thus, international coordination of the policy and regulatory environment is needed, while increased investment in research for alternative aquatic health management strategies is essential. Future technologies should focus on the reduction of antibiotics use to safeguard the environment and ensure safety of consumers, feed industry and aquaculture workers.

AB  - Measuring turbulent fluxes with the eddy covariance method has become a widely accepted and powerful tool for the determination of long term data sets for the exchange of momentum, sensible and latent heat, and trace gases such as CO2 between the atmosphere and the underlying surface. Several flux networks developed continuous measurements above complex terrain, e.g. AmeriFlUx and EUROFLUX, with a strong focus on the net exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the underlying surface. Under many conditions basic assumptions for the eddy covariance method in its simplified form, such as stationarity of the flow, homogeneity of the surface and fully developed turbulence of the flow field, are not fulfilled. To deal with non-ideal conditions which are common at many FLUXNET sites, quality tests have been developed to check if these basic theoretical assumptions are valid.
   In the framework of the CARBOEUROFLUX project, we combined quality tests described by Foken and Wichura (1996) with the analytical footprint model of Schmid (1997). The aim was to identify suitable wind sectors and meteorological conditions for flux measurements. These tools were used on data of 18 participating sites. Quality tests were applied on the fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat, and on the CO2-flux, respectively. The influence of the topography on the vertical wind component was also checked. At many sites the land use around the flux towers is not homogeneous or the fetch may not be large enough. So the relative contribution of the land use type intended to be measured was also investigated. Thus the developed tool allows comparative investigations of the measured turbulent fluxes at different sites if using the same technique and algorithms for the determination of the fluxes as well as analyses of potential problems caused by influences of the surrounding land use patterns.

AB  - The great scallop Pecten maximus is harvested in several European countries and fisheries targeting this species are severely regulated by fishing quotas. In addition, hatchery-based population enhancement has been developed in some countries to provide alternative or complementary production. The genetic structure of wild populations of P. maximus and the potential impact of aquaculture on the genetic diversity of this species remains poorly documented. In this study, we explored the genetic structure of P. maximus using 12 microsatellite markers, considering 14 populations sampled from Galicia (Spain) to the North of Norway, and one population of Pecten jacobaeus (L., 1758) from the Lion Gulf (Mediterranean Sea). Results indicated a clear differentiation between Norwegian and Atlantic (from Ireland to Spain) populations, but very little to no difference between populations within these two groups. A decrease of the genetic diversity was observed with latitude. No significant reduction of the genetic diversity was observed in the Bay of Brest, where hatchery-based population enhancement has been performed intensively since 1983. Our results are discussed in the light of the inferred recent evolutionary history, phylogeography and connectivity of populations in Europe, and of the phenotypic variability reported in previous studies between northern and southern populations.

AB  - Long time series are important because they extend back to an era when animal populations were less influenced by habitat loss and climate change. Annual fluctuations in harvest yields are good proxies for large changes in population size and may reveal underlying ecological processes. From a variety of sources, we built a 142-year long time series representing the mean daily catch (CPUE) of willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in southeastern Norway. CPUE decreased over the 142 years, from approximately 35 birds shot per day in early years to around two in the last years. There were three periods in the time series: a first period with 3-5 year cycles of high peaks and low troughs (1872-1900), a short second period with similarly high peaks, variable depth of troughs and variable cyclicity (1901-1916), and a third long period with much lower peaks and faded cycles (1917-2013). Yearly variation in CPUE was best explained by an interacting effect of small rodent peak years and period, with a reduced positive effect of rodents in the last period, and a positive effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation index in spring and early summer. None of the weather variables with significant time trends explained any variation in CPUE and we could therefore not attribute the decline in CPUE directly to climate change. We postulate that a long-term dampening of the amplitude in small rodent cycles combined with an increase in red fox numbers, have increased predation on alternative prey like ptarmigan, and prevented the populations from reaching their earlier peaks. Even though the present population of willow ptarmigan is only a fraction of what it was in former days, we recommend light hunting to motivate for monitoring and to keep public attention on the bird.

AB  - Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity (beta sim, beta Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.

AB  - We present a framework for evaluating and communicating effects of human activity on water quality in managed forests. The framework is based on the following processes: atmospheric deposition, weathering, accumulation, recirculation and flux. Impairments to water quality are characterized in terms of their extent, longevity and frequency. Impacts are communicated using a "traffic lights" metaphor for characterizing severity of water quality impairments arising from forestry and other anthropogenic pressures. The most serious impairments to water quality in managed boreal forests include (i) forestry activities causing excessive sediment mobilization and extirpation of aquatic species and (ii) other anthropogenic pressures caused by long-range transport of mercury and acidifying pollutants. The framework and tool presented here can help evaluate, summarize and communicate the most important issues in circumstances where land management and other anthropogenic pressures combine to impair water quality and may also assist in implementing the "polluter pays" principle.

AB  - Background: Forest ecosystems are increasingly seen as multi-functional production systems, which should provide, besides timber and economic benefits, also other ecosystem services related to biological diversity, recreational uses and environmental functions of forests. This study analyzed the performance of even-aged rotation forest management (RFM), continuous cover forestry (CCF) and any-aged forestry (AAF) in the production of ecosystem services. AAF allows both even-aged and uneven-aged management schedules. The ecosystem services included in the analyses were net present value, volume of harvested timber, cowberry and bilberry yields, scenic value of the forest, carbon balance and suitability of the forest to Siberian jay.
   Methods: Data envelopment analysis was used to derive numerical efficiency ratios for the three management systems. Efficiency ratio is the sum of weighted outputs (ecosystem services) divided by the sum of weighted inputs. The linear programing model proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes was used to derive the weights for calculating efficiency scores for the silvicultural systems.
   Results and conclusions: CCF provided more ecosystem services than RFM, and CCF was more efficient than RFM and AAF in the production of ecosystem services. Multi-objective management provided more ecosystem services (except harvested timber) than single-objective management that maximized economic profitability. The use of low discount rate (resulting in low cutting level and high growing stock volume) led to better supply of most ecosystems services than the use of high discount rate. RFM where NPV was maximized with high discount rate led to particularly poor provision of most ecosystem services. In CCF the provision of ecosystem services was less sensitive to changes in discount rate and management objective than in RFM.

AB  - The ecosystem service concept is recognized as a useful tool to support sustainability in decision-making. In this study, we collaborated with actors in the Helge a catchment, southern Sweden, in an iterative participatory ecosystem service assessment. Through workshops and interviews, we jointly decided which ecosystem services to assess and indicators to use in order to achieve a sense of ownership and a higher legitimacy of the assessment. Subsequently, we explored the landscape-level interactions between the 15 assessed services, and found that the area can be described using three distinct ecosystem service bundles. The iterative, participatory process strengthened our analysis and created a shared understanding and overview of the multifunctional landscape around Helge a among participants. Importantly, this allowed for the generated knowledge to impact local strategic sustainability planning. With this study, we illustrate how similar processes can support local decision-making for a more sustainable future.

AB  - In this study, we assess how representative a single charcoal record from a peat profile in small bogs (1.5-2 ha in area) is for the reconstruction of Holocene fire history. We use high-resolution macrocharcoal (>250 mu m) analysis of continuous series of 2 cm(3)samples from two small bogs in southern Sweden. We compare (1) duplicate charcoal records from the same core, (2) duplicate charcoal records from profiles in the same site (10 m apart), and (3) charcoal records from two sites within the same region (15 km apart). Comparisons are made for charcoal counts and area expressed as accumulation rates. The results suggest that (a) charcoal counts and area are highly correlated in all records; (b) duplicate charcoal records within the same core are very similar, although some charcoal peaks are found in only one of the two records; (c) although long-term trends in fire regimes are similar between duplicate charcoal records from nearby profiles within the same site and between charcoal records from sites within the same region, some individual charcoal peaks/fire events are asynchronous between records. The known historical fires of the town of Vaxjo (1570 and 1612 CE) are recorded at the two study sites, which indicates a macrocharcoal source area of minimum 15 km in diameter. The 2 cm(3)peat samples contained relatively low amounts of macrocharcoal; we therefore recommend to analyse larger samples from small peat bogs with comparable peat accumulation rates. This will improve the reliability of the macrocharcoal record and its interpretation.

AB  - 1 If, within a vegetation type, fire regimes are climate dependent, then fire patterns should be synchronous at regional scales. If they are not synchronous, then fires may be dependent on local processes such as human-induced disturbances.
   2 Two fire chronologies were developed using 34-radiocarbon dating measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) from wood charcoal buried in soil. These charcoal fragments were sampled in two study sites 10 km apart in the Maurienne valley (Southern Vanoise massif, Savoy, France).
   3 Asynchronous temporal fire patterns were seen at Aussois and Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne. This demonstrates the dependence of fires on local- or stand-scale environmental forcing; any direct relationship with climate is therefore rejected.
   4 Slash-and-burn practices are probably the main source of Holocene fires in the Maurienne valley. However, deforestation did not occur throughout a site in any period, nor simultaneously at the same elevation in two different sites 10 km apart. The cultural landscape was shaped as early as the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, between 6000 and 3000 sp.
   5 Deforestation at both study sites probably occurred in many stages in many small areas. The fire intervals were c. 500-1000 years. Deforested areas increased in extent over 2000-4000 years, until the present-day cultural landscape was established. This process stopped c. 2500 sp at Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne but is still active at Aussois.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) is a valuable concept to be used in the planning and management of social-ecological landscapes. However, the understanding of the determinant factors affecting the interaction between services in the form of synergies or trade-offs is still limited. We assessed the production of 16 ES across 62 municipalities in the Norrstrom drainage basin in Sweden. We combined GIS data with publically available information for quantifying and mapping the distribution of services. Additionally, we calculated the diversity of ES for each municipality and used correlations and k-means clustering analyses to assess the existence of ES bundles. We found five distinct types of bundles of ES spatially agglomerated in the landscape that could be explained by regional social and ecological gradients. Human-dominated landscapes were highly multifunctional in our study area and urban densely populated areas were hotspots of cultural services.

AB  - Multifunctionality is a critical objective in forest management planning. Water related ecosystem services are only sparsely implemented in Forest Management Models (FMM) although water scarcity is highly relevant. This study proposes an approach to integrate groundwater recharge into a FMM. The approach is based on knowledge transfer between two different forest growth models. For site-specific simulations on the landscape level, observation-based models require functions that describe groundwater recharge in a non-mechanistic way. However, groundwater recharge is difficult to measure and strongly depends on environmental conditions. Thus, we calibrated the observation-based FMM site-specific for two different case study areas, using a process-based forest growth model and substitute empiricism. Relations between forest structure and groundwater recharge were derived with multiple linear regressions and included in a FMM. The groundwater recharge was remarkably influenced by tree species and stand structure at both sites. The approach simulates groundwater recharge plausibly depending on site conditions and stand management on landscape level. Groundwater recharge was between 30-50% of the occurring precipitation and higher within broadleaved stands. Exemplary simulation of a European beech - Norway spruce mixed forest stand reveals a trade-off between groundwater recharge and stand volume growth depending on forest management.

AB  - Sweden is one of the largest exporters of pulp and paper products in the world. It follows that huge quantities of sludge rich in carbonaceous organic material and containing heavy metals are generated. This paper carried out a comparative environmental analysis of three different technologies, which can be adopted to produce biochar and recover energy from the biosludge, using landfilling as the reference case. These three thermochemical biosludge management systems-using incineration, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC)-were modeled using life cycle assessment (LCA). Heat generated in the incineration process (System A) was considered to be for captive consumption within the kraft pulp mills. It was assumed that the biochars-pyrochar and hydrochar-produced from pyrolysis (System B) and HTC (System C), respectively, were added to the forest soils. The LCA results show that all the alternative systems considerably improve the environmental performance of biosludge management, relative to landfilling. For all systems, there are net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (-0.89, -1.43, and -1.13 tonnes CO2-equivalent per tonne dry matter biosludge in Systems A, B, and C, respectively). System B resulted in the lowest potential eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity impacts, whereas System C had the least acidification potential. The results of this analysis show that, from an environmental point of view, biochar soil amendment as an alternative method for handling pulp and paper mill biosludge is preferable to energy recovery. However, an optimal biochar system needs to factor in the social and economic contexts as well.

AB  - A significant expansion of offshore windpower is expected ill northwestern Europe in the near future. Little is known about the impacts it may have on the marine environment. Here, we investigate the potential for wind turbines to function as artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices (FADs), i.e., whether they would locally increase fish densities or alter fish assemblages. Fish communities and habitat composition were investigated using visual transects at two windpower farms off the southeastern coast of Sweden. central Baltic Sea. Fish abundance was greater in the vicinity of the turbines than in surrounding areas, while species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') were similar. On the monopiles of the turbines, fish community structure was different, and total fish abundance was greater. while species richness and diversity (H') were lower than oil the surrounding seabed. Blue mussels and barnacles covered most of the submerged parts of the turbines. Oil the seabed. more blue mussels and a lesser cover of red algae were recorded around the power plants than elsewhere. Results from this study suggest that offshore windfarms may function as combined artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices for small demersal fish.

AB  - Research to date on urban ecosystem services has mainly been conducted in large cities, particularly in China, the USA and some European countries. This study examined the provision of urban ecosystem services in a Swedish municipality context, based on interviews with municipal stakeholders in strategic management and planning from six municipalities and a review of existing publications readily available to practitioners. The analysis focused on (1) the ecosystem services explicitly covered, (2) whether multifunctionality was covered and specific synergies and trade-offs identified and, (3) the spatial scale and context used for ecosystem services (valuation/mapping, planning, design or maintenance) in practical application. The results showed that regulatory services are very much the focus in municipal operations as well as in publications available to practitioners. This is reflected in the implementation of the concept through problem solving often related to regulatory services, using multifunctionality and win-win situations in ecosystem service supply. These findings contribute to the growing body of work exploring how the concept of ecosystem services is adapted and utilised in practice.

AB  - An international overview of the extent and type of ecological restoration can offer new perspectives for understanding, planning, and implementation. The Nordic countries, with a great range of natural conditions but historically similar social and political structures, provide an opportunity to compare restoration approaches and efforts across borders. The aim of this study was to explore variation in ecological restoration using the Nordic countries as an example. We used recent national assessments and expert evaluations of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts differed among countries: forest and peatland restoration was most common in Finland, freshwater restoration was most common in Sweden, restoration of natural heathlands and grasslands was most common in Iceland, restoration of natural and semi-cultural heathlands was most common in Norway, and restoration of cultural ecosystems, mainly abandoned agricultural land, was most common in Denmark. Ecological restoration currently does not occur on the Faroe Islands. Economic incentives influence ecological restoration and depend on laws and policies in each country. Our analyses suggest that habitat types determine the methods of ecological restoration, whereas socio-economic drivers are more important for the decisions concerning the timing and location of restoration. To improve the understanding, planning, and implementation of ecological restoration, we advocate increased cooperation and knowledge sharing across disciplines and among countries, both in the Nordic countries and internationally. An obvious advantage of such cooperation is that a wider range of experiences from different habitats and different socio-economic conditions becomes available and thus provides a more solid basis for developing practical solutions for restoration methods and policies.

AB  - Natural disturbances change forest habitat quality for many species. As the extent and intensity of natural disturbances may increase under climate change, it is unclear how this increase can affect habitat quality on different spatial scales. To support management tools and policies aiming to prevent habitat loss, we studied how habitat quality develops in the long run depending on the disturbance severity using a space-for-time substitution approach. We explored the effects of time since disturbance (0-250 years) and disturbance severity (20%-100% canopy removal) on structure-based habitat quality indicators in European primary Norway spruce Picea abies forests using 1000 m(2) circular plots in hierarchical design (a total of 407 plots in 35 stands). Disturbance history was reconstructed from tree cores. Habitat quality indicators were modelled as a function of the severity of the most severe disturbance and the time since this disturbance. We hypothesised that high within-stand habitat heterogeneity is formed by different successional stages after disturbances of various intensities. The results showed a U-shaped response of habitat quality to post-disturbance habitat succession on the plot scale. The decline deepened with disturbance severity. The U-shape response occurred in: large tree occurrence, amount of standing and lying deadwood, diversity of understory and understory openness. The spatial diversity in disturbance parameters increased spatial diversity of habitat quality on a stand level as expected. This high within-stand habitat heterogeneity also decreased with increasing age of the most recent disturbance. This suggests that the absence of young successional stages results in the absence of some important elements for biodiversity, for example sun-exposed snags. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that currently intensifying natural disturbance regime can consequently result in a lower habitat heterogeneity. In managed spruce forests after natural disturbances, we recommend at least the partial retention of biological legacies to preserve habitat heterogeneity and to avoid uniform and dense plantations resulting in a greater homogenisation. To emulate the natural disturbances pattern, spruce forests should be managed with a wide range of harvested patches of the size limited by a local natural disturbance regime creating spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - Ecosystem services have been under intensive research and policy interest during the past two decades, resulting in advanced theoretical understanding and a variety of innovative policies. However, as economic approaches to ecosystem services are gaining foothold, co-creation of ecosystem services through entrepreneurial activity has been almost totally neglected in scientific discourse. By focusing on recent developments in the forests of Finland and Peru, we show how forest ecosystem service entrepreneurs are introducing new ecosystem service-related livelihood initiatives, business models and economic mechanisms. Scientists and policy-makers are showing a growing interest in how these bottom-up initiatives actually happen and what it takes to create new socioecological opportunities. The new discourse is critical toward the habit of mind to see a wide ontological and epistemological gap between the use and protection of ecosystems as well as between the abstracted practices of many ecosystem service approaches and particular forest use practices.

AB  - Trees are promoters of forest ecosystems and tree species differ in their manners of shaping the habitat conditions on reclaimed areas. We compared effects of pure forest stands of Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, and Pinus sylvestris (age 20-31 years) planted on sandy, loamy sand, sandy loam, and loam soils, on chemical properties of the soil and vascular plants species composition of the herb layer. Studied properties were assessed in pairs of plots located less than 50 m apart, that differed in species composition of the canopy but were characterized by similar abiotic conditions. Forest stands of A. glutinosa were distinguished by a higher SOC content in soil (2.3% vs. 1.4% under B. pendula and P. sylvestris), higher contribution of species typical for fertile forest edges (11.4 species vs. 5.9 species on average under B. pendula and P. sylvestris) and lower number of species of the family Fabaceae (1.5 species vs. 5.2 species on average under B. pendula and P. sylvestris). Effects of P. sylvestris stands depended on soil texture. On soils with more than 15% of silt and clay, generally, no effects were observed. However, on sandy soils (more than 85% of sand) we reported lower soil reaction (pH 6.3 in aqueous solution vs. 7.3 under B. pendula) and smaller number of plant species (17 vs. 28 on average under B. pendula). Our results showed that the tree species used for afforestation significantly influenced the characteristics of the forest ecosystems, even more than abiotic conditions.

AB  - In Finland municipal and industrial waste water purification has effectively decreased nutrient emissions from point sources leading to improved water quality. No clear effects of decreasing non-point loading (atmospheric deposition, agriculture, forestry) are found, however, and nitrate concentrations are increasing in some rivers. The aim of this study was to determine the origin and timing of inorganic nitrogen loading to the Simojoki using the dynamic, semi-distributed INCA-N model. The simulation results showed that, at the river outlet, only about half of the inorganic nitrogen load originated from anthropogenic sources. The inorganic nitrogen load largely depended on runoff and half of the annual load was centred around the snowmelt period in April-May. There was a risk of increasing nitrogen load due to changes in agricultural land use. Water protection measures at all diffuse sources could decrease the anthropogenic part of the inorganic N load to the sea, but individual measures would only result in small reductions.

AB  - The transition of the ecosystem service framework from academic discourse into practical land use management and policy guidance is in the making. Planners and decision makers seek spatial valuation data, comprehensive examples of which are few or hindered by sectoral research traditions. We present a case of linking land use to multimethod spatial ecosystem service valuation aiming at comprehensiveness and commensurability, based on a project run parallel to regional land-use planning in the Tampere region, Finland. A spectrum of ecosystem services was scrutinized, the annual value of which was estimated at ?0.8-lB. Compared to land-use planning, core areas of ecological networks proved relatively poor in terms of valuation, but hot-spots of human-nature interaction such as recreational, groundwater and landscape areas immensely valuable. Strong urban-rural trends in ecosystem service value were found, emphasizing the importance of urban nature and the context-specificity of natural capital discourse. We argue that some mismatches exist between the ecosystem service framework and its practical applicability, and that the main problem is not necessarily the transferability of tools and indicators, but the transfer of valuation and the assumptions and choices behind it. Notwithstanding its problems, the applied framework proved valuable in evaluating and guiding future land use.

AB  - Animal personality traits and the emergence of behavioural syndromes, i.e. between-individual correlation of behaviours, are commonly quantified from behavioural observations in controlled environments. Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is, however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46 adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness: diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed model revealed significant positive correlations between travel distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an activity-exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were uncorrelated with the activity-exploration syndrome and with each other, albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours. We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - While aquaculture production in a number of countries has been highly successful in terms of production growth, there is also a number of instances where the rapid growth has been curtailed due to sustainability challenges. In response, fostering sustainable aquaculture production has become a key policy and research agenda. The point of departure for this paper is the radical technological innovations based sustainable restructuring dynamics of the Norwegian salmon farming industry, which despite becoming one of the most profitable aquaculture in-dustries in the world, has in recent years seen its growth curtailed due to sustainability challenges. To address these challenges and to enable the use of new areas currently inaccessible by the incumbent aquaculture tech-nology, the Norwegian authorities launched in 2015 a new type of innovation policy instrument, known as development licences. Based on a mapping of the aquaculture production technology development projects as well as in-depth interviews, this paper elucidates how the targeted innovation policy instrument has instigated the sustainable restructuring process of the Norwegian aquaculture industry. Our findings indicate that in the short term, the innovation policy appears to have succeeded in the reconfiguration, and more precisely, the 'renewal' process of the aquaculture production technology innovation networks (ecosystems) thanks to the entry of the new capable actors into the segment. However, we emphasise that the overall success of the innovation policy instrument will ultimately hinge upon sufficiently addressing certain aspects of the institutional failures in the sector.

AB  - Fire regimes and herbivore densities have in parts of the boreal been heavily impacted by human activities with consequences for vegetation, forage supply and ungulate use. In this study, we evaluate the effects of natural wildfires and prescribed burning on moose forage availability, use, and browsing in northern Sweden. We studied three wildfire locations, adjacent controls, and five prescribed burns 12 years after fire. To compare forage availability and browsing levels we combined related variables with Principal Component Analyses and used the first axis in a regression analysis. The wildfire locations had a different composition of forage compared with the controls with less forage in the field layer and more woody browse and deciduous saplings. Forage availability was best explained by the occurrence of fire and differed between wildfire and the unburned control areas. Browsing levels were higher in wildfire locations compared with unburned controls. Prescribed burns varied substantially and could resemble both unburnt control and wildfire in terms of forage availability and browsing. We conclude that prescribed burning as a restoration action potentially can improve forage availability, particularly of deciduous species, if they mimic the impact of wildfires in terms of larger area burned and high fire severity.

AB  - AimThe relative contribution of community functional diversity and composition to ecosystem functioning is a critical question in ecology in order to enable better predictions of how ecosystems may respond to a changing climate. However, there is little consensus about which modes of functional biodiversity are most important for tree growth at large spatial scales. Here we assessed the relative importance of climate, functional diversity and functional identity (i.e. the community mean values of four key functional traits) for tree growth across the European continent, spanning the northern boreal to the southern Mediterranean forests.
   LocationFinland, Germany, Sweden, Spain and Wallonia (Belgium).
   MethodsUsing data from five European national forest inventories we applied a hierarchical linear model to estimate the sensitivity of tree growth to changes in climate, functional diversity and functional identity along a latitudinal gradient.
   ResultsFunctional diversity was weakly related to tree growth in the temperate and boreal regions and more strongly in the Mediterranean region. In the temperate region, where climate was the most important predictor, functional diversity and identity had a similar importance for tree growth. Functional identity was strongest at the latitudinal extremes of the continent, largely driven by strong changes in the importance of maximum height along the latitudinal gradient.
   Main conclusionsFunctional diversity is an important driver of tree growth in the Mediterranean region, providing evidence that niche complementarity may be more important for tree growth in water-limited forests. The strong influence of functional identity at the latitudinal extremes indicates the importance of a particular trait composition for tree growth in harsh climates. Furthermore, we speculate that this functional identity signal may reflect a trait-based differentiation of successional stages rather than abiotic filtering due to water or energy limitation.

AB  - Urbanization effects on vegetation and the alteration in land use is likely to be the major driver of fragmentation and the loss of ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity. Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect ESS. However, due to the high complexity of urban systems, ecological connectivity assessment in urban planning remains challenging. This article evaluates policy documents and tools for ESS assessment in Stockholm, Sweden. Stockholm is an interesting city for studying ESS planning and management since Sweden has a long tradition of formal policy for biodiversity management. An overview is presented of tools and approaches to measure ESS at different scale levels used in the urban planning process in Stockholm. Their application illustrates the complementary nature of these tools, but also the need to integrate them in a platform based on a GIS (Geographic Information System) model. Ultimately, the development of such an integrated tool should inform and support planning practice in guiding urban systems towards greater sustainability.

AB  - Aim of study: Thinning experiments in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands have been carried out for many years in different regions of its distribution. The aim of this paper is to gather knowledge regarding the effects of thinning on Scots pine stands, from the effects on growth and yield to the provision of ecosystem services in the context of climate change.
   Area of study: The review covers studies from different regions of the distribution area of Scots pine
   Material and methods: We reviewed the effect of thinning on four aspects: growth and yield, stability against snow and wind, response to drought, and ecosystem services.
   Main results: Heavy thinning involves a loss in volume yield, although the magnitude depends on the region, site and stand age. Thinning generally does not affect dominant height while the positive effect on tree diameter depends on the thinning regime. The stability of the stand against snow and wind is lower after the first thinning and increases in the long term. The impact of extreme droughts on tree growth is lower in thinned stands, which is linked to a better capacity to recover after the drought. Thinning generally reduces the wood quality, litter mass, and stand structural diversity, while having neutral or positive effects on other ecosystem services, although these effects can vary depending on the thinning regime. However, scarce information is available for most of the ecosystem services.
   Research highlights: Existing thinning experiments in Scots pine stands provided valuable information about thinning effects, but new experiments which cover a broad range of ecosystem services under different site conditions are still needed.

AB  - In this study in Sweden, six small (<50 ha) and six large farms (>135 ha) participated. The aims of the study were to a) measure differences between small and large farms regarding on-farm landscape heterogeneity, and b) evaluate relations between on-farm landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity, measured as numbers of breeding bird species, bird territories, butterflies, bumblebees, and herbaceous plant species. Sample area of the same size, placed on each farm, was used for the biodiversity assessments and on-farm landscape heterogeneity studies. On-farm landscape heterogeneity was classified with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Linear regression was applied to analyze relationships between on-farm landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity indicators. Multivariate regression was used to analyze relations between single bird species and specific on-farm habitats. Small farms had significantly higher on-farm landscape heterogeneity than large farms. Strong positive relations between on-farm landscape heterogeneity and number of breeding birds, butterflies, and herbaceous plant species were found. Total on-farm landscape heterogeneity seems to be more important for bird diversity than do specific landscape elements. The study indicates that, to increase biodiversity, farm size should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Arctic environmental change induces shifts in high-latitude plant community composition and stature with implications for Arctic carbon cycling and energy exchange. Two major components of change in high-latitude ecosystems are the advancement of trees into tundra and the increased abundance and size of shrubs. How future changes in key climatic and environmental drivers will affect distributions of major ecosystem types is an active area of research. Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) offer a way to investigate multiple and interacting drivers of vegetation distribution and ecosystem function. We employed the LPJ-GUESS tree-individual-based DVM over the Tornetrask area, a subarctic landscape in northern Sweden. Using a highly resolved climate dataset to downscale CMIP5 climate data from three global climate models and two 21st-century future scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), we investigated future impacts of climate change on these ecosystems. We also performed model experiments where we factorially varied drivers (climate, nitrogen deposition and [CO2]) to disentangle the effects of each on ecosystem properties and functions. Our model predicted that treelines could advance by between 45 and 195 elevational metres by 2100, depending on the scenario. Temperature was a strong driver of vegetation change, with nitrogen availability identified as an important modulator of treeline advance. While increased CO2 fertilisation drove productivity increases, it did not result in range shifts of trees. Treeline advance was realistically simulated without any temperature dependence on growth, but biomass was overestimated. Our finding that nitrogen cycling could modu-late treeline advance underlines the importance of representing plant-soil interactions in models to project future Arctic vegetation change.

AB  - Background Increasing the use of forest harvest residues for bioenergy production reduces greenhouse emissions from the use of fossil fuels. However, it may also reduce carbon stocks and habitats for deadwood dependent species. Consequently, simple tools for assessing the trade-offs of alternative management practices on forest dynamics and their services to people are needed. The objectives of this study were to combine mapping and simulation modelling to investigate the effects of forest management on ecosystem services related to carbon cycle in the case of bioenergy production; and to evaluate the suitability of this approach for assessing ecosystem services at the landscape level. Stand level simulations of forest growth and carbon budget were combined with extensive multi-source forest inventory data across a southern boreal landscape in Finland. Stochastic changes in the stand age class distribution over the study region were simulated to mimic variation in management regimes. Results The mapping framework produced reasonable estimates of the effects of forest management on a set of key ecosystem service indicators: the annual carbon stocks and fluxes of forest biomass and soil, timber and energy-wood production and the coarse woody litter production over a simulation period 2012-2100. Regular harvesting, affecting the stand age class distribution, was a key driver of the carbon stock changes at a landscape level. Extracting forest harvest residues in the final felling caused carbon loss from litter and soil, particularly with combined aboveground residue and stump harvesting. It also reduced the annual coarse woody litter production, demonstrating negative impacts on deadwood abundance and, consequently, forest biodiversity. Conclusions The refined mapping framework was suitable for assessing ecosystem services at the landscape level. The procedure contributes to bridging the gap between ecosystem service mapping and detailed simulation modelling in boreal forests. It allows for visualizing ecosystem services as fine resolution maps to support sustainable land use planning. In the future, more detailed models and a wider variety of ecosystem service indicators could be added to develop the method.

AB  - This study aims to explore the measurement of potential synergies between water management objectives and other ecosystem services generated by Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in the context of urban planning. The research also investigates the comparative benefits of two analytical methods, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and green area factor for districts (GAFD). The study employs Malmi district in Helsinki, Finland, as a case study, examining five distinct NBS scenarios with varying degrees of integration. The results affirm that NBS can indeed enhance ecosystem services provision and stormwater management. The comparative analysis of the two methods, reveals that scenarios with high green factors exhibit effective flood risk reduction, while those with low green factors struggle to manage water, emphasizing the importance of balancing green and built elements in urban planning for optimal flood risk reduction. Furthermore, the study underscores the advantages of the two methods: GAFD offers simplicity and lower expertise requirements, generating valuable insights into ecosystem services, while SWMM provides precise stormwater management data. The findings emphasize the significance of diverse NBS combinations that harness the multifunctional aspects of green infrastructure, highlighting the need for integrated urban planning. The utilization of GAFD analysis provides a comprehensive districtwide perspective in a flexible manner, thereby improving the comprehension of the interconnected nature of urban green spaces.

AB  - Data on birds occurring in farmland in the : Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were related to the spatial organisation of farmed habitats in three different agricultural landscape types. Species richness, abundance, and diversity of farmland bird communities, as well as abundance of the most frequently observed species were positively related to the number of residual non-cropped elements within farmland, the local mixture of annual crop and grass fields, and the variety of field types. The positive association of the species richness and abundance of the farmland bird community with richness in residual habitats and crops was most prominent in open landscapes. The results suggest that, by simplifying farmland structure and making: it more homogenous, EU agricultural policies will have a detrimental effect on farmland bird populations in Eastern Europe. Ways of better targeting of the agri-environment schemes are suggested. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of result-oriented agri-environmental measures (roAEM) to increase the effectiveness of standard action-based agri-environmental measures (AEMs) is generating increased interest in Europe. A number of examples of roAEMs are or have been tested and implemented in Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The implementation of roAEMs in German and French rural development programmes (RDPs) has shown that this approach is generally conforming to the current institutional framework of the second pillar of the CAP. The main objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework and guidelines for the implementation of roAEMs in Lithuania based on the lessons learnt from the existing result-oriented examples in other countries. Based on a review of 14 existing examples the paper discusses key dimensions and challenges to be considered in the development of a pilot scheme roAEMs in Lithuania. Existing evidence shows result-oriented payments are more targeted and deliver additional environmental benefits. Successful examples have started as simple result-oriented payments and build on existing AEMs by adding a result-oriented component to mainstream action-based AEMs. This suggests that the shift from action-based to result-oriented payments in Lithuania needs to be incremental, adding simple and comparably low risk result-oriented payments to existing action-based AEMs. Pilot schemes and trails are an important tool to test and validate developed indicators, payment levels and responses of participating farmers. There is a large amount of experience available to build on in designing trials and consequently a pilot scheme for Lithuania. A result-oriented component targeted at grassland biodiversity would be in line with the main agri-environmental objectives of the Lithuanian RDP and would address some of the existing key problems with the action-based grassland measure the Landscape Stewardship Scheme. The environmental targeting would be improved by linking the grassland payments to the desired biodiversity outcome and adding yearly monitoring of relevant biodiversity outcome indicators in relation to species diversity and abundance of plants, insects and birds (e.g. number of plant indicator species). The improved environmental targeting would also deliver a higher coverage of meadows with high biodiversity value.

AB  - Sustainable urban storm-water management is a key policy of the European Union. Increasing populations, densification and global climate change cause major challenges for the management of urban run-off waters. Small urban aquatic ecosystems (ponds, brooks, wetlands) are important, because they support human health and well-being through water regulation, mitigating urban run-off waters and providing recreational benefits. Ecosystem functions, which arise from interactions between biotic and abiotic processes and which benefit society, are called ecosystem services. The ecosystem service concept can be useful in estimating the impacts of land-use and resource management on ecosystem functions, and to support decision-making. However, many researchers claim that measuring or valuing ecosystem services in land-use planning may fail to recognize intangible or non-monetary values. We studied a local environmental conflict related to a storm-water management plan in Helsinki, Finland. By using integrated value mapping of ecosystem services, we assigned socio-cultural values of local blue-green infrastructure, and evaluated how these values could be taken into account at the early stage in green area planning. Stakeholders (locals, managers and politicians) expressed a total of 47 perceived values related to the urban brook and the public park. We divided these values into four types: (1) use and experience, (2) existence, (3) symbolic, and (4) bequest and moral. We show great differences between the meanings and values of locals, managers and politicians. Managers expressed negative values towards the park, while locals more commonly expressed symbolic values. Exhaustive value mapping could help to identify mutual values and understand disagreements between stakeholders. We introduced a model for a transdisciplinary adaptive planning by using integrated value mapping within ecosystem service concept. Often local protests towards development projects or the management of green areas are seen in a negative light by considering them as NIMBY. Instead of dismissing plurality of meanings and values that emerge from strong place identity, we call for the sustainable management of place-attached values as part of a techno-economic planning strategy of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Key message
   Under an outbreak scenario in a buffer zone of a protected area, bark beetle-caused tree mortality was modulated by earlier natural disturbances (wind and bark beetles), sanitary management and seasonal temperature. In buffer zones, the effects of sanitary management on tree mortality remained limited due to the migration of bark beetles from unmanaged areas.
   Context
   The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is regarded as an economically significant pest of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst). However, in protected areas, it is regarded as a keystone species for biodiversity. This results in two contrasting management strategies that meet in buffer zones of protected areas.
   Aims
   To assess which environmental and management variables are most important for tree mortality in an ongoing bark beetle outbreak and to gain a better understanding of the challenges and recommendations for buffer zone management under the influence of nearby unmanaged stands in a protected area.
   Methods
   Norway spruce tree mortality was assessed in 419 forest stands in the High Tatra Mountains. To account for spatial and temporal autocorrelations, generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were used, and an information-theory (IT) approach was adopted for model selection to test the influence of environmental variables, natural disturbances and the previous year's sanitary cutting on bark beetle-caused tree mortality.
   Results
   In buffer zones, P. abies tree mortality caused by I. typographus was positively correlated to natural disturbances and sanitary cutting in the previous year.
   Conclusion
   The previous year's sanitary cutting, maximum temperature sums, wind disturbance and trees left in no-intervention stands contributed to tree mortality in buffer zones. In these zones, the decrease of tree mortality in response to sanitary management remained limited due to the migration of bark beetles from unmanaged areas. However, sanitary management in buffer zones remains necessary for the isolation of bark beetle outbreaks in unmanaged areas.

AB  - In this paper, the Norwegian strategy for Carbon capture and Storage (CCS) and the funding mechanisms are described. The Norwegian CCS strategy consists of three main elements:
   The RD&D programme CLIMIT
   The CO2 Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM)
   Full-scale demonstration.
   The paper describes how this chain has paved the way towards full-scale demonstration of CCS. The emphasis will be on the CLIMIT-programme and on CO2 capture technologies for energy intensive industry.
   In July 2016, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) published the results of a feasibility study on full-scale demonstration of CCS at three locations with different energy intensive industries: a cement plant, an ammonia plant and a waste incineration plant. The main findings and results from the feasibility study are also presented in this paper. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Capture-based aquaculture (CBA) is an important branch of the aquaculture industry that differs from closed cycle farming in that the stocking material consists of captured wild fish or other aquatic organisms. By skipping the difficult early production stages of fish farming, producers can test whether assumed market advantages such as high quality and consistent supply result in higher prices - and whether these are high enough to incentivize further development of CBA and eventually close the production cycle. CBA-initiatives can also be supported by different policy measures to stimulate the activity. Since these measures involve costs, it is important to know at what level and for how long these measures should be implemented to promote economically sustainable CBA activities. We study CBA of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Norway and find an average price premium of 26% compared to wild harvested cod, but with large interannual variation. However, declining quantities of cod from CBA following reductions in a quota bonus scheme to stimulate activity, indicates that the price premium is not sufficiently large to incentivize further development of the CBA branch of the Norwegian cod industry.

AB  - Researchers of adaptive capacity and sustainable livelihoods have frequently used social, cultural, human, economic and institutional capitals to better understand how rural and resource-dependent communities address environmental, social and economic stresses. Yet few studies have considered how men and women contribute differently to these capitals to support community resilience overall. Our research sought to understand the differential contributions of Sami men and women to the adaptive capacity of reindeer husbandry and reindeer herding communities in northern Sweden. Our focus revealed a gendered division of labour in reindeer herding as an economic enterprise as well as gendered contributions to a broader conceptualization of reindeer husbandry as a family and community-based practice, and as a livelihood and cultural tradition. Based on our results, we recommend that community resilience be enhanced by generating more opportunities for men to achieve higher levels of human and economic capital (particularly outside of herding activities) and encouraging women to contribute more directly to institutional capital by participating in the formation and implementation of legislation, policies and plans.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as symbionts of many tree species in temperate forests, are thought to play an important role in forest regeneration processes after large disturbances. Their reaction to different disturbance and management regimes was studied in spruce forests (Lariceto-Piceetum) 10 years after a severe windthrow in the Tatra National Park (Slovak Republic). ECM community structure was compared between different "management typesaEuro(3)-cleared area (EXT), area affected by wildfire (FIRE), uncleared area left for natural development (NEX), and mature forest as a control (REF). Based on Illumina sequencing of soil samples, we determined that the percentage of sequences assigned to ECM fungi decreased with increasing disturbance and management intensity (REF -> NEX -> EXT -> FIRE). Similarly, the total number of ECM species per each of ten sampling points per plot (100 ha) differed between managed (EXT-11 species, FIRE-9) and unmanaged (NEX-16, REF-14) treatments. On the other hand, the percentage of sequences belonging to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi increased. Management type significantly influenced the composition of the ECM community, while vegetation and soil characteristics explained less data variation. The ECM species assemblage of the unmanaged site (NEX) was the most similar to the mature forest, while that of the burnt site was the most different. Thelephora terrestris dominated in all treatments affected by windthrow, accompanied by Tylospora fibrillosa (NEX) and Tylospora asterophora (EXT and FIRE). Management regime was also the most important factor affecting ECM species composition on the roots of spruce seedlings assessed by Sanger sequencing.

AB  - The risk of spreading of alien species to protected forest habitats through recreational horse-back riding was experimentally investigated at Oulanka National Park, north-eastern Finland during 2002-2005. Levels of disturbance, horse manure and seed rain of dwarf shrubs were manipulated in genuine boreal forest habitat. Specifically we asked (i) whether the seeds of alien species can be dispersed to natural forests by horse manure and (ii) whether disturbance in soils and vegetation increases the density of alien species and decrease the density of native species. Manure addition introduced seeds of graminoid and forb species, which were absent elsewhere in the study area. Establishment of the alien species was further enhanced by the disturbance treatment. Germination of natural shrub species was enhanced by disturbance treatment, whereas manure addition had little impact on the native shrubs. The results indicate that alien species may be introduced to natural forests through recreational horse riding, if horses are fed by hay that contains germinable seeds. Soil disturbance enhances the germination of seeds. In practice, the risk of alien species to the biodiversity of natural forests may be relatively small due to the lack of continuous disturbance in these habitats. Instead, the greatest risk is caused by the possibility of alien species to spread via trails to neighbouring, extremely sensitive open habitats.

AB  - Recent years have brought the realization that evolutionary changes driven by selection can occur in ecological time scales. However, recent evolutionary events can be hard to detect and may easily go unnoticed. For harvested species, such cryptic diversity may lead to suboptimal management. These points are illustrated by the two flounder species in the Baltic Sea. Although early ecological studies identified two ecotypes of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on spawning differences, genomic studies only recently demonstrated that they were reproductively isolated species, P. flesus and P. solemdali, separated through rapid ecologically driven speciation. These morphologically indistinguishable species are harvested within a mixed-stock fishery. In the northern Baltic Sea flounder landings have declined since the mid1980s, with a drop in the Gulf of Finland (GoF) being particularly dramatic (similar to 90%). Genetic analyses of historical otolith samples from GoF catches have revealed that back in 1983 the fishery unknowingly targeted primarily P. flesus, whereas thereafter almost exclusively P. solemdali. Hence, the case of two flounder species illustrates (i) how ecological studies stimulated genetic investigations leading to discovery of ecological speciation and (ii) how cryptic species turnover discovered with genetic tools in turn improved ecological understanding with benefits to management and conservation.

AB  - Depending on their reproductive strategy, different fish species aim to aggregate or disperse eggs and larvae in their reproductive habitat. Many pelagic species disperse their eggs widely around the potential nursery areas. Larval dispersion or aggregation affects population sub-structuring, which has important implications in fisheries management and conservation of the natural spatial diversity in populations. The dispersion of larval vendace (Coregonus albula) was quantified in two oligotrophic Finnish lakes, and effects of density and environmental variables on the inter-annual variation in the larval distribution were examined by analysing spatial abundance data from the lakes from 1999 to 2017. A 3-D hydrodynamic egg distribution model was used to simulate the larval transport after hatching. Vendace larvae dispersed lake-wide to both littoral and pelagic zones but, in some littoral hot spots, more larvae aggregated year after year. However, in years of high larval number, the densities increased not only in the hot spots, but generally at all sampling plots. An overall increase in abundance was observed at all sampling sites. The simulations of the egg distribution model supported the hypothesis that the dispersion of the eggs occurs by spawners, i.e. by spawning at several different spawning sites, which are located all around the lake. The dispersion of vendace eggs and larvae can be seen as a bet-hedging strategy in space and time since in boreal oligotrophic large lakes with fragmented morphology, weather and other environmental factors in spring during hatching varies from year to year spatially in unpredictable manner. Lake-wide larval dispersion suggests that the subpopulations of adjacent lake deeps may swap considerable amounts of individuals during early life and may not be closed units. Conservation of particular habitats seems unnecessary for Finnish vendace populations where large potential spawning areas in lakes are available.

AB  - Recent findings have indicated that the carbon density and store in peat soil may increase after drainage for forestry, even if soil respiration has clearly increased. This is caused by the increased organic C flow from tree stands into soil and consequent retention in the pear matrix. Relocation of C-14-activity released from the labelled needle and fine root litter during 4- and 8-month incubation experiments showed that, on average, only 60-80% of the activity lost from litter was emitted to the atmosphere. The proportion retained in the moss layer was from 7 to 14%, in the pear soil from 7 to 18% and in the water percolated through the peat from < 1 to 8%. The results thus support the hypothesis that organic C flow may contribute to C storage in drained peat soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Saproxylic (dead-wood-associated) species of fungi are ecologically and functionally important forest-dwelling species but habitat and substrate associations of these species are still incompletely known. In particular, this applies to species that occur on less common host-tree species. We explored diversity and ecology of polypores and corticioids on the black alder (Alnus glutinosa), a little-studied substrate. In total, we collected 2528 records of 138 fungal species. We found 102 species only once or twice, and they comprised 3.8% of all the records, whereas five most numerous species comprised 59.5% of all the records. In total, 27 species were found solely on the black alder. Our results show that substrates of fungal species varied widely. Several species were restricted to specific alder substrates, while others had a remarkably wide substrate utilization, and we identified potentially at least six generalist and six specialist species. Many of the alder-associated species are rare, We conclude that also less common tree species in boreal forests can host diverse fungal assemblages. Thus, maintaining the black alder in forests enhances the diversity of saproxylic fungi.

AB  - Soil fungi are vital for regulating ecosystem carbon balance and productivity, by driving processes related to soil carbon and nutrient cycling. The rate and capacity of fungi-mediated processes are linked to fungal biomass dynamics and identifying the drivers of fungal biomass is important for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Here, ergosterol-based fungal biomass estimates and ITS2-based fungal community composition profiles were used to assess biomass of fungal guilds. Effects of forest management (thinning), environmental factors (soil chemical properties, microclimate, weather and forest stand composition) and season were related to the fungal biomass dynamics to identify the guild-specific drivers of biomass. Biomass of most fungal guilds increased with nutrient availability (nitrogen and potassium in particular) and decreased with forest thinning, and variation in total biomass was mainly driven by variation in mycorrhizal biomass. Most fungal guilds reached a minimum in biomass during summer except for mycorrhizal and root-associated ascomycetes, which instead reached a minimum during winter. Mycorrhizal fungi and root-associated ascomycetes displayed similar spatiotemporal variability in biomass. Yeasts and moulds were the only fungi displaying strong linkages with microclimate, whereas pathogenic and moss-associated fungi largely diverged in their responses to the environmental factors. The results of our study highlight that environmental factors related to the availability of soil nutrients may have an overall stronger effect on variation in biomass of fungal guilds in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forests than direct influences of microclimate, weather and forest management.

AB  - There is an increasing need to restore natural hardwood forests in landscapes dominated by monocultural conifer plantations. A convenient restoration approach is to exploit natural regeneration processes. Natural regeneration, however, is affected by diverse interacting factors, for which better understanding is required, in order to optimize restoration programs. To identify optimal management practices for improving natural regeneration of hardwood trees in coniferous plantations, we examined the effects of multiple factors on the abundance of seedlings, small saplings and large saplings (height <0.3, 0.3-1.3 and >= 1.3 m, respectively) of hardwood tree and shrub species in both line thinned (LT) and unthinned (UT) plantations of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) and hardwood forests (HF) in central Japan. The effects of management practices (number of the times of weeding and cleaning, thinning method, years after thinning and forest age), environment (slope position, slope angle and canopy openness), and landscape conditions (distance from nearest hardwood forest, altitude and landuse before planting) on the number of hardwood individuals were examined by using the data obtained from the LT plantations. We also compared hardwood density between LT and UT plantations to examine the effect of line thinning. Finally, we examined species composition of LT plantations and HF to identify hardwood forest components in the thinned plantations. The effects on hardwood regeneration of environmental conditions, landscape factors and management practices applied in the plantations varied, depending on the size class and life form of the regenerating species. The abundance of large saplings of tall tree species was affected by several management factors, especially number of the times of weeding. Landscape conditions (distance from the nearest hardwood forest and altitude) affected the abundance of small saplings and seedlings of tall tree species, but not the other classes. Seedlings and small saplings of many tall tree species that contribute to hardwood forest canopies were less abundant in the LT plantations. The results show that numerous factors affect the establishment and abundance of naturally regenerating hardwood tree species, and suggest that successful establishment during early plantation stages can have long-lasting effects on natural regeneration of tall tree species.

AB  - Stream restoration often aims to enhance fisheries by improving stream conditions for target fish species. However, river restoration has a potential impact on a variety of ecosystem services. Among stakeholders, the emerging expectations about restoration attain different priorities. How well these expectations are met influences social perceptions of success or failure. Although public support for restoration is known to have a significant impact on the sustainability and overall success of restoration, social aspects are rarely considered in this context. To address these issues, we conducted a questionnaire study among the residents and fishermen of three recently restored rivers in Finland. Results indicate that both user groups highly supported the restoration goals, but they were not always satisfied with the restoration outcomes. The changes in landscape value and amenity and fish provisioning had the highest influence on the user groups' attitudes. Restoration-induced changes in ecosystem services showed clear variation between the different locations, but the differences in the perceptions of the two user groups were less evident. Comparing perceptions between the user groups and locations and applying the ecosystem services approach are a novel contribution to the debate on restoration success. Our study highlights the importance of perspective, social-ecological context, and adequate communication for success.

AB  - The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is one of Poland's most endangered bird species, with an estimated population of 380-500 individuals in four isolated areas. To study these natural populations in Poland further, more than 900 non-invasive genetic samples were collected, along with samples from 59 birds representing large, continuous populations in Sweden and Russia; and from two centres in Poland breeding capercaillie. Microsatellite polymorphism at nine loci was then analysed to estimate within-population genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among populations. The results confirmed that isolation of populations and recent decreases in their sizes have reduced genetic diversity among capercaillie in Poland, with all the country's natural populations found to be experiencing the genetic after-effects of demographic bottlenecks. The results of analyses of genetic differentiation and structure further suggest the presence of a 'lowland' cluster (encompassing birds of the Augustowska and Solska Primaeval Forests in Poland, and of Sweden and Russia), and a Carpathian cluster. Capercaillie from Sweden and Russia are also found to differ markedly. The Polish lowland populations seem more closely related to birds from Scandinavia. Our genetic analysis also indicates that the stocks at breeding centres are of a high genetic diversity effectively reflecting the origins of founder individuals, though identification of ancestry requires further study in the case of some birds.
   Overall, the results sustain the conclusion that the Polish populations of capercaillie from the Carpathians and the lowlands should be treated as independent Management Units (MUs). This is to say that the breeding lines associated with these two sources should be maintained separately at breeding centres. The high level of genetic differentiation of birds from the Solska Primaeval Forest suggests that this population should also be assigned the status of independent MU.

AB  - Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis pose a major threat to the sustainable development of salmonid farming. To investigate effects of farm-origin salmon lice on wild salmonids, salmon lice dynamics are typically simulated using models that depend on experimentally determined rates of development, reproduction, mortality and infestation. Several recent studies provide new estimates of how these demographic rates depend on temperature and salinity. Here, we review and synthesize these studies and test if updating a salmon lice infestation model based on the new insights improves predictions of salmon lice infestations on salmon post-smolts in experimental cages in the sea. This model predicts spatiotemporal variation in infestation pressure based on weekly monitoring data of salmon lice and sea temperature in all salmonid fish farms in Norway, here supplemented by temperature and salinity data from a regional ocean model. Using data from 2012-2017 to select model formulation, we found the largest improvement in explanatory power by incorporating a salinity-dependent infestation rate. Updating functions for temperature-dependent egg production and infestation rates led to smaller improvements. Moreover, results suggest additional effects of temperature and a possible temperature-salinity interaction effect, not captured by the modelled processes. Out-of-sample predictions for experimental cage data from 2018-2020 confirmed that the uncertainty was realistically quantified, but also showed that associations of salmon lice infestations with salinity and temperature had changed. These results provide a field evaluation of experimental data and point to a knowledge gap regarding the combined effects of temperature and salinity on salmon lice infestations.

AB  - Nearly 60% of European wetlands have been lost to drainage or to the cessation of grassland management. Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

AB  - Afforestation has been the dominant land-use change in the Swiss Alps during the last decades which has not only the potential to increase soil organic carbon sequestration, but it has also the potential to alter soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics through the vegetation shift and change in organic matter (OM) input into soils. The effects of afforestation on SOM dynamics, however, are still not fully understood as specific sources of OM and modifications of soil processes influencing decomposition and preservation remain largely unknown on alpine to subalpine slopes. Within this study we aimed to identify the potential sources and the decomposition of OM in a subalpine afforestation chrono-sequence (0-130 years) with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) on a former pasture by using a multi-proxy molecular marker approach. We observed that leaf-derived OM plays an essential role in the pasture areas, while root-derived OM only plays a minor role in pasture and forest areas. Needle-derived OM represents the dominant source of SOM with increasing forest age, while understory shrubs and moss also contribute to the OM input in younger forest stand ages. However, needle litter and buildup of organic layers and subsequently less input of fresh OM from organic horizons to mineral soil can result in increased OM decomposition in mineral soils rather than contributing to additional SOM stabilization in mineral soils. This was most pronounced in the oldest forest stand (130-year-old) in the investigated afforestation sequence, particularly in deeper soil horizons (10-45 cm). Thereby, our study provides new insights into SOM dynamics following afforestation, especially with respect to the long-term SOM sequestration potential of afforestation of subalpine pasture soils.

AB  - There is currently substantial interest in valuing various services provided by different ecosystems. Concurrently economists have ascribed substantial effort on expanding traditional forest accounting systems by environmental services. This paper contributes to curtailing the existing gap between green accounting theory and applications for valuing forest ecosystem services. The multitude of links between forest ecosystem services and economy are characterized by the theoretical model for forest-economy interactions. By utilizing recently updated data we also incorporate empirical value estimates of these services comparable to other goods into Finnish forest accounting system. Finally, we discuss some problems encountered and clarify the interpretation of some value estimates incorporated to national forest account. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maerl beds worldwide face habitat destruction (e.g. from dredging, fishing gear and fish farms), the combined pressures of ocean warming and acidification, and the spread of invasive species. Maerl beds have high conservation status in European legislation, yet their associated flora is poorly known. Here, we evaluate the known macroalgal diversity of NE Atlantic maerl beds from Svalbard to Portugal. Maerl beds occur from the low intertidal down to 51 m in the clearest waters. To date, 349 macroalgal species have been recorded on maerl in the NE Atlantic (67 % are Rhodophyta), a remarkable 30 % of the total seaweed diversity in this region. Eleven non-native species have been recorded on Atlantic European maerl beds, the most widely distributed being phases of Bonnemaisonia hamifera ("Trailliella intricata"), Asparagopsis armata ("Falkenbergia rufolanosa"), Antithamnionella spirographidis and Heterosiphonia japonica. The flora of maerl beds off Iceland and Norway is poorly known, but maerl beds off Britain, Ireland, France and Spain have been surveyed extensively and support several species that are maerl specialists (i.e. Cruoria cruoriaeformis, Cladophora rhodolithicola, Gelidiella calcicola). Our observations of G. calcicola and Gelidium maggsiae are new records for Portugal. Maerl beds in the Algarve have many of the same macroalgal species as Mediterranean maerl beds, but they are not as floristically diverse as those in Galicia because they are confined to deeper water. Our census pro(v)ides a baseline that can be used to assess changes to these habitats over the coming years.

AB  - Industrial meat production has several negative environmental effects. Governments' agricultural policies aim for cost efficiency combined with high environmental and animal welfare, which puts farmers in a difficult situation trying to navigate between sometimes contradictory requirements. This paper studies how Swedish pig farmers resolve or cope with conflicting goals in pig farming. We have analysed the regulations governing EU and Swedish pig farming. We have also interviewed five Swedish pig farmers about their views of the different goals of pig farming and strategies for resolving conflicts between the goals of low environmental impact, high animal welfare and enough profitability to continue farming. The greatest divide was between the conventional farmers, who emphasized natural resource efficiency, and the organic farmers who stressed animal welfare, multifunctionality and ecosystem service delivery. We suggest four strategies to contribute to resolving some of the conflicting goals: improve communication about different types of pig farming; use public procurement as a driver towards more sustainable pork production; work towards improving the Common Agricultural Policy, perhaps by implementing payments for ecosystem services or multifunctionality; and finally, decrease the total production of pork to lower the emissions per land unit.

AB  - European beech forest with a variable admixture is one of the most important forest types in Central Europe. Growing evidence has demonstrated the positive effect of increased biodiversity on vital forest ecosystem functions and services such as productivity and nutrient cycling. Both complementarity in resource use and species identity are known to influence tree productivity but they have received relatively little attention in observational studies. Using a large dataset of repeat inventory trees in a near-natural deciduous forest in Central Germany we test whether tree diversity enhances tree productivity at the tree and the stand level, whilst accounting for tree size, tree vitality, local topography and the potentially confounding effects of spatial autocorrelation and negative growth estimates. Beech and hornbeam individual tree growth was sensitive to their neighbourhood diversity and composition whilst ash trees were only sensitive to the neighbourhood tree density. Neighbourhood complementarity effects were driven by differences in species' competitive strengths, whilst at the stand level productivity gains were primarily attributable to the density of ash and diversity effects were less prominent. We conclude that small-scale admixture with patches of different species promotes tree growth in European beech forest; congruent with current management plans for beech and hardwood forests.

AB  - Farmers' and citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy of the current action-oriented and the proposed resultoriented agri-environmental schemes (AES) are poorly known. To help fill this gap, this study analysed such perceptions in the context of Finnish citizens and farmers. Hypotheses on legitimacy, ecosystem service perceptions and environmental values were developed and empirically tested with nationwide surveys of Finnish citizens (n =1,744) and farmers (n =1,215) using t-test and multiple linear regression. The results demonstrated that Finnish citizens perceive the proposed result-oriented AES as more legitimate, whereas Finnish farmers attribute greater legitimacy to the current action-oriented AES. Among both groups, a preference for actionoriented AES, and reluctance to change them, was associated with the perception that Finnish agriculture has been successful in producing ecosystem services. Among both groups, environmental preferences were associated with the legitimation of both AES. The conclusion is that in order for a change in AES to be legitimate, that change should be perceived as necessary, justified and based on the values considered important by farmers and citizens.

AB  - Minerals mining and processing companies (hereinafter referred to as minerals industry) face the increasing demand for a comprehensive approach towards innovations aimed at sustainability. While the ability to learn from external sources of knowledge is at the core of this process, lack of geographical proximity and multiplicity of external sources impose challenges for mineral companies in this respect. The present study proposes that organizational, institutional and cognitive proximities could provide a platform for this industry to overcome those challenges, thereby achieving a superior innovation performance across various sustainability dimensions. Results of an analysis based on a sample of 101 mineral companies in Norway reveal that these dimensions of proximity are conducive to process, product and social innovation in different ways. More specifically, organizational proximity (diversity of non-local collaborations) and informal institutional proximity (shared cultural norms and values) spur social innovation. Furthermore, formal institutional proximity (similarity of rules and laws) and cognitive proximity (familiarity of knowledge base) support both process and product innovations. This paper provides some insights on the determinants of innovation in sustainability contexts, and contributes to the recent debate on the role of non-spatial proximity dimensions for innovation in the peripheral regions.

AB  - Swedish agricultural land comprises about 3 Mha and its topsoil contains about 270 Mt C (0-25 cm depth). Based on daily climate data, annual yield data and a soil database, we calculate the topsoil C dynamics for Swedish agricultural land 1990-2004, using a soil C balance model, ICBM. Losses from high C (organic) soils are calculated from subsidence, which in turn is calculated from soil properties, cropping system and weather conditions. We also present scenarios and projections into the future. Mineral soils are close to balance in all of the eight agricultural regions investigated. Average soil C mass roughly increases from South to North, since the lower yields and thus C inputs in Northern regions are more than balanced by the higher decomposition rates due to warmer climate in the South. The higher proportion of grass leys in the North also contributes to higher C mass. High C soils (> 7% C, corresponding to 12% soil organic matter content) lose 2-6 t C ha(-1) year(-1), depending on weather and cropping system, and total annual loss from Swedish agricultural high-C soils is about 1 Mt year(-1). This loss is discussed in the context of plant production and remedial actions. Projections into the future, assuming that a temperature increase leading to increased decomposition rates also will lead to higher yields, indicate a potential to at least maintain soil C mass in Swedish agricultural mineral soils. Growing crops with residues more resistant towards decomposition would be an efficient way to increase soil C mass. See also http://www-mv.slu.se/vaxtnaring/olle.

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation are promoted at international, national, and local levels by both scholars and practitioners. However, local planning practices that support these approaches are scattered, and measures are neither systematically implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation, which is an important factor in only around half of all measures. Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate measures/ designs, related operations, and policy processes at different scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in municipal governance and planning.

AB  - Protected areas are meant to preserve native local communities within their boundaries, but they are not independent from their surroundings. Impoverished habitat quality in the matrix might influence the species composition within the protected areas through biotic homogenization. The aim of this study was to determine the impacts of matrix quality on species richness and trait composition of bird communities from the Finnish reserve area network and whether the communities are being subject of biotic homogenization due to the lowered quality of the landscape matrix. We used joint species distribution modeling to study how characteristics of the Finnish forest reserves and the quality of their surrounding matrix alter species and trait compositions of forest birds. The proportion of old forest within the reserves was the main factor in explaining the bird community composition, and the bird communities within the reserves did not strongly depend on the quality of the matrix. Yet, in line with the homogenization theory, the beta-diversity within reserves embedded in low-quality matrix was lower than that in high-quality matrix, and the average abundance of regionally abundant species was higher. Influence of habitat quality on bird community composition was largely explained by the species' functional traits. Most importantly, the community specialization index was low, and average body size was high in areas with low proportion of old forest. We conclude that for conserving local bird communities in northern Finnish protected forests, it is currently more important to improve or maintain habitat quality within the reserves than in the surrounding matrix. Nevertheless, we found signals of bird community homogenization, and thus, activities that decrease the quality of the matrix are a threat for bird communities.

AB  - Developing adaptation measures in forestry is an urgent task because the forests regenerated today will have to cope with climate conditions that may drastically change during the life of the trees in the stand. This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The adaptation measures include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of forestry operations. Measures targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. Adaptation measures mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable adaptation measures to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of adaptation measures creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned adaptation measures.

AB  - Limiting temperature rise below 2 degrees C requires large deployment of Negative Emission Technologies (NET) to capture and store atmospheric CO2. Compared to other types of NETs, biochar has emerged as a mature option to store carbon in soils while providing several co-benefits and limited trade-offs. Existing life-cycle assessment studies of biochar systems mostly focus on climate impacts from greenhouse gasses (GHGs), while other forcing agents, effects on soil emissions, other impact categories, and the implications of a large-scale national deployment are rarely jointly considered. Here, we consider all these aspects and quantify the environmental impacts of application to agricultural soils of biochar from forest residues available in Norway considering different scenarios (including mixing of biochar with synthetic fertilizers and bio-oil sequestration for long-term storage). All the biochar scenarios deliver negative emissions under a life-cycle perspective, ranging from-1.72 +/- 0.45 tonnes CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1) to-7.18 +/- 0.67 tonnes CO2-eq. ha(-1) yr(-1) (when bio-oil is sequestered). Esti-mated negative emissions are robust to multiple climate metrics and a large range of uncertainties tested with a Monte-Carlo analysis. Co-benefits exist with crop yields, stratospheric ozone depletion and marine eutrophica-tion, but potential trade-offs occur with tropospheric ozone formation, fine particulate formation, terrestrial acidification and ecotoxicity. At a national level, biochar has the potential to offset between 13% and 40% of the GHG emissions from the Norwegian agricultural sector. Overall, our study shows the importance of integrating emissions from the supply chain with those from agricultural soils to estimate mitigation potentials of biochar in specific regional contexts.

AB  - Forests are increasingly threatened by windthrows but those composed of uneven-aged stand plots are generally less impacted by their effects. As a consequence, the management of such forests should be based on a joint management of all their different uneven-aged stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of uneven-aged forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of uneven-aged stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of uneven-aged forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint uneven-aged forest management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent uneven-aged forest management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint uneven-aged forest management model. Second, we find that the independent uneven-aged forest management model poorly approximates the optimal multi-stand harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.

AB  - Economic development creates challenges for land-use planners in balancing between increasing the use of natural resources and safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. We developed and utilized multi-objective numeric optimization models to analyze the trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). The approach was used in the land-use planning process in northern Finland when selecting potential peat production sites as a part of the development of the regional master plan. We first quantified Net Present Value (NPV) of peat production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water emissions of peatlands. Then we applied multi-objective optimization to examine the trade-offs between the variables as well as to determine a cost-efficient selection of potential peat production sites, that is, a selection which would simultaneously generate the greatest possible economic returns and environmental benefits. Our results showed that with a relatively small decrease in NPV, a substantial decrease in biodiversity loss and a reduction in water emissions compared to the benchmark level could be attained. However, a significant decrease in GHG emissions resulted in a substantial decrease in NPV. We conclude that it is possible to significantly improve land-use management by applying multi-objective optimization in land-use planning.

AB  - This study aims to identify and evaluate the spatial distribution of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) benefits perceived by people in both urban and rural areas. A public participation GIS (PPGIS) approach was applied with local people who responded to an online survey and mapped their important places related to CES benefits in the Kokemaenjoki area. We explore the perceived ecosystem services of the community using different infrastructure types (green, grey, yellow and blue) based on the Corine Land Cover (CLC) classes. We identified spatial patterns of mapped important places using kernel dens ity estimation and related CES benefit associations with the infrastructures using chi-square residuals. We found that CES in urban areas are provided more often when there is more than one type of infrastructure (e.g., grey and green; grey and blue), but grey infrastructures are preferred in urban areas, while blue infrastructures produce more CES benefits in rural areas.

AB  - Understanding migratory patterns is important for predicting and mitigating unwanted consequences of environmental change or anthropogenic challenges on vulnerable species. Wild Atlantic salmon undergo challenging migrations between freshwater and marine environments, and the numbers of salmon returning to their natal rivers to reproduce have declined over several decades. Mortality from sea lice linked to fish farms within their seaward migration routes is proposed as a contributing factor to these declines. Here, we used 31 microsatellite markers to establish a genetic baseline for the main rivers in the Hardangerfjord, western Norway. Mixed stock analysis was used to assign Atlantic salmon post-smolts caught in trawls in 2013-2017 back to regional reporting units. Analyses demonstrated that individuals originating from rivers located in the inner region of the fjord arrived at the outer fjord later than individuals from middle and outer fjord rivers. Therefore, as post-smolts originating from inner rivers also have to migrate longer distances to exit the fjord, these data suggest that inner fjord populations are more likely to be at risk of mortality through aquaculture-produced sea lice, and other natural factors such as predation, than middle or outer fjord populations with earlier exit times and shorter journeys. These results will be used to calibrate models estimating mortality from sea lice on wild salmon for the regulation of the Norwegian aquaculture industry.

AB  - Natural disturbances, such as avalanches, snow breakage, insect outbreaks, windthrow or fires shape mountain forests globally. However, in many regions over the past centuries human activities have strongly influenced forest dynamics, especially following natural disturbances, thus limiting our understanding of natural ecological processes, particularly in densely-settled regions. In this contribution we briefly review the current understanding of changes in forest cover, forest structure, and disturbance regimes in the mountain forests across the European Alps over the past millennia. We also quantify changes in forest cover across the entire Alps based on inventory data over the past century. Finally, using the Swiss Alps as an example, we analyze in-depth changes in forest cover and forest structure and their effect on patterns of fire and wind disturbances, based on digital historic maps from 1880, modern forest cover maps, inventory data on current forest structure, topographical data, and spatially explicit data on disturbances. This multifaceted approach presents a long-term and detailed picture of the dynamics of mountain forest ecosystems in the Alps. During pre-industrial times, natural disturbances were reduced by fire suppression and land-use, which included extraction of large amounts of biomass that decreased total forest cover. More recently, forest cover has increased again across the entire Alps (on average +4% per decade over the past 25115 years). Live tree volume (+10% per decade) and dead tree volume (mean +59% per decade) have increased over the last 1540 years in all regions for which data were available. In the Swiss Alps secondary forests that established after 1880 constitute approximately 43% of the forest cover. Compared to forests established previously, post-1880 forests are situated primarily on steep slopes (>30 degrees), have lower biomass, a more aggregated forest structure (primarily stem-exclusion stage), and have been more strongly affected by fires, but less affected by wind disturbance in the 20th century. More broadly, an increase in growing stock and expanding forest areas since the mid-19th century have - along with climatic changes - contributed to an increasing frequency and size of disturbances in the Alps. Although many areas remain intensively managed, the extent, structure, and dynamics of the forests of the Alps reflect natural drivers more strongly today than at any time in the past millennium.

AB  - In sustainable rural development, national and international policies are interpreted and implemented through local networks and involvement of local actors with various backgrounds, needs and objectives. We explored how forest owners' land management and biodiversity conservation objectives, as well as social capital embedded in their social networks were related to success in nature conservation, i.e., voluntary conservation contracts made as a part of the Forest Biodiversity Program for Southern Finland. The survey data of forest owners (N = 509) were analyzed with multivariate generalized linear modeling. The networks involving forestry actors exhibited highest levels of trust, information seeking and perceived similarity of goals. The act of making a conservation agreement, as well as the type of conservation agreement made, was associated with the endorsement of biodiversity objectives and the three dimensions of social capital analyzed in the study. More specifically, owners who had made a conservation agreement perceived environmental and forestry actors' goals as similar to theirs, trusted in them most often, and sought information from them more frequently than owners who did not have any contract. Moreover, the owners with a fixed-term contract expressed goal similarity, trust, and information seeking behavior towards forestry actors more frequently than owners with a permanent contract, who in turn expressed the above ties more frequently towards environmental actors. These results increase the understanding of the role and importance of forest owners' diverse social networks in voluntary nature conservation agreements. The findings encourage the utilization of these networks more systematically and dynamically while implementing rural, environmental and forest policies in order to increase their societal impact in local contexts.

AB  - The agricultural sector has potentially a significant role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Besides providing public goods, GHG reduction offers farmers new alternatives for income generation. This is especially interesting in marginal agricultural areas, e.g., in less-favoured areas (LFA) of the European Union (EU), where significant GHG reduction potential coincides with low productivity in the production of agricultural commodities.
   In this study, the effects of peatland cultivation restrictions were evaluated, where the objective was to decrease GHG fluxes deriving from agricultural production. The regional role of peatlands in GHG reduction and agricultural production is also evaluated. Ceasing the agricultural use of peatlands altogether could decrease Finnish agricultural sector carbon effluents by up to 10% according to a dynamic regional sector model of the Finnish agriculture (DREMFIA). Accompanying decreases in national and even in regional agricultural incomes do not appear drastic, but locally, in some municipalities and on individual farms they may be devastating. In an alternative scenario, where perennial grass production is allowed to continue and only cultivation of annual crops is forbidden, the (negative) income effects are very low. The most notable result is that significant GHG reductions can be reached with little decrease in national agricultural incomes.
   The two forms of restrictions were tested in two alternative agricultural policy settings: Agenda 2000 and the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform agreed in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003. These two agricultural policy alternatives are connected with both of the aforementioned climate policy alternatives and resulting scenarios are evaluated in the simulation. The simulation provides the second main result, which says that it is not so much the climate policy which determines aggregate agricultural production and income, but rather it is the general agricultural policy framework setting the stage.

AB  - Aim: Isolation is expected to lead to negative impacts on populations due to a reduction in effective population size and gene flow, exacerbating the effects of genetic drift, which might be stronger in peripheral and fragmented populations. Fagus sylvatica (European beech) in southern Sweden presents a gradient of isolation towards the leading range edge of the species. We sought to determine the impact of long-term isolation on genetic diversity and population genetic structure within populations of this species.
   Location: Samples were obtained from 14 sites towards the northern edge of the native range of beech in Sweden.
   Taxon: Fagaceae.
   Methods: Using historical sources, we obtained area- and distance-based measures of isolation. We measured genetic diversity and structure by using nuclear microsatellite marker data, and performed parentage analysis to estimate external pollen-mediated gene flow. We implemented a partial least squares regression to determine the effects of isolation on each of the genetic diversity estimators and the measures of external pollen-mediated gene flow.
   Results: Long-term isolation generally had a negative impact on genetic diversity, which is exacerbated over time, further affecting progeny and suggesting that isolated populations are subject to strong genetic drift, possibly due to the combination of founder events and persistent small population sizes. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed that isolation was also acting as a barrier to gene flow in the north-eastern distribution of beech.
   Main conclusions: Isolation at the leading range edge of beech in Sweden has created gradients of contemporary gene flow within the species. The long-term cumulative effects of isolation on this wind-pollinated tree species and its negative impacts on genetic diversity and gene flow, could lead to inbreeding depression and higher extinction risk where populations remain small and isolated.

AB  - Predicting the consequences of environmental changes, including human-mediated climate change on species, requires that we quantify range-wide patterns of genetic diversity and identify the ecological, environmental, and historical factors that have contributed to it. Here, we generate baseline data on polar bear population structure across most Canadian subpopulations (n = 358) using 13,488 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD). Our ddRAD dataset showed three genetic clusters in the sampled Canadian range, congruent with previous studies based on microsatellites across the same regions; however, due to a lack of sampling in Norwegian Bay, we were unable to confirm the existence of a unique cluster in that subpopulation. These data on the genetic structure of polar bears using SNPs provide a detailed baseline against which future shifts in population structure can be assessed, and opportunities to develop new noninvasive tools for monitoring polar bears across their range.

AB  - Lawns are considered monocultures and lesser contributors to sustainability than diverse nature but are still a dominating green area feature and an important cultural phenomenon in cities. Lawns have esthetical values, provide playground, are potential habitat for species, contribute to carbon sequestration and water infiltration, but also increase pesticides, fertilization, aremonocultures and costly to manage at the same time. To evaluate the potential impact of lawns, whether positive or negative, it is of interest to estimate the total lawn cover in cities and its change over time. This is not a straightforward process, e.g., because many lawns are small and covered by trees. In this study we review the existing literature of lawn cover in cities and the different methodologies used for cover estimation. We found both pros and cons with NDVI and LiDAR data as well as manually interpreted aerial photos. The total cover of lawns in three case study cities was estimated to 22.5%. By extrapolating these percentages to all Swedish cities lawn cover was estimated to 2589 km(2) (0.6% of the terrestrial surface). The approximated total municipal management cost of lawns in all Swedish cities was 910,000,000 USD/year. During 50 years lawn area almost doubled in relative cover and 56% of them were continuously managed. Since lawns constitute large parts of the urban greenery and are costly to manage it is highly relevant to consider their social, ecological and cultural value compared to alternatives, e.g., meadows with less intensive management.

AB  - Heterogeneity in species assemblages of forest-floor arthropods carabid beetles, ants and spiders - within and between different forest age classes was studied in the southern Finnish talga. The importance of processes operating on the local scale (within the movement radius of the species) vs on the regional scale (among forest stands) in determining the observed variation was assessed. Four data sets with different spatial resolutions in mesic forests in the same general study area were used. The material consists of 18 283 carabids of 51 species. 48 769 spiders of 212 species, and 126 718 worker ants of 23 species. Analyses of abundance variation and species complementarity among successional stages revealed that in all the three taxa species occurring in the mature forest were prevalent in the younger successional stages as well, constituting more than half of the catch in any age class. A great majority of carabid and spider species were widely distributed across the forest age classes, whereas ants include a higher proportion of species with a narrower amplitude across the succession gradient. Comparisons of similarity between samples at increasing distance from one another on the local scale within forest stands (a few tens of meters to a few hundreds of meters) showed a quite consistent pattern in carabids and spiders: there was more variation between sampling sites in young successional forests than in the mature forest. Furthermore, only in the mature forest a slight, albeit statistically not significant, negative relationship between similarity of samples and distance between sampling sites was detected. In carabids and spiders, comparisons between samples located at a distance of 10-15 m from each other showed considerable heterogeneity, the mean percentage similarity being c. 0.6 (in ants c. 0.8). On the regional scale, systematic variation between young and mature forest stands is a major element increasing the total diversity (species turnover c. 50% in carabids and spiders: compositional similarity c. 0.3 0.4 in carabids, 0.2 0.3 in spiders), but variation within forest stands on a spatial scale of 10-15 meters is another important component in the total heterogeneity. The results suggest that regional abundance variation is a primary factor influencing the composition of local assemblages: a set of hypotheses elaborating this conclusion is formulated. The results implies that maintenance of habitat heterogeneity on a small scale (10-15 m) is needed to preserve biodiversity in managed forests.

AB  - The aim of this work is (i) to review the recent studies on weather and climate change in Finnish Sapmi and to present the literature review findings alongside our survey on the observations made by local reindeer herders on the same phenomena, and, further, (ii) to review the impacts of climate change on the ecosystem services (ES) in Finnish Sapmi. The focus of the study is on the impacts of climate change on those habitat, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services which are interconnected with the Saami way of life as Indigenous people and thus support the continuity of their culture. In the holistic world view of Arctic Indigenous peoples, material culture and non-material culture are not separated, and there is no boundary between nature and culture. However, cultural and spiritual meanings of ecosystems, species and landscapes are rarely taken into account in scientific research on ecosystems services. Our review indicates that mostly negative impacts of climate warming on ecosystems and traditional livelihoods are to be expected in Sapmi. The most profound negative impacts will be on palsa mire and fell ecosystems, in particular snowbeds, snow patches and mountain birch forests. Consequently, changes in ecosystems may erode cultural meanings, stories, memories and traditional knowledge attached to them and affect the nature-based traditional livelihoods. In a situation where our rapidly changing climate is affecting the foundations of the nature-based cultures, the present review can provide a knowledge base for developing adaptation actions and strategies for local communities and Indigenous peoples to cope with changes caused by climate change and other drivers.

AB  - Forestry practices that aim to increase biomass production may mitigate climate change through increased carbon sequestration and the potential of substituting fossil fuels with renewable biofuels. Fertilising young stands of Norway spruce in Sweden have shown to increase tree growth by more than 200%. Fertilisation, however, also has other effects on forest ecosystems. Here, we studied the response of the species composition of forest-floor vegetation to three different frequencies of fertilisation in young stands of Norway spruce. Fertiliser was applied every year, every second year or every third year. The total amount of N ranged from 425 kg ha(-1) to 625 kg ha(-1), in combination with P, K. Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Zi, B and Cu. The largest effects of the fertilisation were found among bryophytes and lichens, which lost substantial cover. Unexpectedly, Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly known to be favoured by fertilisation, was negatively affected. Species that increased in frequency were Oxalis acetosella, Brachythecium sp. and Plagiothecium sp. Decreased availability of light, as an indirect effect of fertilisation through increased tree canopy cover, was found to be the most important factor behind the change in species composition of vascular plants. The total cover of bryophytes, however, did not show any significant response to the changes in canopy cover, indicating that the effects seen in this group may be a result of more direct effects of the fertiliser. Few significant differences were found between the two most intensive fertilisation frequencies, although fertilisation every third year was often distinguished from both the control and the other fertilised treatments. Even though the effects at the stand level were substantial, the effects on biodiversity and function of ecosystems on a landscape or regional level need further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sweden has the potential to increase fuel pellet production from alternative raw materials, such as willow and poplar, and also to use former agricultural land for energy crop production. This study used a life cycle perspective to investigate district heat production from pellets produced from willow or poplar cultivated on fallow land in Sweden. The energy efficiency and global warming potential of the systems was evaluated, additionally was the climate impact, expressed in global mean surface temperature change, evaluated from annual greenhouse gas data, including the most relevant fossil and biogenic sources and sinks. The systems were also compared with a fossil fuel alternative in which coal was assumed to be used for heat production. The results showed that the systems investigated had a cooling effect on both global mean surface temperature and global warming potential within the 100-year study period owing mainly to an increase in live biomass and a more long-term increase in soil organic carbon (C), which shows the importance of land use. At the same time, the systems produced renewable energy. The poplar system contributed to a larger cooling effect than the willow system due to more C being sequestered in live biomass and soil in the longer growth periods between harvests and to higher yield. The energy efficiency of the willow and poplar systems used for pellet fuel production was about 11 times the energy input. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the ability to control an invasive species and to protect an ecologically similar native species it is essential to map the exact distributions of both species. This is difficult if the species are so morphologically similar that their identification in the field is almost impossible. In Finland, the invasive North American beaver Castor canadensis is spreading towards the range of the native Eurasian beaver Castor fiber and at present, these species are partly sympatric. Effective management of these morphologically similar species requires an efficient method for species identification, ideally one that is non-invasive. Non-invasive genetic methods are used in a wide variety of wildlife species, for example in the research of large carnivores. Feces are a good source of DNA for terrestrial animals, but for the semi-aquatic animals like beavers, feces are not the best option. However, environmental DNA (eDNA) has been successfully used to detect species non-invasively in aquatic and terrestrial environments. We developed a non-invasive, eDNA-based method to map the distribution of the beaver species in Finland and to investigate within-species genetic diversity. The eDNA was obtained from the feed remains (wood chips) from beaver forage sites. With the help of Citizen science, wood chip samples were collected from different parts of Finland. We used our eDNA method to identify the ranges of both beaver species. Additionally, the presence of Eurasian beavers in south-east Finland was proven for the first time. Our non-invasive eDNA method is an effective way to accurately identify the ranges of both beaver species and will allow for the control of the invasive North American beaver and conservation of the native Eurasian beaver in Finland.

AB  - Long-term changes in composition, structure and biodiversity (i.e. taxonomic richness, diversity index, species traits and habitat-affinity) of interstitial assemblages were studied in two floodplain systems: a restored backwater and an artificial drainage canal. Before restoration, the backwater, affected by both terrestrialisation and eutrophication, was weakly populated by a low diversified fauna dominated by walkers, macrofauna, detritivores, and stygoxenes (i.e. taxa that occur incidentally in ground waters) that reproduce biparentally and lack parental care. This backwater displayed an upstream-downstream gradient in response to restoration works. Upstream, the dredging of fine organic sediments favoured inputs of nutrient-poor groundwater and exchanges between groundwater and surface water that induced an increase in taxonomic richness (in both herbivores and stygoxenes). Downstream the deposition of fine sediment that was suspended in the water column by restoration work enhanced colmation that induced a decrease in herbivore and swimming taxa, and an increase in mesofaunal taxa, whilst phreatobites (i.e. taxa specialized to interstitial life) remained absent from the system. The drainage canal that was artificially hollowed-out to lower the surrounding water table, harbors mixed assemblages of epigean (i.e. taxa of surface-water habitats) and hypogean (i.e. taxa of groundwater habitats) taxa. The upstream part, which is weakly influenced by surface waters, was colonized by phreatobites as oligotrophic conditions increased. The intermediate part, which is fed by surface water and where mesotrophic conditions occurred as habitats progressively matured and diversified, showed diversification of its fauna. The downstream part of the drainage canal displayed the reverse dynamic - this suggests a reduction in groundwater supply due to the clogging of sediment interstices fine sediments, the deposition of which is linked to the Rossillon backwater restoration works.

AB  - We conducted a statistical analysis of taxonomic and functional groups, of some ecological characteristics (edaphic factors, macro- and micro-habitats) and of the distribution of macrofungi in Sweden, based on an ecological data catalog of 3196 species. We placed particular emphasis on a comparison of threatened and non-threatened taxa. Differences in the proportions of threatened macrofungi were found among both taxonomic and functional groups, partly explained by a lack of information on some of the groups. A comparatively high proportion of threatened taxa occur in semi-natural open habitats such as calcareous grasslands and in southern deciduous hardwood forests on high-pH soils. Another habitat type of major importance for red-listed species is the boreal spruce forest. A high proportion of the wood-inhabiting species are red-listed; this is probably a result of the dramatic decrease in decaying wood in Swedish forests during this century. Both the absolute number of species and the absolute and relative numbers of threatened species from south to north. Many functional and habitat characteristics differed between regions. Our overall results were largely consistent with those found for forest plants and animals. Some differences, however, were found when comparing macrofungal characteristics and levels of threat to macrofungi between Sweden and other European countries. Among the main threats to macrofungi in Sweden are modern forestry, the decrease of semi-natural open habitats as a result of changed land management practices, and in southern Sweden, probably also air pollution.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) may be both non-market and market based. Both may provide important input to societal welfare. Using natural resources, or converting nature in the development of market based ES may impact the access to non-market or more conservationist ES, and vice versa. How does the general public trade-off between these two types of ES? We use two valuation studies in Northern Norway to identify the public's preferences for marine industries versus other marine use and non-use values. One study assesses willingness to pay to protect cold-water corals, a relatively abundant, and to some degree, protected resource off the coast of Norway. The other study elicits people's willingness to pay for stricter regulations of industrial activity in the coastal zone, providing more coastal area for recreational activities. Both studies show strong conservation preferences, and willingness to forego blue industrial growth. However, these preferences are heterogeneous across socio-economic characteristics, and, interestingly, educational level is the characteristic that most distinctly separates the population into various preference groups.

AB  - Movement diversity within species represent an important but often neglected, component of biodiversity that affects ecological and genetic interactions, as well as the productivity of exploited systems.By combining individual tracking data from acoustic telemetry with novel genetic analyses, we describe the movement diversity of two Atlantic cod Gadus morhua ecotypes in two high-latitude fjord systems: the highly migratory Northeast Arctic cod (NEA cod) that supports the largest cod fishery in the world, and the more sedentary Norwegian coastal cod, which is currently in a depleted state.As predicted, coastal cod displayed a higher level of fjord residency than NEA cod. Of the cod tagged during the spawning season, NEA cod left the fjords permanently to a greater extent and earlier compared to coastal cod, which to a greater extent remained resident and left the fjords temporarily. Despite this overall pattern, horizontal movements atypical for the ecotypes were common with some NEA cod remaining within the fjords year-round and some coastal cod displaying a low fjord fidelity. Fjord residency and exit timing also differed with spawning status and body size, with spawning cod and large individuals tagged during the feeding season more prone to leave the fjords and earlier than non-spawning and smaller individuals.While our results confirm a lower fjord dependency for NEA cod, they highlight a movement diversity within each ecotype and sympatric residency between ecotypes, previously undetected by population-level monitoring. This new knowledge is relevant for the management, which should base their fisheries advice for these interacting ecotypes on their habitat use and seasonal movements.

AB  - Biological invasions threaten global biodiversity and forest ecosystems; therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate strategies for combating the spread of invasive species. Natural regeneration of eastern beech (Fagus orientalisLipsky) is considerably limited by an aggressive invasive shrub, pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticumL.), in the Black Sea Region of Turkey. Therefore, the future character of the region's forests is uncertain. The aim of this research was to evaluate the structure of beech forests with different management regimes of rhododedron and to determine the interaction among tree layer, rhododendron cover, and natural regeneration in Duzce Province using the FieldMap technology. The following variants of forests were compared: without intervention (control) and three and six years after rhododendron clearance. The results showed that tree density ranged between 175-381 trees ha(-1)and stand volume between 331-589 m(3)ha(-1). The horizontal structure of the tree layer was mostly random, and the spatial pattern of natural regeneration was aggregated. Recruit density and height in the beech stands were significantly differentiated due to the influence of presence or absence of invasive rhododendron. Rhododendron cover ranged between 81%-97%, and woody stems amounted to 72,178-86,884 ha(-1)in unmanaged forests. Canopy in the overstory did not have a significant effect on the density of regeneration and rhododendron cover. Tree layer had a significant negative influence on natural regeneration within a 4 m radius on the plots without rhododendron. However, on the plots with dense rhododendron cover, tree layer had a positive influence on regeneration within a 1.5 m radius. Natural regeneration density was significantly higher when rhododendron was cleared than the plots without intervention. On the plots without woody clearance, there was an insufficient regeneration (113-619 recruits ha(-1)); however, they had higher mean height compared to the sites without rhododendron. After three and six years of rhododendron clearance, the numbers of recruits in natural regeneration were 63,981 ha(-1)and 105,075 ha(-1), respectively. In conclusion, invasive spread of rhododendron was a limiting factor of the prosperous regeneration and tree species diversity, and manual clearance of rhododendron is recommended in managed beech forests of the study region.

AB  - To obtain insight into perceptions of how fish welfare and health is governed in Norwegian aquaculture, this study investigates three conflict cases: salmon lice, pancreas disease and farm siting. Using surveys and in-depth interviews, it highlights challenges and solutions as perceived from different professional groups. The results show that the current inflexible limit of the number of salmon lice permitted creates frustration, both among the farmers themselves and fish health personnel, and that many advocate means for making the regulations more in line with how much infection pressure a farm creates. The regulators acknowledge that upholding salmon lice regulations may diminish animal welfare. Also, farmers and fish health professionals are concerned about the welfare impact of risky delousing operations. Where pancreas disease is concerned, many express their incredulity that a clearly welfare harming disease is permitted to be endemic in parts of Norway, while a positive diagnosis outside the endemic zone will lead to the fish farmers having to slaughter their fish. The case of farm siting was responsible for less conflict than expected. Few expressed strong opinions, but some asked for an overall plan for farm positioning in order to limit spread of pathogens. All groups expressed a concern in that it is difficult to implement the necessary changes within the present framework. The overall problem seems to be that what is best for the single farmer or company in the short term, is often contrary to the common good and long-term benefit of the industry as a whole.

AB  - Key messageWe provided a complete set of tree- and stand-level models for biomass and carbon content of silver firAbies alba. This allows for better characterization of forest carbon pools in Central Europe than previously published models. The best predictor of biomass at the stand level is stand volume, and the worst are stand basal area and density.ContextAmong European forest-forming tree species with high economic and ecological significance, Abies alba Mill. is the least characterized in terms of biomass production.AimsTo provide a comprehensive set of tree- and stand-level models for A. alba biomass and carbon stock. We hypothesized that (among tree stand characteristics) volume will be the best predictor of tree stand biomass.MethodsWe studied a chronosequence of 12 A. alba tree stands in southern Poland (8-115years old). We measured tree stand structures, and we destructively sampled aboveground biomass of 96 sample trees (0.0-63.9cm diameter at breast height). We provided tree-level models, biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEFs) and biomass models based on forest stand characteristics.ResultsWe developed general and site-specific tree-level biomass models. For stand-level models, we found that the best predictor of biomass was stand volume, while the worst were stand basal area and density.ConclusionOur models performed better than other published models, allowing for more reliable biomass predictions. Models based on volume are useful in biomass predictions and may be used in large-scale inventories.

AB  - The study presents the influence of tree species and soil substrate on the buffer capacity of anthroposols at two afforested postmine sites (Piaseczno and Szczakowa) in southern Poland. These postmine areas were reforested with homogenous stands of tree species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), common birch (Betula pendula Roth), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), European oak (Quercus robur L.), and black alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.), growing on various parent materials (substrates): mixed Quaternary sands and Neogene clays, Neogene clays, Quaternary sands, Quaternary loamy sands, and loams. Samples were taken from the 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 30 cm mineral soil layers. Basic soil properties such as soil texture, total organic carbon content (TOC), hydrolytic acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and base saturation (BS) were investigated. The buffer capacity of the studied soils were measured by the Arrhenius method, and buffer surface areas (alkaline surface area [beta(NaOH)], acid surface area [beta(HCl)], and total buffer area [beta(total)]) were calculated using the definite integral. The highest buffer ability (beta(total)) was seen in stands of alder tree on Neogene clays in the 0 to 5 cm layer and the lowest were noted under pine trees on Quaternary sands in the 5 to 30 cm layer. The examined soils were usually characterized by a higher buffer capacity in the alkaline range than in the acid range. The study showed that the buffer capacity of the surface layers was most affected by the tree species, whereas in the deeper soil layers the capacity was most affected by the soil substrate. Buffer capacity was related to organic matter content (especially TOC and total nitrogen [N] content), soil texture, and sorption properties such as CEC and BS.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts are complex and are influenced by: the spatial distribution of the conflict species; the organisation and intensity of management measures such as zoning; historical experience with wildlife; land use patterns; and local cultural traditions. We have used a geographically stratified sampling of social values and attitudes to provide a novel perspective to the human - wildlife conflict. We have focused on acceptance by and disagreements between residents (measured as Potential Conflict Index; PCI) towards illegal hunting of four species of large carnivores (bear, lynx, wolf, wolverine). The study is based on surveys of residents in every municipality in Sweden and Norway who were asked their opinion on illegal hunting. Our results show how certain social values are associated with acceptance of poaching, and how these values differ geographically independent of carnivore abundance. Our approach differs from traditional survey designs, which are often biased towards urban areas. Although these traditional designs intend to be representative of a region (i.e. a random sample from a country), they tend to receive relatively few respondents from rural areas that experience the majority of conflict with carnivores. Acceptance of poaching differed significantly between Norway (12.7-15.7% of respondents) and Sweden (3.3-4.1% of respondents). We found the highest acceptance of illegal hunting in rural areas with free-ranging sheep and strong hunting traditions. Disagreements between residents (as measured by PCI) were highest in areas with intermediate population density. There was no correlation between carnivore density and either acceptance of illegal hunting or PCI. A strong positive correlation between acceptance of illegal hunting and PCI showed that areas with high acceptance of illegal hunting are areas with high potential conflict between people. Our results show that spatially-stratified surveys are required to reveal the large scale patterns in social dynamics of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - 1. The loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat everywhere on Earth prompts increasing attention to identifying landscape features that support animal movement (corridors) or impedes it (barriers). Most algorithms used to predict corridors assume that animals move through preferred habitat either optimally (e.g. least cost path) or as random walkers (e.g. current models), but neither extreme is realistic.
   2. We propose that corridors and barriers are two sides of the same coin and that animals experience landscapes as spatiotemporally dynamic corridor-barrier continua connecting (separating) functional areas where individuals fulfil specific ecological processes. Based on this conceptual framework, we propose a novel methodological approach that uses high-resolution individual-based movement data to predict corridor-barrier continua with increased realism.
   3. Our approach consists of two innovations. First, we use step selection functions (SSF) to predict friction maps quantifying corridor-barrier continua for tactical steps between consecutive locations. Secondly, we introduce to movement ecology the randomized shortest path algorithm (RSP) which operates on friction maps to predict the corridor-barrier continuum for strategic movements between functional areas. By modulating the parameter Theta, which controls the trade-off between exploration and optimal exploitation of the environment, RSP bridges the gap between algorithms assuming optimal movements (when Theta approaches infinity, RSP is equivalent to LCP) or random walk (when Theta -> 0, RSP -> current models).
   4. Using this approach, we identify migration corridors for GPS-monitored wild reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) in Norway. We demonstrate that reindeer movement is best predicted by an intermediate value of Theta, indicative of a movement trade-off between optimization and exploration. Model calibration allows identification of a corridor-barrier continuum that closely fits empirical data and demonstrates that RSP outperforms models that assume either optimality or random walk. 5. The proposed approach models the multiscale cognitive maps by which animals likely navigate real landscapes and generalizes the most common algorithms for identifying corridors. Because suboptimal, but non-random, movement strategies are likely widespread, our approach has the potential to predict more realistic corridor-barrier continua for a wide range of species.

AB  - Action-based payments that compensate farmers for adopting land-management measures to preserve and enhance the environment have been criticized for being ineffective. The root of the problem is that farmers are not paid for achieving a desired environmental benefit, but compensated for their costs of management. There is growing interest in formulating result-based economic incentives. By paying for an environmental benefit and allowing flexibility in how to achieve it, farmers are given an incentive to exploit their comparative advantages for achieving a desired environmental benefit cost-effectively. However, the feasibility and relative effectiveness of result-based payments for reducing agricultural pollution is contentious. In this study, we designed and evaluated a result-based payment scheme for nonpoint-source pollution abatement from arable land. In a case study in southern Sweden, the cost-effectiveness of the new scheme was compared with that of an existing action-based scheme for vegetated buffer strips to prevent the pollutant, particulate phosphorus, from reaching water resources. The results suggest that result-based payment schemes based on modeled outcomes of pollution abatement are feasible and will considerably improve cost-effectiveness compared to action-based schemes, by relocating buffer strips to where they are more effective and not simply where they have the lowest costs for farmers.

AB  - Transitioning from a fossil economy to a bio-economy will inevitably increase the demand for biomass production. One strategy to meet the demand is to re-cultivate set-aside arable land. This study investigated the climate impact and energy potential of grass-based biogas produced using fallow land in Uppsala municipality, Sweden. The assessment was performed on regional level for more than 1000 individual sites, using the agro-ecosystem model DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) in combination with time-dynamic life cycle assessment methodology. The results showed that the system could significantly increase biogas production within the region, which would reduce the climate impact by 9950 Mg CO2-eq per year. Compared with diesel fuel, the grass-based biogas gave a GWP reduction of 85%. However, the site-specific GWP reduction showed large spatial variability, ranging between 102 and 79% compared with diesel fuel, depending on where in the region the grass was cultivated. Two alternative scenarios were investigated, increased mineral N fertilisation and inclusion of N-fixing crops in the feedstock mixture. The highest mitigation per biogas energy produced was found for the N-fixing scenario but, because of lower yields, this scenario had lower total mitigation potential for the region than the increased fertilisation scenario. The increased fertilisation scenario had a lower climate mitigation effect per biogas energy produced, but the highest mitigation potential when the whole region was considered, because of the increased biogas production. The method applied in this study can guide land-use planning of local energy production from arable land, also for other regions. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cold-water coral LopheJia pertusa is the most common reef framework-forming species in the North Atlantic, which builds complex reef structures supporting a high diversity of benthic species. L. pertusa reef is vulnerable to anthropogenic impact. Mapping L. pertusa distribution is fundamental for resource management, but challenging given the typical remoteness of their habitat. In this study, we used MaxEnt to predict the potential distribution of L. pertusa at the Rost Reef on Norwegian margin, based on terrain variables at multiple scales (30,90 and 170 m). MaxEnt performed well in each of the ten runs, and successfully predicted the potential distribution of L. pertusa at Rost Reef. The suitable habitat of L. pertusa was predicted to occur predominantly on the SW-NE running ridges. Jackknife tests indicated that the terrain variables mean curvature and plan curvature at scale 170 m were the most useful parameters in prediction when used in isolation. The ridge structures at Rost Reef are likely to play an important role in influencing the coral distribution by enhancing the bottom current, therefore beneficial for feeding of the species.

AB  - Buffer zones may reinforce protected areas and are often recommended, but have rarely been systematically studied in temperate forests. Globally, temperate broadleaved forest is considered to be the most disturbed biome, with small, scattered natural fragments. In theory, it is often assumed that nature reserves have heavily exploited surroundings. We tested this assumption using a random sample of 49 small reserves (forest area 5-225 ha) that lacked buffer zones. We expected two major outcomes: either a sharp decline in conservation value from the forest reserves to the surroundings, or a gradient of decreasing value from the reserves and outwards. Basic structural indicators of red-listed forest species were studied in the reserves, in their potential buffers (200 m wide), and in non-protected forests outside the buffers. On average, southern broadleaved deciduous forest covered 37% of the forested area in the reserves, 18% in the potential buffers and 5% in non-protected forest outside the buffers. The density of large living trees (> 40 cm diameter at breast height, dbh) was 30 stems per woodland hectare in the reserves, decreasing to 15 in the buffers, and to 10 outside the buffers. Similar, but less marked gradients, were found for dead standing trees and downed dead wood. The diversity of trees and shrubs indicated relatively high conservation values in the buffers. Valuable reserves had valuable potential buffers, as conservation values of the reserves were positively correlated with those of the buffers. Our results show that heavy exploitation of surroundings cannot a priori be assumed for nature reserves. The results are encouraging for preservation of temperate forest biodiversity, since small reserves seem to be reinforced by their surroundings, but we suggest that protection by law or by other means is necessary to maintain the conservation values of potential buffer zones for the future.

Identifying the resilience of urban bird communities to climate change is critical for making conservation decisions. This study explores the pattern in bird communities across nine European cities and examines the projected impact of climate change in order to detect communities facing a higher risk of functional change in the future. First, generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the potential resilience of urban bird communities in nine European cities and the effects of land cover, latitude, abundance of potential predators (dogs and cats), and bird species richness in each trophic guild. Bird community resilience was represented by an index of functional evenness, because it indicates relatively uniform functional space within the species assemblages. Second, bird community resilience in each city was compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation for the year 2070 to explore potential future threats to conservation. The results showed that community resilience was not significantly associated with land use or abundance of predator. The number of granivorous and granivorous-insectivorous species increases the potential resilience of the community, while the numbers of insectivores, carnivores, and omnivores was negatively correlated with resilience. Of the nine cities, Madrid and Toledo (Spain) are projected to experience the largest change in temperature and precipitation, although their bird communities are characterized by relative high resilience. In contrast, Rovaniemi, at the Arctic Circle (Finland) is projected to experience the second highest increase in temperature among the focused cities, and their bird communities are characterized by low resilience. These findings indicate the importance of future research on the combined effect of functional diversity of species assemblages and climate change on urban biodiversity.

AB  - Subsurface storage of CO2 has a long history on the Norwegian continental shelf; in the Sleipner Field (North Sea) since 1996 and the in Snohvit field (Barents Sea) since 2008. Several studies have pointed out the large carbon storage potential on the Norwegian continental shelf, especially in deep saline aquifers. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has, for the last two years, interpreted relevant data on the Norwegian continental shelf in order to classify potential sites for CO2 storage. The CO2 storage atlas for the Norwegian North Sea indicates possible storage sites, and estimated storage capacity.
   The Utsira Formation is considered to be a part of a saline aquifer together with Skade Formation. The Skade & Utsira Formations are distal deposits in a great delta-complex, with sands coming from the west throughout Miocene and up into the Pliocene. On British sector sands in Miocene are named Hutton sands (informal). To estimate the capacity of CO2 storage in the Utsira formation, a reservoir model covering 1400 km(2) in the south part and located in the Norwegian sector, was built to simulate the long-term behaviour of CO2 injection. The simulations estimated the amount of CO2 which can be injected into the formations. They also illustrated the distribution of the CO2 plume in the reservoir formations.
   With a bottom-hole pressure (BHP) change constraint of 10 bars and no water production, more than 145 Mt CO2 could be injected and stored in the segment model with 4 or 5 injection wells and 50 years injection period. There are no indications that CO2 will migrate to the shallower parts of the formation in the west after 8000 years of simulation. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A clear understanding of processes at multiple scales and levels is of special significance when conceiving strategies for human-environment interactions. However, understanding and application of the scale concept often differ between administrative-political and ecological disciplines. These mirror major differences in potential solutions whether and how scales can, at all, be made congruent. As a result, opportunities of seeking "goodness-of-fit" between different concepts of governance should perhaps be reconsidered in the light of a potential "generality of mis-fit." This article reviews the interdisciplinary considerations inherent in the concept of scale in its ecological, as well as administrative-political, significance and argues that issues of how to manage "mis-fit" should be awarded more emphasis in social-ecological research and management practices. These considerations are exemplified by the case of reindeer husbandry in Fennoscandia. Whilst an indigenous small-scale practice, reindeer husbandry involves multi-level ecological and administrative-political complexities-complexities that we argue may arise in any multi-level system.

AB  - Mosquitoes harbor an extensive diversity of 'insect-specific' RNA viruses in addition to those important to human and animal health. However, because most studies of the mosquito virome have been conducted at lower latitudes, little is known about the diversity and evolutionary history of RNA viruses sampled from mosquitoes in northerly regions. Here, we compared the RNA virome of two common northern mosquito species, Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium, collected in south-central Sweden. Following bulk RNA-sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) of 12 libraries, comprising 120 specimens of Cx. pipiens and 150 specimens of Cx. torrentium, we identified 40 viruses (representing 14 virus families) of which 28 were novel based on phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein. Hence, we documented similar levels of virome diversity as in mosquitoes sampled from the more biodiverse lower latitudes. Many viruses were also related to those sampled on other continents, indicative of a widespread global movement and/or long host-virus co-evolution. Although the two mosquito species investigated have overlapping geographical distributions and share many viruses, several viruses were only found at a specific location at this scale of sampling, such that local habitat and geography may play an important role in shaping viral diversity in Culex mosquitoes.

AB  - We used a simulation model to analyse the effect of continuous-cover forestry on the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from nutrient-rich drained peatland sites in southern Finland. The simulation scenarios were constructed by varying harvesting interval and post-harvest basal area in a typical mature Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) stand. A process-based model of soil organic matter dynamics supplied with some additional empirical routines was used for calculation of emission due to decomposition of fresh litter and peat. The amount and chemical properties of litter inputs, as well as the hydrothermal conditions and the water table depth in the peat layer were used as predictors. We estimated the net ecosystem production as a difference between carbon sequestration in stand biomass and carbon losses due to decomposition of dead organic matter, and the net biome production as the net primary production minus losses due to harvesting. Simulations showed that the peatland forest acted as a carbon sink with low and middle harvest intensity, while it turned into a carbon source with high harvesting intensities. This was mostly because intensive harvesting raised the water table level, thus decreasing tree production and increasing soil methane emission. Carbon dioxide emissions from peat and litter, in turn, correlated negatively with the intensity of harvesting. Correlation of site carbon balance with harvested roundwood indicated that there is a significant trade-off between maintaining carbon in drained peatland forests and providing harvest revenues. The simulations provide novel results and fill a gap of knowledge in ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes in continuous-cover forestry on drained peatlands.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the environmental agenda in Sweden during the last two decades.  A content analysis was made of all articles in a Swedish journal, Miljo-Aktuellt.  Further, to elucidate the evolutionary process of problem formulation and reformulation, two cases were investigated, dealing with the impact of plant nutrients and mercury on surface water quality.  The transport of heavy metals is an essential component of the ecological process and problem of acidification, and similarly, plant nutrients are part of the concept of eutrophication.  Two concepts, the research cycle and the policy cycle, are tentatively applied to the conceptualizations of acidification and eutrophication.  Additional data for the latter part of the study is supplied from parliamentary motions during 1973-1989.
   The substance/media focus of the 1970s was connected to a point-source abatement strategy, which mainly aimed at removing negative effects at a local level.  The development of a national preventive strategy is traced in problem formulations related to "processes" going on in the technosphere:  wastes, noise, energy production, traffic, and toxic substances.  This period lasted from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, and the need for improved resource management as a means to control environmental problems has been a generally accepted idea.  However, this does not mean that measures actually taken are sufficient in a material balance perspective.  Further, in the 1980s there was a strong emphasis upon processes in the ecosphere.  This focus also implies source-related policies.  To a certain extent, the remedies are within the scope of national capabilities, but the international dimension is becoming increasingly important.  Scientific proofs of resource and environment degradation are essential to induce political action and to stimulate international cooperation.  From this study, however, it is not possible to assess the existence of any particular policy-triggering information.

AB  - Existing in suboptimal conditions is a frequent occurrence for species inhabiting the cusp of their ecological range. In range-edge populations of plants, the scarcity of suitable habitat may be reflected in small population sizes which may result in increased self-pollination and/or inbreeding and an increase in the incidence of clonal reproduction. These factors may result in a decrease in levels of genetic diversity and a loss of potential adaptive variation that may compromise species' ability to cope with changes in their environment, an issue that is particularly relevant today with the current concern surrounding global climate change and its effect on species' distributional ranges. In the present study, we have compared the levels of clonal reproduction in the one-sided wintergreen Orthilia secunda (L.) House in (1) populations from its main continuous distribution range, (2) populations occurring on the limits of the continuous range, and (3) peripheral populations outwith the species' continuous distribution range. Range-edge populations in Scotland and Sweden displayed significantly lower genotypic richness and diversity than those from the main area of the species' distribution in these countries. Populations from Ireland, which occur in the temperate zone rather than the boreal conditions that are the preferred habitat for the species, and which represent relict populations left over from cooler periods in the Earth's history, displayed no within-population genetic diversity, suggesting a complete lack of sexual reproduction. Furthermore, the genetic distinctiveness of the Irish populations, which contained alleles not found in either the Scottish or the Swedish populations, highlights the value of 'trailing edge' populations and supports the concept of 'parochial conservation', namely the conservation of species that are locally rare but globally common.

AB  - Unsupervised segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data into wood and leaf is the key to studying forest carbon storage, photosynthesis, and canopy radiation. Further segmentation of wood data into the trunk and larger branch (TLB) and the remaining branch (RB) is of great significance and challenges for dust retention and soil heavy metal enrichment. We proposed an unsupervised, automatic semantic segmentation method based on TLS data of individual trees. The method first performs initial segmentation based on plane fitting residuals and neighborhood normal angle, which can extract smooth and connected regions in the point cloud. Then, the geometric features of segmented clusters are quantified to approximate RB or leaf features. Finally, the segmentation of TLB, RB, and leaf is realized by combining different clusters from bottom to top with geometric features and neighborhood relations. The segmentation performance of our method was evaluated with 104 tree samples from 23 tree species in two open-source datasets from Indonesia, Peru, and Guyana and from Canada and Finland. The microaverage precision of our method is 93.61%. The microaverage recalls of TLB, RB, and leaf are 97.08%, 86.44%, and 89.62%. Compared with the well-known method of separating wood and leaf, our method has 33.56% higher sensitivity, 1.82% higher specificity, 20.52% higher precision, and 0.217 higher F1-score. Besides, we estimated the surface area and volume of TLB, and the surface area and volume of RB based on the segmented data. The above parameters have good consistency compared to those calculated based on manually separated point clouds (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.55-0.93).

We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65 degrees 57'N, 24 degrees 29'E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon), electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p<0.01), and pH (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.

AB  - Above ground dry mass production and N accumulation on an areal basis in stems, branches and needles as well as in litterfall in a Norway spruce stand in south Sweden treated with unlimited availability of water and nutrients (fertilisation with irrigation) or of water (irrigation) during a 6 year experimental period are presented. Fertilisation was made in liquid form on a weekly basis during the vegetation period with 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) during each year. The fertiliser also included a balanced composition of P, K, Ca, Mg and S as well as of micronutrients. Irrigation was carried out as soon as a 20 mm water storage deficit developed. It is concluded that there is a large potential to improve Norway spruce production through liquid fertilisation with irrigation. Stem and branch production of Norway spruce was almost doubled due to this treatment. Also, stand needle dry mass and litterfall were markedly increased in comparison with the control. Water and N availability were the two most limiting growth factors. During the experimental period, irrigation had a greater effect on growth than N addition. The gross N uptake increased by 450 kg ha(-1) as a result of 600 kg ha(-1) fertiliser addition. Needle retention was increased for irrigated trees but needle litterfall remained unchanged. Changing the forest management of Norway spruce to intensive cultivatation results in transitional carbon sequestration in both stand and soil compared with an untreated ecosystem. The largest long-term environmental value is, however, achieved if this cultivated renewable biomass is used as a substitute for fossil fuels. Wood utilisation options of intensively cultivated Norway spruce are discussed.

AB  - ECCSEL, short for European Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure, was proposed by NTNU and SINTEF on behalf of the Norwegian Government, and put on the official European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) Roadmap in December 2008. The mission of ECCSEL is to form a pan-European integrated Research Infrastructure of Centres to build and operate new CCS R&D infrastructures. The ECCSEL will provide a unique integrated infrastructure for the experimental research needed to bring forward improved CCS technology that will be necessary for the implementation CCS on a very large scale globally.
   The mission of ECCSEL is to form a pan-European integrated Research Infrastructure in order to:
   Provide a scientific foundation to respond quickly and systematically to the urgent R&D needs in CCS at a pan-European level
   Maintain Europe at the forefront of the international CCS scientific community
   Increase the attractiveness of the European Research Area, reinforcing the research-based clusters and improving their socio-economic impacts
   Optimise the value and utilisation of public funding to CCS R&D
   ECCSEL will in addition to the development of a laboratory infrastructure also contribute to a unique CCS laboratory access for researchers and students across Europe, which in turn will result in extended research collaboration and activities like joint publications, spin-off products, spin-off companies and new related R&D projects. The shared use of the research infrastructure imply a better utilisation of laboratories and, consequently, many R&D projects do not necessarily need to spend much of their budget for providing the experimental facilities, but can rather increase man-hour efforts.

AB  - The need to integrate non-market ecosystem services into decision-making is widely acknowledged. Despite the exponentially growing body of literature, trade-offs between services are still poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review of published literature in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) on the integration of non-market forest ecosystem services into decision-making. The aim of the review was two-fold: (1) to provide an overview of coverage of biophysical and socio-economic assessments of non-market ecosystem services in relation to forest management; (2) to determine the extent of the integration of biophysical and socio-economic models of these services into decision support models. Our findings reveal the need for wider coverage of non-market ecosystem services and evidence-based modelling of how forest management regimes affect ecosystem services. Furthermore, temporal and spatial modelling of ecosystem impacts remains a challenge. We observed a few examples of multiple non-market services assessments. Integration of non-market services into decision support was performed with either biophysical or socio-economic models, often using proxies and composite indicators. The review reveals that there is scope for more comprehensive and integrated model development, including multiple ecosystem services and appropriate handling of forest management impacts.

AB  - According to the updated Norwegian maritime strategy, its further economic growth will be closely linked with the maritime industry development, which is focused on satisfying the world economy's growing demand for food, energy, and transportation services. Along with supporting the traditional sectors of its maritime industry (offshore hydrocarbon production, fishing, coastal aquaculture, shipping, etc.), Oslo plans to develop some innovative areas of the industry, such as offshore aquaculture, offshore renewable energy and "green" shipping, which are the main research objects of this work. The author presents an analysis of the main innovative projects implemented by Norway in various sectors of its maritime economy. Amid the international community's concern over the global environmental situation, Oslo is actively developing and implementing advanced technological solutions in its maritime industry, which can not only reduce the level of negative impact on the environment, but also significantly improve its economic performance. A key feature of Norway's maritime industry development is the deepening of intersectoral collaboration, which enabled it to implement oil and gas technologies into offshore aquaculture and offshore wind energy, as well as traditional net-pen aquaculture technologies into offshore solar energy projects. Particular attention in the article is paid to the digitalization of Norway's maritime industry, aimed at ensuring automation or, in some projects, complete autonomy of the utilization of different floating and fixed maritime constructions (vessels, offshore fish farms and power plants).Moreover, the author assesses the Norwegian government's efforts in facilitating further maritime industry development, which includes educating specialists in information and communication technologies, expanding international cooperation, implementing public-private partnership programs, searching for new sales markets and revising the state investment system. In conclusion, the author suggests that in the future the global demand for environmentally friendly innovative technologies produced by Norway will increase, thereby providing for new employment opportunities, development of the national maritime industry and, as a result, the country's sustainable economic growth.

AB  - The vast carbon (C) stores in peat soils may be seriously affected by different land-uses, or changes in the prevailing climatic patterns. Land use in peatlands usually includes artificial drainage, Any land-use mediated changes in C emissions from peatlands need to be estimated for greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. This is not an easy task, since all factors that affect the dynamics of litter inputs and decomposition of organic matter are affected, and the changes may be different in different peatland types, or under different climates. This chapter describes an approach for estimating the C balance of peatland forests on site level that combines measured and modelled information on litterfall and decomposition. Further, we outline the most critical data needs. According to our estimates, the soils of boreal peatland forests may act as either net sinks or net sources of C depending on the ratio of litter inputs to decomposition outputs. The dynamics of below-ground litters, especially, and moss litters are most poorly known.

AB  - Policies and planning processes related to land use play an important role in maintaining and developing ecosystem services. The incorporation of ecosystem services into local plans is considered an indicator of the plan's capacity to implement strategic action. This study provides a national overview of the incorporation of the ecosystem service concept in current municipal comprehensive plans in Sweden and explores the actions taken by three municipalities in Stockholm County to implement the ecosystem service concept in practice. A multi-method design was employed including a qualitative content analysis of 231 municipal comprehensive plans, a statistical analysis analyzing temporal changes from 2005-2017, and dialogue meetings with municipal practitioners from the three municipalities. We divided the level of integration to four categories, A (Advanced) D (Not included). Overall, the integration of the ecosystem service concept has significantly increased in municipal comprehensive plans during the last decade. At national level, 23% of municipalities have explicitly mentioned ecosystem services, and within Stockholm County, 42%. The dialogue meetings with municipal practitioners revealed that the municipalities were at different stages of implementing the ecosystem service concept, with diverse actions being implemented for advancing practice. These included capacity building, participatory processes and development of thematic plans and operational documents. To support the future implementation of the ecosystem service concept from vision to action, both local and national initiatives are needed.

AB  - Monetary valuation methods are commonly used to analyze recreation values of water ecosystems. However, most studies on water-related recreation values have not analyzed direct links between ecological elements providing recreation opportunities and user demands. Therefore, we implemented an ecosystem service approach to study human-nature interaction during the actual recreation visit to an urban freshwater site. We developed a conceptual model of local cultural ecosystem services (CES) to study interactions between recreation supply and demand. We were interested in seasonality of water-related recreation supply, and the different demands of summer and off-summer visitors. We chose urban Lake Kuusijarvi in the city of Vantaa, Finland, as our case study area, because it is a popular outdoor recreation area around the year. We identified 14 key elements of the supply of local CES and 22 socio-cultural values for the demand for local CES. We found little seasonal change in recreation supply, but the socio-demographic characteristics and demands of summer and off-summer visitors varied significantly. Demand was higher and more diverse during the summer season, while off-summer visitors were more specific in their demands. Moreover, some visitors feared that some socio-cultural values can be lost if the recreational use of the lake area increases. We discuss our findings in a theoretical context focusing especially on interactions between supply and demand of local CES at Lake Kuusijarvi.

AB  - 1. Escape of cultured organisms into natural ecosystems may threaten wild populations both ecologically and genetically. In the aquaculture industry, farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) often escape and enter the spawning grounds of wild salmon. We report experiments to assess the competitive and reproductive abilities of fifth-generation farmed salmon and their potential impacts upon wild salmon.
   2. The farmed and wild females had similar levels of competitive behaviour; however, they differed in reproductive behaviour and success. Farmed females displayed less breeding behaviour, constructed fewer nests, retained a greater weight of eggs unspawned, were less efficient at nest covering, incurred more nest destruction, and suffered greater egg mortality than wild females. As a result, farmed females had less than one-third of the reproductive success of wild females.
   3. The farmed males were even less successful than the fanned females in competition with the wild fish. They were less aggressive, courted less, partook in fewer spawnings, and achieved only an estimated one to three percentage of the reproductive success of the wild males.
   4. The farmed males exhibited inappropriate mating behaviour, that led to poor fertilization success, even in the absence of competition with wild males.
   5. Adult farmed fish are thus likely to be relatively unsuccessful in natural environments due to a competitive and reproductive inferiority apparently resulting from domestication.

AB  - Models were developed for predicting the decomposition of dead wood for the main tree species in Finland, based on data collected from long-term thinning experiments in southern and central Finland. The decomposition rates, were strongly related to the number of years after tree death. In contrast to previous studies, which have used the first-order exponential model, we found that the decomposition rate was not constant. Therefore, the Gompertz and Chapman-Richard's functions were fitted to the data. The slow initial decomposition period was mainly due to the fact that most dead trees remained standing as snags after their death. The initial period was followed by a period of rapid decomposition and, finally, by a period of moderately slow decomposition. Birch stems decomposed more rapidly than Scots pine and Norway spruce stems. Decomposition rates of Norway spruce stems were somewhat lower than those of Scots pine. Because the carbon concentration of decaying boles was relatively stable (about 50%) the rate of carbon loss follows that of mass loss. Models were also developed for the probability that a dead tree remains standing as a snag. During the first years after death, the probability was high. Thereafter, it decreased rapidly, the decrease being faster for birch stems than for Scots pine and Norway spruce stems. Almost all stems had fallen down within 40 years after their death. In Scots pine and Norway spruce, most snags remained hard and belonged to decay class 1. In birch, a higher proportion of snags belonged to the more advanced decay classes. The models provide a framework for predicting dead wood dynamics in managed as well as dense unthinned stands. The models can be incorporated into forest management planning systems, thereby facilitating estimates of carbon dynamics.

AB  - Biofouling is an ongoing challenge for marine salmon aquaculture, impacting farming operations, fish health and welfare. Current mitigation strategies employed in Norway and Scotland rely mainly on the use of antifouling coatings and reactive removal of biofouling. These approaches are not only costly and of limited efficacy, but also pose active risks and likely contribute to mortality of fish during grow-out at sea. Given the inefficiencies of current biofouling management approaches and the industry's objectives for growth and sustainability, a strategic assessment of future avenues for biofouling management is needed. We here present such an assessment and outline three novel biofouling management strategies that, once implemented, could facilitate improved fish health and welfare, reduced environmental impacts and benefits to the public perception of fish farming. These strategies are based on: (i) efficient antifouling coatings; (ii) antifouling combined with intermittent cleaning; and (iii) grooming of nets. We discuss the advantages, challenges and research and development needs associated with the realisation of these strategies. Drawing on experiences from agricultural systems and invasive species management, we show how the costs involved in the implementation of new strategies will over time be offset by the direct and indirect benefits arising from a reduction in environmental and fish health impacts and an increase in the industry's social licence to operate.

AB  - The impact of litter decomposition on chemical substrate properties and element leaching during early soil formation in afforested post-mine sites and the influence of different tree species are key issues in new ecosystem development. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and common birch (Betula pendula Roth) are important pioneering species used in afforestation of post-mine sites in central and eastern Europe. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of litter decomposition of these species on the chemical properties of mine soil substrates. The impact of litter decomposition on soil properties was tested on quaternary and neogene substrates with different textures (sands, loams, and mixtures of clays and sands) in a controlled incubation experiment using PVC columns. Simulation of precipitation and leaching was undertaken for 10 wk at a temperature of 16 degrees C with distilled water (200 mL wk(-1)) through cylinders with litter, substrate + litter, and control substrate (no litter). Filtrated water solution was collected once a week for laboratory analysis, and the concentrations of dissolved organic C, total N, K, Ca, Mg, and P were determined. The study results indicate a stronger impact of the common birch on the chemical properties of reclaimed mine soils compared with pine. After the experiment, birch litter caused significant changes in pH in quaternary sands, concentration of P in quaternary loams (Ql) and mixtures of neogene clays and quaternary sands (QsNc), exchangeable Ca in QsNc, and Mg in Ql and QsNc compared with pine litter. Birch, in comparison to pine, may affect the intensity of early-stage soil-forming processes by increasing nutrient availability and transport into the soil profile, which may affect the development of soil microbial communities. This process results in different soil properties under the two tree species.

AB  - Timing of ice-out is important to fundamental hydrological and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems at high northern latitudes. While earlier ice-out in lakes during the last century is a well-documented phenomenon across the Northern Hemisphere, local variation in the rate of advancement of ice-out has received little attention. Here, records of ice-out date in 1991-2020 from 37 small lakes in a boreal catchment area in southeastern Finland were used to study variation in the timing of ice-out and its advancement. In addition, data of settling phenology of migratory common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) at the study lakes were used to examine how betweenyear and within-season variation in the timing of ice-out affects lake settlement of the species. Overall, ice-out date (IOD, the timing of ice break-up in the spring) advanced 9.8 days during the 30-year study period, April temperature being more important than winter temperature (severity) in determining the IOD. Rate of the advancement of IOD in individual lakes varied from 1.5 to 16.1 days, having advanced more in relatively larger lakes. Lakes at higher elevations had later mean IOD than lakes at lower elevations. Within-season differences among the lakes in IOD increased from 1991 to 2020, this variation being mainly driven by temperature during the ice melting period. Lakes with late mean IOD were settled later in a season by breeding common goldeneyes than lakes with early IOD. The faster the ice melting progressed within a season, the faster common goldeneyes settled the breeding lakes. The results demonstrate how global warming differently affects IOD in boreal lakes even within the same catchment area. More research in the landscape context is needed to enhance our understanding of changes in IOD in boreal lakes and how differently advancing IOD affects local dynamics of species dependent on open water.

AB  - Using wood as a building material affects the carbon balance through several mechanisms. This paper describes a modelling approach that integrates a wood product substitution model, a global partial equilibrium model, a regional forest model and a stand-level model. Three different scenarios were compared with a business-as-usual scenario over a 23-year period (2008-2030). Two scenarios assumed an additional one million apartment flats per year will be built of wood instead of non-wood materials by 2030. These scenarios had little effect on markets and forest management and reduced annual carbon emissions by 0.2-0.5% of the total 1990 European GHG emissions. However, the scenarios are associated with high specific CO2 emission reductions per unit of wood used. The third scenario, an extreme assumption that all European countries will consume 1-m(3) sawn wood per capita by 2030, had large effects on carbon emission, volumes and trade flows. The price changes of this scenario, however, also affected forest management in ways that greatly deviated from the partial equilibrium model projections. Our results suggest that increased wood construction will have a minor impact on forest management and forest carbon stocks. To analyse larger perturbations on the demand side, a market equilibrium model seems crucial. However, for that analytical system to work properly, the market and forest regional models must be better synchronized than here, in particular regarding assumptions on timber supply behaviour. Also, bioenergy as a commodity in market and forest models needs to be considered to study new market developments; those modules are currently missing.

AB  - With population growth, demand for agricultural products has increased, which affects agriculture, fertiliser use and land management. Due to nutrient inputs from arable areas, the water quality of rivers and lakes near agricultural lands has deteriorated. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are one of the measures used to improve water quality through natural water treatment processes. We studied phosphorus removal in relation to environmental characteristics in five in-stream free surface flow CWs in Finland, Estonia and Latvia. Wetland/catchment area ratios varied from 0.1% to 5%. Three CWs were covered in dense vegetation. On average, the Va center dot nda CW and Hovi CW TP removal efficiency throughout the study period were highest (32.1 +/- 3.6% and 34.9 +/- 4.4%, respectively) among all studied CWs. Nummela Gateway CW, Rantamo-Seitteli CW and Mezaciruli CW showed lower TP removal efficiency and on many occasions the outflow concentration exceeded the inflow concentration in Rantamo-Seitteli and Mezaciruli CW. Vegetation cover emerged as the most important factor in the treatment efficiency of in-stream CWs, reducing flow rate, increasing water retention time and decreasing probability of the CW becoming a source of phosphorus during flood events.

AB  - The present study was focused on how cardinal directions inside gaps of different sizes (small, 200 m(2); medium, 400 m(2); and large, 600 m(2)) can affect soil characteristics and tree regeneration. Additionally, the effects of gap size on the growth dynamics of trees outside the gaps were evaluated. The study was carried out in a European beech stand located in Aspromonte National Park (Southern Apennines, Calabria, Italy). Microclimatic variables, physical, chemical, and biochemical soil properties, natural regeneration density, and growth trees outside the gaps density of natural regeneration were assessed. This study provided evidence for an important effect of cardinal points on micro-environmental parameter variability, nutrient cycle, physic-chemical soil properties, water availability, and biological processes such as trees growth and regeneration. The European beech natural regeneration was most abundant in the south part of the gaps. Thus, we can state that cardinal points affect the trees natural regeneration in a species-specific manner. The new microclimatic conditions due to the gap opening had positive effects on the tree growth located along the gap edge, especially in the trees sampled on the edges of the medium gaps. On the contrary, the trees located in the forest recorded a productivity coherent with the period prior the gap opening. In medium-sized gaps, the combination and interaction of microclimatic and soil parameters (humification and mineralization process and microbial activity) created the best conditions for beech natural regeneration and favored an increase in the productivity of the trees at the edge of the gaps.

AB  - The effect of stand age on biodiversity in the stands of Populus tremula, a keystone tree species in boreal forests, has been insufficiently studied, although this knowledge is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in managed forests. We studied the assemblages of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens from a chronosequence of aspen stands (n = 20) with an age from 8 to 131 years, aiming to identify the main patterns in species richness and composition.
   Altogether, 72 vascular plant species were found in the field layer and 17 species in the shrub layer. The total numbers of bryophyte and lichen species were 92 and 104, respectively. Overall, 2 vascular plant, 12 bryophyte and 9 lichen species were the taxa with a high conservation value. Sixteen lichens were regarded as management sensitive or focal species based on earlier studies, and 10 vascular plant species were hemeraphobic (severely disturbed by human activities).
   The effect of stand age on average species richness estimates depended on the studied species groups. Stand age had a negative effect on the average number of vascular plants, field layer species, apophytic vascular plants and epixylic lichens and a positive effect on the number of lichens, the number of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens and on bryophytes and lichens with a high conservation value.
   The compositional patterns of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens strongly correlated with stand age. In addition, stand characteristics, soil properties and light conditions influenced the assemblages, although the direct effects were variable for different groups. The largest differences could be observed in vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen communities between young and old stands; for lichens, also mature and old stands differed significantly.
   Our results indicate that more than 60 years are required for the recovery of some species groups after clear cutting. At the same time, other species groups were either not negatively affected by clear-cutting or showed a higher richness in younger stands. Therefore, we conclude that the management of aspen stands should involve the combination of different management regimes on the landscape scale (variation from short to long rotations in different stands, maintaining retention trees and ceasing of clear-cutting in some stands). Our results also show that as second-storey Tilia cordata played an important role in maintaining biodiversity in the studied stands, this tree species needs to be preserved in forests where lime trees naturally grow as co-dominants.

AB  - This paper evaluates the potentials of landscape and recreational values trading (LRVT), a system of payments for ecosystem services, as a vehicle to simultaneously preserve recreational environments for the nature-based tourism business and enhance welfare in rural communities. Ruka-Kuusamo in northeastern Finland serves as a case region for the ex ante evaluation. A novel evaluation framework of the study focuses on technical feasibility, institutional context, and potential surplus of LRVT to ecosystem service provision and social capital. The evaluation data from four years action research comprise surveys and group interviews with ecosystem service providers (forest owners) and buyers (tourism entrepreneurs and tourists), complemented with newspaper articles, forest data, and meeting minutes of local authorities. The results show tension between general acceptance and practical readiness to start LRVT. Several institutional challenges need to be solved before adopting LRVT in the region. Ambiguous understanding on the impacts of forest management to landscape and recreation value, deeply institutionalised norms among the forestry community, and hidden agendas may make it difficult to achieve considerable and sustainable improvements in the quality of ecosystem services. This paper concludes with discussing elements of LRVT that may be functional and provide positive returns to recreation values of the area and to social capital inside the community. Several years of research intervention and public discussion have now resettled the network of local actors to a promising position that shows capacity to co-create functional local forest governance, including possibly a publicly or privately organised LRVT system.

AB  - The project Baltic Phytoremediation (BAPR), an implementing project of the Interreg South programme, aims to raise cross-border awareness about the availability of green phytoremediation technologies to remove environmental pollutants from soil or water, such as oil, industry-related contaminants, hazardous substances, heavy and toxic metals, nutrients and microplastics, through new arenas of cooperation that focus on circular economy approach. Contamination of land and soil increases and is a serious concern around the Baltic Sea region but further worldwide. The most common remedial technologies for related to the clean-up of soil is excavation, removal and disposal to a contained landfill. Therefore, heavily contaminated soils in landfills, can in some instances, mixing with another disposal of hazardous materials. In the Kalmar, a region of south-eastern Sweden, on the Baltic Sea, the glass waste dumps are removed in such old fashion way with no contribution towards the Circular Economy. The best available remediation strategy is soil washing strategy, an ex-situ technology with a chemical additive application to remove contaminants from the soil and wastewater. Recently, many studies have been carried out encouragingly the phytoremediation processes in different plant species. For instances, food crops, sunflower and Indian mustard are considered as the best plants for phytoremediation, as they have a role in phytoextraction of heavy metals. Phytoremediation research has gained the interest of the scientific society and governments over the last two decades, leading to the development of urban greening and ecology national parks. Orrefors park is one of the largest innovative urban site parks in Sweden with ecologically, socially and economically sustainable way with phytoremediation. The present project aims to explore the combination of phytoextraction with biomass generation and commercial utilization as an energy source, using the ash (bio-ore) that increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. The project includes pilot cases using innovative plant-based phytoremediation methods that cleaning of the contaminated soil.

AB  - The predicted increase in the number of urban flood events can result in substantial monetary losses to society. These costs may be alleviated by preserving ecosystem services, such as urban runoff management. We studied the monetary value of this ecosystem service by applying the replacement cost method in six catchments with varying land-use intensities in two cities in Finland. The economic analysis was based on metric data of urban runoff generation, provided by automatic monitoring stations in the catchments. A hydrological model was applied to estimate evaporation from impervious surfaces, and to simulate runoff in the catchments. Our results suggest that leaving green space unconstructed results in significant monetary savings. The cost of managing runoff correlated with land-use intensity. The ecosystem service value (ESV) was generally higher in catchments with high land-use intensity, low proportion of green space, and high costs of runoff management. Depending on the degree of imperviousness, the ESV ranged from 90,000-270,000 (sic)ha(-1). Further, our results suggest that estimates of runoff generation and evaporation are key hydrological factors for assessing ESV. Our study demonstrates how the combination of field data and hydrological and monetary analyses can support regional planning in cold climates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing boreal forests for effective climate change mitigation requires comprehension of the full spectrum of climate regulation services that they provide, which includes both the storage of carbon and exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere. It is increasingly recognized that surface albedo is the most important biogeophysical mechanism by which the boreal forest directly influences the global energy balance. Forest management decisions that influence age class and species distributions affect not only the carbon sink capacity, but also the albedo (and hence climate services) of the forested landscape. Disregarding albedo and how it is influenced by management decisions can have profound implications for the effectiveness of any climate change mitigation policy involving active forest management. Here, we explore, analyze, and compare the albedo predicted by simple empirical models with in situ and remotely sensed albedo observations in regions outside the region in which the models were originally developed (southeastern Norway), including boreal Canada and Europe. We find that the models are robust in their ability to predict the longer term interannual trends in the mean winter-summer albedo amplitude, the rapid albedo evolution in young stands, and the timing of seasonal transitions and weak with respect to capturing interannual albedo changes linked to seasonal climate variability and phenology.

AB  - In this work, the investment required to apply CO2 capture to large-scale industrial sources is assessed and discussed in a case study of Sweden - a highly industrialized region with relative proximity to large and well-documented storage sites in the Norwegian North Sea. The Swedish process industry is characterized by a large share of biogenic emissions, and therefore has a considerable Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) potential. The capital cost for CO2 capture is estimated for a standard MEA-based CO2 absorption process. The CO2 absorption process is applied to several industries - pulp and paper, oil and gas, steel, cement and chemical production - and dimensioned using process modeling. The equipment cost is subsequently estimated using a detailed individual factor estimation method. The capture costs are compared to estimates of the cost for transport and storage.

AB  - The ecosystem services literature rests on the premise that an increased understanding of ecosystems, ecosystem services and, in particular, the value of ecosystem services will feed to decision-making. Yet, there is little evidence for the assumed demand and applicability of valuation knowledge in real-life policy and decision-making processes, and the use of such knowledge has received little in-depth analytical attention. Motivated by these observations, we have conducted an empirical analysis of ecosystem service value knowledge use. Our analysis of policy actors' experiences and expectations regarding value knowledge in Finland's peatland policy draws on ten interviews with eleven policy actors. Focusing on the usefulness and uses of valuation knowledge, we analyze the ways in which values are framed and value knowledge is expected to influence the rights to use ecosystem services. Our analysis shows that policy actors expect a better understanding of ecosystem service values to support the consideration of benefits. Yet, what they view as crucial knowledge needs aligns with their sectoral or organizational position as well as the interests they represent. Hence, valuation does not provide a solution to distributional debates or conflicts over rights, but it can have an important function as the provider of background knowledge.

AB  - Ecosystem budgets of matter contribute to the assessment of transport and accumulation of biclavailable contaminants in a landscape, since flows of matter and energy ultimately determine the rates at which contaminants will be partitioned in the environment. This study compares ecosystem properties, such as net primary production (NPP), sequestration of matter and fluxes to food sources for humans, which are of potential interest to describe fluxes and accumulation of bioavailable radionuclides in 14 catchments within a larger catchment area in southeast Sweden. The carbon budgets, used as a proxy for organic matter, are mainly based on local estimates of pools and fluxes, which have been distributed across a landscape mosaic of different vegetation types and management regimes using a geographical information system (GIS). NPP varied by a factor close to two (432 - 709 g.C.m(-2.)y(-1)), while net ecosystem production ranged between -124 and 159 g(.)C(.)m(-2.)y(-1) for the different catchments. Carbon sequestration mainly occurred in the vegetation while the soil organic carbon pool was mainly a source of carbon. Large herbivores consumed on average 4.5 % of the above-ground green tissue production. When arable land was present in the catchment, the flux of carbon to humans was highest from crops and, in decreasing order, milk and beef, followed by the flux from hunting and berry/fungus picking. The results can be used to estimate the potential assimilation of radionuclides in vegetation and the potential exposure to humans of bioavailable radionuclides.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

AB  - While ecosystem-based planning approaches are increasingly promoted through international and national policies, municipalities are still struggling with translating them into practice. Against this background, this paper aims to increase the knowledge of current advances and possible ways to support the implementation of the ecosystem services (ES) approach at the municipal level. More specifically, we analyze how ES have been integrated into comprehensive planning within the municipality of Malmo in Sweden over the last 60 years, a declared forerunner in local environmental governance. Based on a content analysis of comprehensive plans over the period 1956-2014 and interviews with municipal stakeholders, this paper demonstrates how planning has shifted over time toward a more holistic view of ES and their significance for human well-being and urban sustainability. Both explicit and implicit applications of the ES concept were found in the analyzed comprehensive plans and associated programs and projects. Our study shows how these applications reflect international, national, and local policy changes, and indicates how municipalities can gradually integrate the ES approach into comprehensive planning and facilitate the transition from implicit to more explicit knowledge use.

AB  - 1. Hydropower is often presented as a clean and renewable energy source that is environmentally preferable to fossil fuels or nuclear power. Hydropower production, however, fundamentally transforms rivers and their ecosystems by fragmenting channels and altering river flows. These changes reduce flow velocity and the number of rapids, and reduce or alter wetland, floodplain and delta ecosystems. Dams disrupt dispersal of riverine organisms and sediment dynamics and may alter riverine biodiversity composition and abundance. Freshwater ecosystems now belong among the world's most threatened ecosystems.
   2. Water managers are beginning to recognise the need to combine demands for social and economic development with the protection of the resource base on which socioeconomic benefits rely. Environmental flows can help to balance ecosystem and human needs for water, both when constructing new dams and in re-licensing existing dams.
   3. We briefly review the impacts of hydropower generation on freshwater ecosystems by discussing different types of dams and development, and by providing examples from Sweden of how environmental effects of hydropower production could be mitigated. Special emphasis is given to flow regulation through re-operation of dams.
   4. Regulated rivers in Sweden were developed with little consideration of ecological effects, with most dams lacking migration pathways or minimum flow releases. There is thus a substantial potential for improvement of ecological conditions, such as naturalisation of flow regimes and reestablishment of connectivity, in regulated river reaches but technical hurdles imply major challenges for rehabilitation and mitigation. Most regulated rivers consist of cascades of consecutive reservoirs and impoundments, further constraining possible actions to improve ecological conditions.
   5. Most environmental mitigation measures require flow modifications to serve ecosystems, implying reduced power production. An important challenge for river management is to identify situations where measures involving relatively small production losses can have major ecological advantages.
   6. Climate change during the 21st century is expected to increase runoff in northern and central Sweden and make the annual hydrograph more similar to variation in electricity demand, i.e. a lower spring flood and increased run-off during winter months. This could provide opportunities for operating dams and power stations to the benefit of riverine ecosystems. On the other hand, demands to produce hydropower are likely to increase as fossil fuels are phased out, leading to increased pressures on free-flowing rivers and aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Knowing the historical variation in fire regimes is instrumental in managing forests today and in predicting what may happen in the future. By cross--dating 745 fire scars in 378 samples of remnant Scots pines, we delineated 254 individual forest fires during the past 700 years in a 74-km(2) section of Trillemarka-Rollagsfjell Nature Reserve in south-central Norway. Fire sizes, numbers, burn rates, and frequencies were compared with historical -climate proxies, vegetation maps, and written sources. The results revealed patterns consistent with a predominantly climate-driven fire regime up to 1625, followed by periods of strong anthropogenic influence that increased fire frequency during 1600-1700s and diminished fires during 1800-1900s. This was documented by an abrupt increase in number of small fires from the early 1600s that markedly shortened fire intervals from a median of 73 to 37 yr. This shift in fire frequency coincided with a sudden appearance of early-season fires from 1625 and onward. Whereas late-season burn rate increased with summer temperature, no such relationship was found for early-season fires. These results were corroborated by written sources that describe anthropogenic forest fires and slash-and-burn cultivation expanding with the increasing population from the late 1500s and subsequently diminishing due to increasing timber values during 1700-1800s. Whereas human activity strongly influenced the fire regime at multidecadal to centennial scales, it was the interannual variability in climate that triggered large fire events, especially during the pre-1625 period. Prior to 1625, the percentage of years with fire tripled from 7% during cold summers (10-12 degrees C) to 21% during warm summers (14-16 degrees C). Burn rate increased even more, from 0.01% to 1.3% for the same temperature intervals. Ecologically, the post-1625 period is remarkable in such a way that human activity, first by greatly increasing fire frequency and subsequently almost eradicating fires, possibly influenced the fire regime to such an extent that it may be unprecedented for millennia.

AB  - The promotion of conservation agriculture (CA) for smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa is subject to ongoing scholarly and public debate regarding the evidence-base and the agenda-setting power of involved stakeholders. We undertake a political analysis of CA in Zambia that combines a qualitative case study of a flagship CA initiative with a quantitative analysis of a nationally representative dataset on agricultural practices. This analysis moves from an investigation of the knowledge politics to a study of how the political agendas of the actors involved are shaping agrarian practices. From its initial focus on CA as soil conservation and sustainable agriculture, the framing of the initiative has evolved to accommodate shifting trends in the policy arena. In tandem with the increased focus on climate adaptation, we see an increased emphasis on private sector-led modernisation. The initiative has shifted its target group from the poorest smallholders to prospective commercial farmers, and has forged connections between its farmer-to-farmer extension network and private input suppliers and service providers. The link between CA and input intensification is reflected in national statistics as a significantly higher usage of herbicides, pesticides and mineral fertilizer on fields under CA tillage compared to other fields. We argue that the environmental and participation agendas are used to buttress CA as an environmentally and socially sustainable agricultural development strategy, while the prevailing practice is the result of a common vision for a private sector-led agricultural development shared between the implementing organisation, the donor and international organisations promoting a new green revolution in Africa.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - Background: Native cattle breeds are important genetic resources given their adaptation to the local environment in which they are bred. However, the widespread use of commercial cattle breeds has resulted in a marked reduction in population size of several native cattle breeds worldwide. Therefore, conservation management of native cattle breeds requires urgent attention to avoid their extinction. To this end, we genotyped nine Swedish native cattle breeds with genome-wide 150 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the level of genetic diversity and relatedness between these breeds.
   Results: We used various SNP-based approaches on this dataset to connect the demographic history with the genetic diversity and population structure of these Swedish cattle breeds. Our results suggest that the Vane and Ringamala breeds originating from southern Sweden have experienced population isolation and have a low genetic diversity, whereas the Fjall breed has a large founder population and a relatively high genetic diversity. Based on the shared ancestry and the constructed phylogenetic trees, we identified two major clusters in Swedish native cattle. In the first cluster, which includes Swedish mountain cattle breeds, there was little differentiation among the Fjall, Fjallnara, Swedish Polled, and Bohus Polled breeds. The second cluster consists of breeds from southern Sweden: Vane, Ringamala and Swedish Red. Interestingly, we also identified sub-structuring in the Fjallnara breed, which indicates different breeding practices on the farms that maintain this breed.
   Conclusions: This study represents the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the genetic relatedness and diversity in Swedish native cattle breeds. Our results show that different demographic patterns such as genetic isolation and cross-breeding have shaped the genomic diversity of Swedish native cattle breeds and that the Swedish mountain breeds have retained their authentic distinct gene pool without significant contribution from any of the other European cattle breeds that were included in this study.

AB  - Globally, biodiversity offsetting is used to balance negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services caused by exploitation. In Sweden, there is an increasing interest in biodiversity offsetting in urban planning. However, there is limited understanding about the use of the concept in a municipal context. This study aims to examine and critically reflect on the uptake and use of biodiversity offsetting at a strategic level in urban planning in Sweden. We study urban planning documents, and included Sweden's 290 municipalities in the study. The result shows that more than 50% of Sweden's municipalities mention biodiversity offsetting in their planning documents, targeting both regulatory offsetting of protected areas and voluntary offsetting of urban green space. The uptake is highest in urban areas experiencing high exploitation pressure, and many munici-palities include both biodiversity and ecosystem services in their strategic work with offsetting. Most munici-palities do not relate to the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore, offset), nor the goal of no net loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. There is an ambiguity in the translation between losses and offsets, i.e. what type of offsetting (like-for-(un)like), what replacement ratios, and where to place the offsets. Few municipalities have developed processes, guidelines, strategic plans, etc., to integrate offsetting into the planning process. We conclude that the uptake of biodiversity offsetting is substantial, but with a fragmented, and often immature use in relation to ecological knowledge, and the planning process. We argue that, to develop biodiversity offsetting into an approach that delivers sound outcomes for nature and people in urban planning, municipalities must have a capacity in terms of organisational structures and resources.

AB  - The boreal forest environment plays an important role in the global C cycle due to its high carbon storage capacity. However, relatively little is known about the forest fungal community at a regional scale in boreal forests. In the present study, we have re-analyzed the data from our previous studies and highlighted the core fungal community composition and potential functional groups in three forests dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Finland, and identified the fungal generalists that appear across geographic locations despite differences in local conditions. The three forests represent subarctic, northern and southern boreal forest, and are all in an un-managed state without human interference or management. The subarctic and northern areas are subject to reindeer grazing. The results showed that the three locations formed distinct fungal community structures (P < 0.05). Compared to the two northern locations, the southern boreal forest harbored a greater abundance of Zygomycota, Lactarius, Mortierella Umbelopsis, and Tylospora, in which aspect there were no differences between the two northern forests. Cortinarius, Piloderma, and Suillus were the core fungal genera in the boreal Scots pine forest. Functionally, the southern boreal forest harbored a greater abundance of saprotroph, endophytes and fungal parasite-lichen, whereas a greater abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi was observed in the northern boreal forests. Moreover, the pathotroph and wood saprotrophs were commonly present in these three regions. The three locations formed two distinct fungal community functional structures, by which the southern forest was clearly separated from the two northern forests, suggesting a distance-decay relationship via geographic location. This study provides useful information for better understanding the common fungal communities and functions in boreal forests in different geographical locations.

AB  - This study determined values for the ecosystem services of abandoned coppice forests that are threatened by a forest disease known as Japanese Oak Wilt. We applied a discrete choice experiment to value these ecosystem services. The results indicated that ecosystem services were highly valued in the order of biodiversity conservation, water and soil regulation, timber provision, and climate change mitigation. This study suggests that people expect abandoned coppice forests to be protected from Japanese Oak Wilt and to become rich in biodiversity. However, public preference for biodiversity conservation services had high heterogeneity among people. On the other hand, water and soil regulation services were widely ranked as important among people. Furthermore, traditional management method is most preferred than other forest-change scenarios in JOW countermeasures.

AB  - The postglacial (ca. 13 000 BP) vegetational and climatic history is reconstructed from the pollen analytical study of the sediments of two lakes located in coastal northern Gaspe Peninsula. J'Arrive Lake (altitude: 56 m) was submerged by the Goldthwait Sea until about 11 400 BP. Euloge Lake, 83 m in altitude and less than 1 km from the shore, escaped the marine invasion. Before 10 400 BP, the vegetation, very scarce at first, evolved to a herb tundra that lasted for over a millenium. A cold climatic oscillation correlative with the Younger Dryas is identified at both sites between 10 700 and 10 400 BP, during this herb tundra phase. After 10 400 BP, dwarf birch and willows colonized the sites, leading to a shrub tundra. The afforestation of the area began only around 9300 BP, with the late arrival of spruce and aspen. This phase was interrupted at 8650 BP by the upsurge of green alder, in response to another cold oscillation. Since 7250 BP, the present forested landscape finally developed in three steps, characterized by (i) a high diversity of forest species until 2500 BP, (ii) a loss of diversity until 1000 BP that favoured spruce and balsam fir, and (iii) an increase of heliophilous trees, shrubs, and herbs. These reconstructions contribute to the late-glacial palaeogeography of Eastern North America through the unravelling of conditions close to the retreating ice.

AB  - At least 10% of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction and pathogens are increasingly implicated in tree threats. Coextinction and threats to affiliates as a consequence of the loss or decline of their host trees is a poorly understood phenomenon. Ash dieback is an emerging infectious disease causing severe dieback of common ash Fraxinus excelsior throughout Europe. We utilized available empirical data on affiliate epiphytic lichen diversity (174 species and 17,800 observations) among 20 ash dieback infected host tree populations of F. excelsior on the island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, Sweden. From this, we used structured scenario projections scaled with empirical data of ash dieback disease to generate probabilistic models for estimating local and regional lichen coextinction risks. Average coextinction probabilities ((A) over bar) were 0.38 (95% CI +/- 0.09) for lichens occurring on F. excelsior and 0.14 (95% CI +/- 0.03) when considering lichen persistence on all tree species. (A) over bar was strongly linked to local disease incidence levels and generally increasing with lichen host specificity to F. excelsior and decreasing population size. Coextinctions reduced affiliate community viability, with significant local reductions in species richness and shifts in lichen species composition. Affiliates were projected to become locally extirpated before their hosts, illuminating the need to also consider host tree declines. Traditionally managed open wooded meadows had the highest incidence of ash dieback disease and significantly higher proportions of affiliate species projected to go extinct, compared with unmanaged closed forests and semi-open grazed sites. Most cothreatened species were not previously red-listed, which suggest that tree epidemics cause many unforeseen threats to species. Our analysis shows that epidemic tree deaths represent an insidious, mostly overlooked, threat to sessile affiliate communities in forested environments. Current conservation and management strategies must account for secondary extinctions associated with epidemic tree death.

AB  - 1. Crop diversification has been introduced as an environmental strategy in the 'Greening' of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 2015-2020. The primary target of crop diversification is soil and ecosystem resilience, but claims for potential benefits for farmland biodiversity are also common. However, understanding of relationships between the number (compositional heterogeneity) and spatial arrangement (configurational heterogeneity) of crop fields and biodiversity is generally poor, making such claims relatively unfounded.
   2. In this study, we monitored crop and farmland bird diversity on 178 farms across Sweden's main agricultural areas. From a pre-implementation assessment, we show that > 97% of the assessed farms would not be required to change their management under the CAP crop diversification measure (minimum of three crops for farms with 30+ ha), suggesting that this measure has generated little change on Swedish farms.
   3. While accounting for non-crop elements and farming system (conventional or organic), we show that crop structural diversity (i.e. the management and vegetation structure of crops) rather than crop diversity senso lato positively affected richness of non-crop breeding bird species with stronger effects in arable, compared with forest-dominated landscapes. No such effects were observed among field-nesting farmland bird species.
   4. Organic farming had little influence on farmland birds with positive effects only in the most arable-dominated landscapes and for field-nesting species only. In forest-dominated landscapes, organic farms even held lower field-nester densities compared with conventional farms, possibly due to the dominance of grasslands on organic farms that in these landscapes support lower densities of field-nesting species compared with cereals.
   5. Policy implications. Our study illustrates the importance of a consideration of structural instead of species diversity of crops for biodiversity, in this case farmland birds. We also underline the absence of such a distinction in current EU Common Agricultural Policy Greening, while simultaneously setting levels on crop diversification too low resulting in little to no change in landscape-scale crop diversity on Swedish farmland. We recommend that future efforts to manage farmland biodiversity should include ways of increasing the structural diversity of crops at the scale of farms and landscapes.

AB  - Many landscape and biotic processes shape the genetic structure of populations. The genetic structure of species with parasitic stages may also depend on the life history and ecology of their host. We investigated population genetic structure of the mussel Margaritifera margaritifera in Southern Sweden, and in relation to the population size and life history of its hosts, Salmo trutta and S. salar. Mussel populations were genetically differentiated into two clusters, further subdivided into four clusters and distinct conservation units. Regardless of host species, the genetic differentiation was lower among mussel populations sustained by sea-migrating than by resident hosts, while the genetic diversity was higher in mussel populations sustained by sea-migrating than by resident hosts. Genetic diversity of mussel populations was positively related to host abundance. Mussel population size was positively related to high genetic diversity of mussels sustained by resident hosts, while low mussel population size sustained by sea-migrating hosts had a high genetic diversity. The results of our study suggest a combined influence of mussels and host fish on genetic structure of unionoid mussels. We suggest to conserve not only mussel population sizes and host fish species, but also consider host migratory/resident behaviour and abundance when designing conservation programs.

TI  - Importance of spruce swamp-forests for epiphyte diversity and flora on Picea abies in southern and middle boreal Finland
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
LA  - English
AB  - The epiphyte (lichens and bryophytes) species richness, diversity and composition on basal trunks of Picea abies in spruce swamp-forests were compared to adjacent mesic forests on mineral soil in two southern and two middle boreal sites in old-growth forest patches in Finland. The sampling was carried out along four line transects parallel to swamp-forest margin: 1) in the spruce swamp-forest, 2) at the swamp-forest margin, 3) on mineral soil c. 10-20 m off the swamp-forest margin and 4) on mineral soil at least 50 m off the swamp-forest margin. In the two southern boreal sites there was a decreasing trend in the average species number per tree from the trees in swamp-forests (21-25 species) to the trees on mineral soil (17-18 species). whereas in the two more humid and virgin middle boreal sites a similar trend was not detected (25-28 species on all trees). There were no major differences in the epiphyte flora between the locations or study sites; the dominant species occurred on nearly all sample trees. The crustose lichens Cliostomum leprosum. Arthonia leucopellaea and Lecanactis abietina were the most common species that were mainly confined to the swamp-forests in the southern boreal sites, C. leprosum also in the middle boreal sites. In addition, several rare species occurred exclusively on the swamp-forest trees. Lecanactis abietina extended significantly higher on the swamp-forest trees than on the trees on mineral soil in the southern boreal sites. The spruce swamp-forests proved to be one of the most important habitats for maintaining the epiphyte diversity in the boreal forest landscape.

AB  - The European pine marten Martes martes is often associated with late seral stage coniferous forest stands. Earlier research has indicated that this species may be negatively influenced by clearcutting practices. However, the effects of current clearcutting methods on pine marten occurrence in conjunction with changing environmental conditions are not well known. In this study, we combined four complete years of nationwide data collected during a long-term camera trap (CT) monitoring program in Norway. We employed a multi-scale occupancy model to investigate the relationship of pine marten occurrence to clearcuts (regenerating stands & LE; 10 years old) and forests & GE; 120 years old. We also examined pine marten detection in relation to habitat features (i.e. dominant microsite characteristics) and to varying snow depths and temperatures. We found no relationship between pine marten occurrence and the proportions of old forest and clearcuts at the landscape scale. At the habitat-patch scale, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with the presence of old forest patches and terrain ruggedness, but not with clearcuts & LE; 100 m from sites. At CT sites near clearcuts, the detection probability was negatively correlated with snow depth. In contrast, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with snow depth at CT sites > 100 m from clearcuts. Furthermore, the detection probability increased with temperature and the presence of boulders at CT sites. Boulders may provide important access points for foraging, and cover for resting and predator avoidance. While previous studies indicate that pine martens prefer older forest and avoid clearcuts, the current level and scale of clearcutting in Norway does not appear to influence its occurrence at the landscape scale.

AB  - Fire history and stand structure was examined in twelve virgin forest stands situated within forest reserves in northern Sweden. The selected stands represented fire refuges as well as different successional stages after fire. Six of the stands were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karat.), three were dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and three were dominated by hairy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) or aspen (Populus tremula L.). In 3 of the southernmost stands, the average fire interval was 34 to 65 years during the late 1600s to late 1800s, but since 1888 no fires had occurred in any of the stands. The absence of fire disturbance since 1888 is probably caused by the fire suppression in the overall landscape. The standing volume of living trees ranged between 87 and 511 m(3) ha(-1) while the volume of dead trees, including both snags and logs, ranged between 27 and 201 m(3) ha(-1). The volume of dead trees constituted ca. 30% of the total stem volume. In the conifer dominated stands, there was a statistically significant relationship between total stem volume, including both living and dead trees, and site productivity. A comparison between the amount of dead and living trees indicated substantial changes in tree species composition in several stands. It is suggested that data on the amount of dead trees, especially logs, and its distribution over decay classes could be used to examine the continuity of certain tree species. All stands had a multi-sized tree diameter distribution, which in most cases was similar to a reversed J-shaped distribution. In general spruce was numerous in the seedling cohort and in small diameter classes, indicating that its proportion in the stands was stable, or was increasing at the expense of pioneer tree species such as pine, aspen and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The most numerous species in the seedling cohort, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), was almost totally missing in the tree layer, indicating a high browsing pressure preventing rowan seedlings from growing into trees. The general increase of spruce and the sparse regeneration of pioneer species, in the stands previously affected by fire, are discussed in relation to natural disturbance regimes, biological diversity and nature conservation policies. It is proposed that reintroduction of fire disturbance is a necessity for future management plans of forest reserves. Other management practices to increase species diversity within forest reserves are also discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Swedish forestry has successfully developed systems for sustained yield production of wood. Silvicultural techniques are today completely dominated (96%) by clear-felling methods. By contrast, Swedish natural forests and preindustrial cultural woodlands were ecologically and culturally diverse, with a substantial proportion having a continuous tree cover as a response to natural disturbance dynamics and preindustrial agricultural land management. If forest management systems do not mimic this diversity of disturbance regimes sufficiently well, the scope of sustainable forest management to include biodiversity and sociocultural values will not be met. This study estimated the past and present amount of one cultural and two natural disturbance regimes known to deliver continuous tree cover in two study areas located around two important biophysical and sociocultural transition zones in northern and southern Sweden, respectively. Several approaches were used to estimate the amount of remaining continuous tree cover forests. The results indicate that 9-10% of the study areas is made up by site types that historically would have held a large proportion of continuous tree cover forests. Estimates for productive site types show that only 1-2% of these sites remain in southern Sweden and 10-20% in northern Sweden. The data indicate that present management in both study areas is similar. Thus, these differences between the regions will disappear in a few decades. To achieve the aim of Swedish forest and environmental policies there is a clear need to develop and use alternative forest management methods on appropriate sites.

AB  - Kaartvedt distinguished between drifting and resident plankton and hypothesized that the latter were distinguished by their ability to maintain their horizontal position in desired habitats (Kaartvedt, 1993). In this study, we examined the population genetic consequences of these two Lifestyles for copepods in four fjords of western Norway (Lurefjorden, Masfjorden, Sognefjorden and Sorfjorden) and one fjord in eastern Norway (Oslofjorden). Based on DNA sequence variation of a region of mitochondrial 16S rRNA, we contrasted population genetic diversity and structure in drifting populations of Calanus spp. with that of resident populations of Acartia clausi. With the exception of Sorfjorden (where Calanus spp. were rare), two or three species of Calanus co-occurred in significantly different proportions in the fjords. Based on a 350 base-pair region of mitochondrial 16S rRNA, Calanus spp. varied in molecular genetic diversity, with the highest values for C. helgolandicus. There was no evidence of significant genetic structure of fjord populations for either C. finmarchicus or C. helgolandicus; the population structure of C. glacialis could not be evaluated as the species was only abundant in Lurefjorden. Acartia clausi was abundant in all five fjords sampled for this study. Molecular genetic diversity of A. clausi, based on a 220 bp region of mt 16S rRNA, was within the range of Calanus spp. values. Populations of A. clausi showed significant genetic structure (i.e. haplotype frequencies differed markedly) among the fjords. The results of this study indicated that little exchange (gene flow) occurs between populations of A. clausi in different fjords, and suggested that the populations are longterm residents of a fjord. In contrast, most Calanus spp. fjord populations may be replaced periodically, as they drift with currents flowing to and from coastal and fjord environments.

AB  - This article analyses how urban densification, primarily in relation to ecosystem services, is addressed in comprehensive plans from three cities in southernmost Sweden: Malmo, Lund and Helsingborg. The aim was to investigate and problematise how the comprehensive plans articulate and negotiate how to build dense cities while preserving and enhancing ecosystem services. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the comprehensive plans in use during the study period. The comprehensive plans were all ambitiously formulated. However, three recurrent issues were found. Planners struggled to address the issue of scale: Ecosystem services in the city were addressed when planning for densification, while ecosystem services for the city were either omitted or mentioned in the passing. The timeframe in relation to sustainable urban development was also not clarified. Most importantly, there were profound unclarities regarding priorities. Densification was suggested to provide all positive qualities simultaneously, including enhancing and supporting ecosystem services, which is, from a systems viewpoint, not possible. We suggest that when planning for sustainable cities, based on best available research, politicians should bring the prioritisation process to the fore, to clarify and address how to plan for dense, healthy cities with functioning ecosystem services in a more holistic manner.

AB  - This paper explores the ecosystem services provided by anadromous brown trout (often termed sea trout) populations in Norway. Sea trout is an important species in both freshwater and marine ecosystems and provides important demand-driven ecological provisioning and socio-cultural services. While the sea trout once provided an important provisioning service through a professional fishery and subsistence fishing, fishing for sea trout in the near shore coastal areas and in rivers is today a very popular and accessible recreational activity and generates primarily socio-cultural services. The recreational fishery contributes to local cultural heritage, its folkways and lore, to the development and transfer of local ecological knowledge and fishing experience to the young and to human well-being. As a salmonid species, the sea trout is sensitive to negative environmental conditions in both freshwater and marine coastal areas and is in general decline. A recent decision to expand production of farmed salmon may increase pressure on stocks. Good management of recreational fishing is accordingly important for the species to thrive, but knowledge of what fishers value with respect to fishing sea trout and what management measures they will accept is limited. Researchers sought to capture information about non-extractive direct use value (non-monetary) of the sea trout recreational fishery using questionnaire surveys targeting Norwegian anglers around the country. Results indicate that the most important ecosystem services delivered by recreational sea trout fisheries are social-cultural ecosystem services at the level of individual fishers; fishing sea trout most likely also has important social functions. Fishers are prepared to accept stricter management measures that reduce catches and allow fishing to continue but they oppose paying higher fees.

AB  - Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (CCAMS) are changes to the management of production forests motivated by the need to mitigate climate change, or adapt production forests to climate change risks. Sweden is employing CCAMS with unclear implications for biodiversity and forest ecosystem services (ES). Here, we synthesized evidence from 51 published scientific reviews, to evaluate the potential implications for biodiversity and a range of provisioning, regulating, and cultural ES, from the adoption of CCAMS relative to standard forestry practice. The CCAMS assessed were the adoption of (i) mixed-species stands, (ii) continuous cover forestry, (iii) altered rotation lengths, (iv) conversion to introduced tree species, (v) logging residue extraction, (vi) stand fertilization, and (vii) altered ditching/draining practices. We highlight the complexity of biodiversity and ES outcomes, identify knowledge gaps, and emphasize the importance of evidence-based decision making and landscape-scale planning when navigating choices involving the widespread adoption of CCAMS.

AB  - Sweden aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources, ultimately to be able to phase out fossil fuels. To achieve this, new energy sources need to be explored. In this multi-disciplinary article, we examine the technical, economical, ecological and legal possibilities to commercially and sustainably harvest brushwood for bioenergy, while simultaneously gaining positive environmental effects, both for biological diversity, the cultural heritage, and the climate.
   The Swedish open landscape is becoming covered with secondary brushwood regrowth through natural succession, except where it is kept open. Brushwood is spreading along roads, railway lines, edge zones, in power line corridors, abandoned semi-natural grasslands, nature reserves, and in marginal land in urban areas. Such brushwood consists of saplings, bushes and young trees of a range of deciduous plant species, e.g. birch, aspen, alder and goat willow, sometimes mixed with conifers, often forming dense thickets.
   Such secondary brushwood regrowth could be systematically utilised as a new source of renewable bioenergy. Commercial brushwood harvesting in Sweden may contribute 26 PJ of energy annually, which may be a small but significant contribution, considering the favourable energy ratio (E-r = 28), indicating that large emission reductions can be achieved, if fossil fuels are replaced. Growing brushwood does not require fertilizers or pesticides, soil tillage or crop management, and it does not compete with any other potential land use. Many brushwood habitats are already being managed to clear brushwood, for other purposes, minimizing the added harvesting cost.
   Apart from providing bioenergy, it has also been suggested that brushwood harvesting would benefit biological diversity. A large number of nationally redlisted species are dependent on the active management of open habitats, including semi-natural grasslands, and man-made habitats such as road verges and power line corridors.
   Our literature review shows that brushwood harvesting could benefit both biological diversity and the cultural heritage, and contribute to the management of the open cultural landscape. There are however certain limitations. Brushwood harvesting would favour a certain set of species, including many redlisted, but it may also threaten another set of species, especially species associated with early successional stages of forest regeneration, as well as forest edge species, depending on how and where it is applied. Harvesting may be affected by legislation imposing limitations regarding habitats of particular importance for biodiversity. The environmental and legal constraints would probably reduce the profitability of brushwood harvesting in certain areas, as well as the annual production of bioenergy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We provide a review of the environmental threats and gaps in monitoring programmes in European coastal waters based on previous studies, an online questionnaire, and an in-depth assessment of observation scales. Our findings underpin the JERICO-NEXT1 monitoring strategy for the development and integration of coastal observatories in Europe and support JERICO-RI2 in providing high-value physical, chemical, and biological datasets for addressing key challenges at a European level. This study highlights the need for improved monitoring of environmental threats in European coastal environments.
   Participants in the online questionnaire provided new insights into gaps between environmental threats and monitoring of impacts. In total, 36 national representatives, scientists, and monitoring authorities from 12 European countries (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, UK) completed the questionnaire, and 38 monitoring programmes were reported. The main policy drivers of monitoring were identified as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Regional Seas Conventions (e.g. OSPAR), and local drivers. Although policy drivers change over time, their overall purposes remain similar. The most commonly identified threats to the marine environment were marine litter, shipping, contaminants, organic enrichment, and fishing. Regime change was identified as a pressure by 67 % of respondents. The main impacts of these pressures or threats were identified by the majority of respondents (> 70 %) to be habitat loss or destruction, underwater noise, and contamination, with 60 % identifying undesirable disturbance (e.g. oxygen depletion), changes in sediment and/or substrate composition, changes in community composition, harmful microorganisms, and invasive species as impacts.
   Most respondents considered current monitoring of threats to be partially adequate or not adequate. The majority of responses were related to the spatial and/or temporal scales at which monitoring takes place and inadequate monitoring of particular parameters. Suggestions for improved monitoring programmes included improved design, increased monitoring effort, and better linkages with research and new technologies. Improved monitoring programmes should be fit for purpose, underpin longer-term scientific objectives which cut across policy and other drivers, and consider cumulative effects of multiple pressures.
   JERICO-RI aims to fill some of the observation gaps in monitoring programmes through the development of new technologies. The science strategy for JERICO-RI will pave the way to a better integration of physical, chemical, and biological observations into an ecological process perspective.

AB  - Tree species may affect diversity of soil microbial communities in afforested post-mining barrens. The objective of this study was to compare community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) of microbial communities in O horizons and uppermost mineral layers of mine soils under the pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula pendula), larch (Larix decidua), alder (Alnus glutinosa), and mixed pine-alder and birch-alder forest stands. The physiological abilities of soil microbial communities were studied using the Biolog (R) test. Physiological diversity was calculated as Shannon's index (H') based on the Biolog (R) data. There were significant vegetation-dependent differences in CLPPs with the larch and birch stands supporting microbial communities with distinct physiological profiles. The soil microbial communities under these stands used less efficiently carbohydrates and were characterized by lower CH/AA ratio. The differences in CLPPs were limited to O horizon, in the mineral soil the effect of tree species was much less pronounced. Admixture of alders to birch and pine stands did not result in consistent increase of physiological diversity of soil microbial communities. However, the microbial communities under pure larch stand were significantly less physiologically diverse which may suggest worse functioning of microbial communities under pure larch plantations.

AB  - 1. The effect of water level drawdown after drainage of mires for forestry was studied by comparing the vegetation on undrained pine-mire sites with that of sites drained 3-55 years earlier. The plant communities were analysed with respect to the following environmental variables: drainage age, total nutrient contents of surface pear, and tree stand characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to data on the botanical composition of vegetation.
   2. Two main gradients were found in the data. The first ordination axis clearly relates to a gradient in forest vegetation succession and the second axis to a gradient in peat nutrient level and pH.
   3. The secondary succession towards forest vegetation started soon after drainage and proceeded most rapidly in the most nutrient-rich site types. This led to a more uniform vegetation composition between the site types.
   4. Original mire species reacted differently to the changing post-drainage environment. Tall sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, C. rostrata) disappeared soon after drainage. The coverages of the mire dwarf shrubs gradually decreased with increasing tree stand volumes; Betula nana appears to have been the most sensitive species. The coverages of the Sphagna studied appear to have decreased in response to increasing tree stand shading in the order: S. fuscum > S. recurvum complex > S. magellanicum > S. russowii.
   5. The development towards forest vegetation on mires may diminish the regional (gamma-) diversity on forest-dominated landscapes, even if the species (alpha-) diversity on individual sites is little affected.
   6. Long-term vegetation changes after artificial water level drawdown, emphasized in this study, can be used to mimic the effects of the predicted global climatic warming on mire vegetation.

AB  - In order to integrate ecosystem services (ES) in designing agri-environmental policy, we investigated both the demand for, and supply of, ES from agricultural environments in Finland. Using the discrete choice experiment method, we measured citizens' willingness to pay (WTP) for four different ES and analysed farmers' compensation request (willingness to accept [WTA]) for producing these services. Biodiversity and water quality gathered the highest WTA of farmers, but also the highest WTP of citizens. Overall, the average WTA exceeded the WTP for almost all attributes and levels, but 20-27 per cent of farmers were willing to produce the ES with the compensation lower than citizens' WTP.

AB  - To circumvent problems associated with even-aged, pure coniferous stands propagated outside their natural range alternative management strategies and conversion programs are currently discussed in Central Europe. However, a mainstreaming of such adapted silvicultural systems with climate change mitigation objectives is missing to date. In this study the objective was to assess in situ C storage under conditions of climate change in a secondary Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest management unit in Austria. Four management strategies (Norway spruce age class forestry, transition to continuous cover forestry with Norway spruce, conversion to mixed conifer/broadleaved stands, no management) were investigated under current climate and two transient climate change scenarios in a simulation study. By comparing the results of two independent forest ecosystem models (PICUS v 1.41, 4C) applied under identical forcings and boundary conditions we aimed at addressing uncertainties in model-based projections. A transition to continuous cover forestry increased C storage in all climate scenarios (+45.4 tC.ha(-1) to +74.0 tC-ha(-1) over the 100 year analysis period) compared to the approximately balanced C budget under the age class system. For the mixed conifer/broadleaved management variant predictions of the two models diverged significantly (+29.4 tC.ha(-1) and -10.6 tC.ha(-1) in PICUS and 4C respectively, current climate). With regard to climate change impacts both models agreed on distinct effects on productivity but lower sensitivity of C stocks due to compensation from respiration and adaptive harvest levels. In conclusion, considering the potential effects of silvicultural decisions on C stocks climate change mitigation should be addressed explicitly in programs advocating targeted change in management paradigms.

AB  - Arctic soils are an important reservoir of soil organic carbon (SOC) and their role in determining arctic ecosystem functioning in global carbon budgets requires closer attention. We investigated the coupling of soil properties and SOC stabilization mechanisms in high Arctic terrestrial habitats differing in vegetation cover and organic matter input. We focused on soil physical and chemical properties in glacier foreland, soil crust, dry tundra, wet tundra, and bird cliff meadow habitats on Svalbard (Norway). Concurrently, we performed physical fractionation to determine the amount of SOC stabilized by mineral associations or occlusion in macro and microaggregates. Initial stages of soil development (glacier foreland and soil crust habitats) exhibited characteristically high bulk density and pH, and low moisture and nutrient contents, whereas more developed soils (dry and wet tundra habitats) showed opposite trends. Contrastingly, bird cliff meadow showed low bulk density, intermediate moisture, and very high nutrient content. The amount of SOC stabilized by mineral associations and occlusion in aggregates generally increased with vegetation cover; hence, the more developed habitats supported higher contents of stabilized SOC. However, SOC was stabilized in aggregates even in initial stages of soil development. SOC content in most fractions correlated positively with contents of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, suggesting that both dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen might have provided some degree of SOC stabilization through increased formation of aggregates and suppression of microbial mineralization of soil organic matter, respectively. Our findings underscore the notion that models of SOC sequestration in the Arctic should account not only for total SOC content, but also SOC stabilization mechanisms, as represented by SOC content in respective soil fractions.

AB  - Semi-automated fluorescent genotyping of eight polymorphic microsatellite loci was used to assess the level of genetic diversity and population differentiation in Nordic stocks of non-anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, of both wild and hatchery origin. Highly significant genetic heterogeneity was detected globally across wild and/or hatchery populations and even between populations from lakes separated by as little as six kilometres. The overall level of genetic differentiation among wild populations (F(ST) = 0.360) was substantially higher than that observed between populations of anadromous Arctic charr in Canada using microsatellite data. Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance was used to construct a neighbour-joining tree and three population clusters were supported with relatively high bootstrap values which included the populations from north-west, north-east and southern Finland respectively. Use of Paetkau et al's individual assignment rest further supported the strong differentiation of most populations as well as their classification into the three predicted geographical areas. No significant difference in average allele number or heterozygosity was observed between populations of wild and hatchery origin. However, the effects of hatchery rearing were revealed by a strong increase in the number of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as well as of linkage disequilibrium events in the hatchery stocks compared to natural populations. The population from Lake Saimaa; in south-cast Finland, is completely reliant upon aquaculture assistance for its survival. The broodstocks of this population exhibited particularly low levels of genetic variability. Although the hatchery stocks of this population suffer from increased egg and alevin mortality and disease susceptibility, it remains to be determined if this is due directly to a lack of genetic variation as some abundant unstocked natural populations possessed similarly low levels of microsatellite variability.

AB  - Finland is a cold country in northern Europe. The indigenous sources for the generation of power and heat are hydro, wood and peat. Almost one third of the country's area are peatlands totalling some 10 million hectares.
   Currently the area reserved for peat production is 132,000 hectares and half of it is in active use. During the short summer season about 7 million tonnes of peat is produced. This amount covers 6,5% of the total primary energy demand in Finland. Feat has the specific CO2 emission of 104-106 g/MJ, which is of the same order of magnitude as wood. The accumulation of peat and hence the sequestering of carbon in the Finnish peatlands exceeds the current use of peat for energy and horticultural purposes. The total CO2 emissions of peat utilization are 8 million tonnes while the sequestering of the CO2 in pristine and for forestry ditched peatlands is 11-20 million tonnes.
   Feat production is conducted at about 300 individual sites all over the country. These sites are located in rural areas where the unemployment rate is usually high. Feat creates directly and indirectly about 6000 job opportunities in Finland.
   Feat is used for power and heat generation in CHP plants of the inland cities. As long as the annual accumulation of peat exceeds the use of peat, the resource is used in a sustainable manner.

AB  - This introduction to the Special Issue summarizes the results of 14 scientific articles from the interdisciplinary research program Ekoklim at Stockholm University, Sweden. In this program, we investigate effects of changing climate and land use on landscape processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, and analyze issues related to adaptive governance in the face of climate and land-use change. We not only have a research focus on the 22 650 km(2) Norrstrom catchment surrounding lake Malaren in south-central Sweden, but we also conduct research in other Swedish regions. The articles presented here show complex interactions between multiple drivers of change, as well as feedback processes at different spatiotemporal scales. Thus, the Ekoklim program highlights and deals with issues relevant for the future challenges society will face when land-use change interacts with climate change.

AB  - Adaptive and multi-level governance is often called for in order to improve the management of complex issues such as the provision of natural resources and ecosystem services. In this case study, we analyse the contemporary multi-level governance system that manages water resources and its ecosystem services in a fresh water lake in Sweden. We assess the relative importance and barriers of three commonly highlighted components of adaptive governance: "feeding ecological knowledge into the governance system", "use of ecological knowledge to continuously adapt the governance system", and "self-organisation by flexible institutions acting across multiple levels". Findings reveal that the trickiest aspect of adaptive governance capacity to institutionalise is the iterative nature of feedbacks and learning over time, and that barriers to the spread of knowledge on social-ecological complexity through the governance systems are partly political, partly complexity itself, and partly a more easily resolved lack of coordination. We call for caution in trusting crisis management to build more long-lasting adaptive capacity, and we conclude that a process of institutionalising adaptive capacity is inherently contingent on political process putting issues on the agenda.

AB  - The level of genetic diversity maintained in a population is determined by the combined action of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift and selection. Forest tree breeding is a relatively recent phenomenon compared to most crop species and the material that is being deployed is, genetically, often very similar to wild-growing populations. The introduction of vegetative propagation has been hailed as a more efficient and flexible method than seed orchards to rapidly realize breeding progress and to adapt material to future climate change. What remains unclear is how a large deployment of vegetatively propagated material may affect the patterns of genetic diversity within and among forest stands. Here we review what is currently known about genetic diversity in managed and natural forest stands and specifically address the impacts of clonal forestry. To assess this we develop a quantitative model to describe the consequences of clone deployment on genetic and genotypic diversity in Swedish forests. We conclude with some remarks specific to Swedish conditions, likely scenarios for clonal deployment and finally some suggestions for future research priorities.

AB  - Since the industrial revolution, atmospheric nitrogen deposition has increased strongly and has been shown to alter nitrogen cycles, species composition and diversity in many ecosystems, including forests. At the same time, nitrogen removal from forests through biomass extraction via historical management techniques has decreased considerably. A proven tool to analyze the effects of long-term environmental changes are vegetation resurveys. In this study, we tested whether environmental changes resulting from atmospheric nitrogen deposition and altered forest management are reflected in the vegetation composition of temperate forest understories in six acidophilic and oligo-mesophilic forest types in south-western Germany. We compared historical surveys from 1950 to 1976 with surveys from 2017/18 and examined changes in the vegetation using NMDS ordinations and Ellenberg indicator values. While an increase in the number of nitrophilic species was detected in all forest types, only the acidophytic and oligotrophic Vaccinio-Abietetum and Luzulo-Quercetum forests (dominated by Abies alba (Mill.) and Quercus spec., respectively) exhibited a replacement of oligotrophic species by nitrophilic species, amounting to an overall trend of eutrophication. Despite the uncertainties resulting from different plot locations and the slow dynamics of forests, we demonstrate a significant trend in the understory vegetation composition, which is likely caused by atmospheric N deposition. Differences in the sensitivity of different forest types indicate an influence of geological and climatic site characteristics and historical land use on the effects of environmental changes.

AB  - In even-aged clear-cutting forestry, the biodiversity effects of treatments must be well understood for proper forest management and conservation. While biodiversity on clear-cuts has been much studied, other common forestry stages such as thinning have received less attention. We studied saproxylic beetles, a highly diverse group with many red-listed species, in young spruce stands 2-5 years after pre-commercial thinning. This intervention often creates sun-exposed dead wood, also of deciduous trees such as birch, potentially favoring many of these beetle species. To help evaluate this forestry stage, we compared the saproxylic beetle fauna of 10 thinned spruce stands with that of 10 geographically matched semi-natural woodland key habitats (WKHs) in Sweden. Local and overall species numbers of saproxylic beetles were similar in the two forest types, but they differed in species composition. Compared with WKHs, thinned stands had an overall lower number of species on deciduous wood, fungivorous species, and red-listed or previously red-listed species. Between-stand diversity was also lower for thinned than for WKH stands. Thus, while pre-commercially thinned spruce forests hosted many saproxylic beetle species, including some red-listed ones, WKHs provide habitat for a more variable fauna, especially for beetle groups of conservation concern. Woodland key habitats, although small, are a valuable complement to young production forests of spruce for the conservation of saproxylic beetle species.

AB  - Environmental impacts of salmon cage aquaculture resulting from deposition of organic-rich particulate matter to the sea bottom have been thought to be a function of the local environmental conditions and management practices. However, testing of these suppositions have been limited by (1) widely varying monitoring methods employed, and (2) lack of data comparability resulting from the absence of standardized national monitoring schemes.
   In order to determine the sensitivity of different monitoring methods in detecting benthic environmental effects, a comparative analysis was undertaken of four methods commonly employed in Norway that vary in cost and expertise required: (1) visual diver surveys, (2) faunal analysis, (3) sediment chemistry, and (4) Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI). Results indicate that all methods agreed in the common "impact zone" under and immediately next to the cages. However, each of the methods differed in their sensitivity in detecting more subtle effects at greater distances from the cages.
   Data from 168 environmental survey samples located at various distances from working Norwegian salmon cage farms collected using similar methodology between 1996 and 1998 were analyzed to determine the relationship between environmental variables, management regimes, and levels of environmental impact. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in sediments were significantly higher immediately adjacent to cages compared to reference sites, and approximately 32% of the samples under the cages showed significant degradation. At intermediate distances (50-100 m), influences from fish farming are not clearly detected by TOC analysis. Further, while neither depth nor current speed alone are good predictors for environmental management, the results suggest recovery of sites by periodic abandonment (or fallowing) is one of the best management tools for sustainable salmon fanning in cold-water environments.

AB  - Ophiostomatoid fungi can severely affect the health and economic value of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies). Although the diversity of ophiostomatoid species and their associations with insects have been well-investigated in central and northern Europe, little is known about the conditions in south-eastern Europe.
   This study aims to study the assemblages of ophiostomatoid fungi associated with three bark beetle species (Ips typographus, Ips amitinus, and Pityogenes chalcographus) that infect Norway spruce in Slovenia.
   Bark beetles were sampled in four phytogeographic regions in Slovenia. The fungi found on the bark beetles were identified based on morphology, DNA sequence comparisons of ITS regions and phylogenetic analysis. The species compositions of the fungal associates of the three insect species were compared and the pairwise associations of the occurrence of the fungal species were analysed.
   Thirteen different species were found. The most commonly encountered fungal associates of the beetles were Ophiostoma bicolor, Ophiostoma brunneo-ciliatum, Grosmannia piceiperda, Ophiostoma ainoae, Ceratocystiopsis minuta, and Grosmannia penicillata. The composition of the fungal associates differed among the bark beetle species, but not among the phytogeographic regions.
   This study confirms that ophiostomatoid species are common associates of the investigated bark beetle species. Many ophiostomatoid species have strong host associations. I. typographus and P. chalcographus can act as effective vectors for O. bicolor, O. ainoae, G. piceiperda and O. brunneo-ciliatum, whereas I. amitinus often carries G. piceiperda and C. minuta in Slovenian forests.

AB  - The Bialowieza Forest (BF) is in many respects an exceptional object, of a great importance for nature protection and forest management, at the international scale. The BF plays also a key role from the point of view of regional development and welfare of local community. In the last period, a big threat for multiple values of the BF has arisen, as a result of enormous bark beetle infestation, which started in 2012 and has killed 1.4 million m(3) of spruce trees. In the paper, first, a brief overview of the general history of the BF and an account of long-term human impacts on its functioning and structure is provided. Next, the history of bark beetle infestations in the BF is analysed. It is shown that, in the period 1992-2007, the average volume of spruces killed by bark beetle amounted on average to 20,000 m(3) of wood annually. During that period practically all dead trees were removed from the forest by means of salvation cuttings. Starting from 2008, more and more trees infested by European spruce bark beetle were left in the forest, in a result of a pressure exerted by environmental groups. In 2012, Minister of Environment decided to reduce the allowable cut, determined in forest management plans elaborated for the managed part of the BF, from 107,000 to 48,500 m(3)/year. This decision, along with several other regulations and restrictions, made in practice impossible to stop the development of a current bark beetle infestation, which started in 2011 and intensified during the next 6 years (solely in 2016 bark beetles killed 480,000 m 3 of spruce trees). In the paper, the most important implications and consequences of the current situation are briefly summarized and discussed. A special attention is given to the problems concerning: 1) protection of Natura 2000 species and sites (endangered by bark beetle outbreak), 2) a negative influence of large amounts of spruce deadwood on forest soils, 3) threats caused by pathogenic fungi, 4) question of public safety, 5) fire hazard, and 6) economical dimension. The legal and socio-economical foundations of the functioning of Hajnowka, Browsk and Bialowiezka forest districts comprising the managed part of the BF, as well as their most important environmental and social consequences are discussed too. Among others, it is indicated that, under current conditions of the BF, human intervention plays a key role in maintaining stable and compositionally diverse woodland communities. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are provided, aimed at, in the short term, breaking off the current bark beetle outbreak, and, in the long term, at maintaining a multifunctional character of the BF and its ability to provide all important ecosystem services on a sustainable basis.

AB  - Purpose of Review We give an overview of economic drivers and consequences of diversification in forest management. Starting with formal portfolio-theory analyses of the optimal forest composition, we review other, often-disregarded factors that influence diversification. A special focus of our review is the interrelation between economic diversification and multifunctionality, asking if optimal economic diversification supports increased levels of multiple ecosystem services as a positive externality.
   Recent Findings Analyses considering economic diversification in forest management mainly build on Markowitz' theory of portfolio selection, which is essentially a statistical theory. They emphasize that the economic diversification of forest composition, regeneration and/or thinning strategies, quality of timber logs, or age classes can significantly reduce risks. Further studies assume that risk-averse landowners will provide benefits for the society as a by-product of their management strategies, because economic diversification is usually associated with enhanced biodiversity and higher levels of multiple ecosystem services.
   Summary We identify drivers and consequences of economic diversification that have been seldom addressed in previous studies. These include the aim to achieve subsistence, to balance site-dependent marginal economic return among various stand types, to utilize synergistic effects between mixed tree species and to achieve averaging effects over time (time diversification). Another important factor influencing and influenced by diversification is multifunctionality, because economic diversification alone does not necessarily automatically provide a larger range of uncertain ecosystem services. Consequently, future research could extend classical portfolio approaches to multi-objective, robust optimization.

AB  - This paper concerns predicting enrollment in payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs to promote habitat preservation on private lands. We develop a beta-binomial model to address both program participation and the amount of land enrolled by each potential enrollee. We apply the estimation approach to stated preference data from non-industrial private forest owners in Finland. As an alternative econometric model, we also develop a multivariate censored regression model of enrollments. Using cross-validation, we find that the beta-binomial model predicts at least as well as the multivariate censored model yet has fewer parameters. Using our estimation results, we demonstrate policy predictions regarding program enrollment and landowner opportunity cost.

AB  - Forest biomass measurement or estimation is critical for forest monitoring at the stand scale, but errors among different estimations in stand investigation are unclear. Thus, the Pinus densata natural forest in Shangri-La City, southwestern China, was selected as the research object to investigate the biomass of 84 plots and 100 samples of P. densata. The stand biomass was calculated using five methods: stand biomass growth with age (SBA), stem biomass combined with the biomass expansion factors (SB+BEF), stand volume combined with biomass conversion and expansion factors (SV+BCEF), individual tree biomass combined with stand diameter structure (IB+SDS), and individual tree biomass combined with stand density (IB+SD). The estimation errors of the five methods were then analyzed. The results showed that the suitable methods for estimating stand biomass are SB+BEF, M+BCEF, and IB+SDS. When using these three methods (SB+BEF, SV+BCEF, and IB+SDS) to estimate the biomass of different components, wood biomass estimation using SB+BEF is unsuitable, and root biomass estimation employing the IB+SDS method was not preferred. The SV+BCEF method was better for biomass estimation. Except for the branches, the mean relative error (MRE) of the other components presented minor errors in the estimation, while MRE was lower than other components in the range from -0.11%-28.93%. The SB+BEF was more appealing for branches biomass estimation, and its MRE is only 0.31% lower than SV+BCEF. The stand biomass strongly correlated with BEF, BCEF, stand structure, stand age, and other factors. Hence, the stand biomass growth model system established in this study effectively predicted the stand biomass dynamics and provided a theoretical basis and practical support for accurately estimating forest biomass growth.

AB  - Power line clearings are edge-creating disturbances in landscapes world-wide, but there have been few studies on their bordering vegetation. Our aim was to quantify edge effects on plant communities along such clearings in Norway and to identify factors that influence these edge effects. We surveyed understorey plant communities on either side of the power line clearing-forest edge at 51 sites, along four parallel transects at each site. Each transect had four plots located, respectively, in the clearing centre, clearing edge, forest edge and forest. We quantified the magnitude of edge effects (MEE) on either side by comparing edges with their corresponding non-edge' reference habitats. We also measured differences in species composition across the edge (clearing edge vs. forest edge). Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. Differences in species composition were greater between clearing centres and clearing edges than between forests and forest edges. Differences in species composition across the edge increased with edge contrast and forest productivity. Edge effects on species composition into the forest were smallest along north-facing edges, whereas those in the clearings increased with power line age. Species richness increased slightly towards the edge in forests but decreased considerably towards the edge in clearings. The direction and MEE on either side differed among functional groups. Edge contrast and edge aspect were the prime factors influencing the MEE into forests, whereas in clearings, these were influenced principally by tree regrowth in the clearings and by forest productivity.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects on plant communities bordering power line clearings were determined by factors that can be influenced by planners and managers. For existing power lines, management plans should differentiate between the following: (i) clearings through high conservation value forests, where edge effects into the adjacent forest should be limited; (ii) clearings that can act as replacement habitat for cultural landscape species, where maintaining open-canopy habitats should be prioritized; and (iii) business-as-usual' clearings, where continuing the current practice of cutting every 5-10years is recommended.

AB  - Background: In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition?
   Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
   Review findings: During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests.
   Conclusions: The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies. Therefore, generalization of the results must be done carefully.

AB  - Outbreaks of bark beetles, for example Ips typographus L. in Eurasia or Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins in North America, have serious impacts on forest resources, biodiversity, and ecological dynamics, with economical and social ramifications. Moreover, many models predict increasing frequency and severity of such biotic disturbances due to ongoing climate change, and land use driven changes in forest structure and composition. Bark beetles are recognized as keystone species due to their strong and complex effects on ecosystem dynamics. However, due to the increasingly widely recognized biogeomorphic impacts of trees, bark beetles may have significant indirect biogeomorphic and pedogenetic impacts through their effects at scales ranging from individual trees to forest landscapes. These include: (1) Reduced uprooting, with associated impacts on topography, mass movements, regolith and soil formation, and slope hydrology; (2) Reductions in bioprotection via trapping of downslope sediment movement; (3) Hydrological impacts, including increased total runoff and increased proportion of subsurface flow; (4) Decreased microtopographic irregularity (and associated hydrological and pedological impacts); and (5) Changes in biochemical and biomechanical effects on soils, regolith, and hillslope morphology. Five separator factors (discriminators between different developmental trajectories) were revealed for the case of the central European region. These factors may determine the occurrence and severity of biogeomorphic impacts: First is whether the site is prone to potential uprooting or whether an spruce bark beetle (SBB) outbreak is initiated by a blowdown/uprooting event. Second is whether the site is dominated by mineral soils or Histosols. A third discriminating factor is whether the forest is managed or unmanaged, which determines the pre-attack tree species composition and coarse woody debris and disturbance regimes; and a fourth is the post-outbreak management. Finally, the fifth separator factor relates to slope thresholds that determine the significance of impacts on mass movements and erosion. These findings support the need, and provide guidelines, for research on geomorphic impacts of bark beetle infestations. Though we mainly restrict our consideration to bark beetles in Europe, both our approach and findings are likely to have broader relevance for biogeomorphic impacts of extensive tree mortality.

AB  - Understanding the relative contributions of the environment to commercial fisheries and aquaculture systems is an area of intense importance as it quantifies the dependence these human dominated systems have on healthy and productive ecosystems. Measures of sustainability are required that include environmental support, use of nonrenewable resources, and labor & services. This work draws on primary and secondary data used in an emergy analysis approach to assess environmental support and sustainability of a wild catch sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska and Atlantic salmon aquaculture in Norway. The analyses ended at the processing gate for both production systems. Environmental support of the sockeye fishery amounted to 69% of total inputs for landed fish and 37% for processed fish, while the environmental support for farm raised Atlantic salmon was 60% and 42% for landed and processed fish respectively. Labor and services contributed 53% of total inputs for processed sockeye and 44% for Atlantic salmon. The emergy indices for the wild caught sockeye and farmed Atlantic salmon systems were relatively high having emergy yield ratios for landed fish of 3.2 (wild caught sockeye) and 2.3 (farmed Atlantic salmon). After processing emergy yields of both systems were 1.6 (sockeye) and 1.7 (Atlantic salmon). Environmental loading ratios for the sockeye fishery were 0.45 and 1.69 for landed salmon and processed fish respectively, while for Atlantic salmon they were 0.76 and 1.40 for harvested and processed fish respectively. Emergy sustainability indexes (ESI) for both production systems were much higher than other aquaculture systems. Landed sockeye salmon had an ESI of 7.2, while that of farmed raised Atlantic salmon was 3.0, somewhat lower, but still a relatively sustainable source of high-quality protein.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enjoyed stronger political support in Norway than in other countries. Early CCS initiatives were motivated by the challenge of reconciling relatively ambitious climate policy targets with growing emissions from Norway's offshore oil and gas operations, whose expertise and project opportunities formed the basis for these initiatives. The early start of the CCS debate created political path dependence effects, including recruitment of much of the environmental sector (government agencies and some NGOs) as CCS promoters. Paradoxically, the historical absence from Norway of fossil-based power generation also favoured CCS. Initiatives to add gas-fired generating capacity to Norway's previously emissions-free power supply created an entrenched conflict in which CCS became a politically necessary compromise. The more recent growth in political support for CCS in other countries may be explained by the fact that governments increasingly experience similar, politically difficult climate/energy policy dilemmas.

AB  - Fertility, or the availability of nutrients and water, controls forest productivity. It affects its carbon sequestration, and thus the forest's effect on climate, as well as its commercial value. Although the availability of nutrients cannot be measured directly using remote sensing methods, fertility alters several vegetation traits detectable from the reflectance spectra of the forest stand, including its pigment content and water stress. However, forest reflectance is also influenced by other factors, such as species composition and stand age. Here, we present a case study demonstrating how data obtained using imaging spectroscopy is correlated with site fertility. The study was carried out in Hyytiala, Finland, in the southern boreal forest zone. We used a database of state-owned forest stands including basic forestry variables and a site fertility index. To test the suitability of imaging spectroscopy with different spatial and spectral resolutions for site fertility mapping, we performed two airborne acquisitions using different sensor configurations. First, the sensor was flown at a high altitude with high spectral resolution resulting in a pixel size in the order of a tree crown. Next, the same area was flown to provide reflectance data with sub-meter spatial resolution. However, to maintain usable signal-to-noise ratios, several spectral channels inside the sensor were combined, thus reducing spectral resolution. We correlated a number of narrowband vegetation indices (describing canopy biochemical composition, structure, and photosynthetic activity) on site fertility. Overall, site fertility had a significant influence on the vegetation indices but the strength of the correlation depended on dominant species. We found that high spatial resolution data calculated from the spectra of sunlit parts of tree crowns had the strongest correlation with site fertility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article analyzes the influence of the preexisting institutional basis on designing and implementing new biodiversity and ecosystem services policies. The way that regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutions condition the currently popular payments for ecosystem services (PES) is analyzed by exploring the evolution of a championed forest biodiversity PES scheme in Finland. Our analysis of the evolution of the PES demonstrates several constraints on new policies. Based on policy documents and secondary material, we show how the policies that seemingly take effect through regulative institutional changes are conditioned by normative and cultural-cognitive institutions. Administrative and professional rigidities can be broken with a light policy experiment but for longer term governance development, radical institutional changes are necessary. The applied institutional framework demonstrates the analytical opportunities that attention to institutions generates for deepening the generally outcome-oriented evaluations of payments for ecosystem services policies.

AB  - This paper reviews the doctoral thesis of Viktor Toivo Aaltonen, published in 1919. The study was the first, and to this date the only detailed ecological description of the structure and regeneration of natural Pinus sylvestris-dominated dry heath forests in northern Finland. The average density of Pinus seedlings was 8766 ha-1. In general, Calluna sites had the most seedlings, followed by Cladina sites, postfire areas and Empetrum sites. Seedling abundance and quality declined with decreasing site fertility and increasing canopy cover. The main limiting factor for regeneration was regarded to be not canopy cover (shading), but its correlate, the intensity of below-ground competition. The mostly small understorey seedlings (10-30 cm) were considered to be unable to grow into the dominant tree layer unless a gap had formed in this layer. Several examples of the asymmetric competition between large trees and seedlings were provided. These included the distance-dependent adverse influence of isolated trees as well as gap and forest edge environments on seedling number and size. Special microhabitats, such as logs and their surroundings as well as uprooting spots, were found to be favourable regeneration sites. A special regeneration microsite effect was demonstrated by groups of seedlings around isolated large canopy trees, termed Tapio's gardens by local people. The study illustrates how the small-scale spatial heterogeneity observed in unmanaged dry pine forests influences tree population dynamics, leading to a wide range of variability in stand structures and successional stages. The value of Aaltonen's study perhaps especially lies in the description of a relatively intact ecosystem type, whose ecological quality has recently declined to the extent of becoming classified as a nationally threatened habitat type.

AB  - International trade has been favouring the dissemination of a wide suite of invasive alien species. Upstream prevention through the monitoring of entry points is identified as an appropriate strategy to achieve control of bioinvasions and their consequences. Maritime transportation has been responsible for the introduction worldwide of exotic rodents that are major pests for crops and food stocks as well as reservoirs of many zoonotic pathogens. In order to limit further dissemination, the International Health Regulation constrains decisions makers and socio-economic stakeholders to manage ship-mediated import/export of rodents within seaports.Unfortunately, eco-evolutionary insights into rodent introduction events that could guide preventive actions in seaports are very scarce. In order to bridge this gap, we here describe the results of a 3 year-long survey of small mammals conducted in the Port of Cotonou, Benin.Our aim was to assess the spatiotemporal distribution, diversity and relative abundance of invasive and native rodents.960 small mammal individuals were captured in nine within-seaport sites. We found (i) a marked predominance of invasive species (84% of the individuals belonging to Mus musculus, Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus), (ii) with native species (i.e. Mastomys natalensis and the shrew Crocidura olivieri) essentially restricted to peripheral non-industrial areas, as well as (iii) a fine-scale spatial segregation stable over time between the invasive Norway rats and house mice on the one hand, and the black rats and shrews on the other hand.Furthermore, trapping before and after two successive rodent control campaigns indicates that they were ineffective and that subsequent rodent recolonisation occurred 6-12 months following intervention.Synthesis and applications. Our results are discussed in terms of ecological processes at play (e.g. interspecific interactions) and operational recommendations (e.g. assessment of proper eradication units, environmental modifications).

AB  - Agricultural soils contribute to human welfare through their generation of manifold ecosystem services such as food security, water quality and climate regulation, but these are degraded by common farming practices. We have developed a roadmap for evaluating the contribution of both private- and public-good ecosystem services generated by agricultural soils to societal welfare. The approach considers the needs of decision-makers at different levels, from farmers to policy-makers. This we achieve through combining production functions-to quantify the impacts of alternative management practices on agricultural productivity and soil ecosystem services-with non-market valuation of changes in public-good ecosystem services and benefit-cost analysis. The results show that the net present value to society of implementing soil-friendly measures are substantial, but negative for farmers in our study region. Although we apply our roadmap to an intensive farming region in Sweden, we believe our results have broad applicability, because farmers do not usually account for the value of public-good ecosystem services. We therefore conclude that market outcomes are not likely to be generating optimal levels of soil ecosystem services from society's perspective. Innovative governance institutions are needed to resolve this market failure to safeguard the welfare of future generations.

Reliable population estimates are crucial for sustainable management, but it is currently unclear which monitoring method is most suitable to track changes in multi-species assemblages. We compared dung counts and camera trapping as two non-invasive census methods to estimate population densities of moose Alces alces and roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Northern Sweden. For camera trapping, we tested the random encounter model (REM) which can estimate densities without the need to recognize individual animals. We evaluated different simplification options of the REM in terms of estimates of detection distance and angle (raw data vs. modelled) and of daily movement rate (camera trap based vs. telemetry based). In comparison to density estimates from camera traps, we found that, dung counts appeared to underestimate population density for roe deer, but not for moose. Estimates of detection distance and angle from modelled versus raw camera data resulted in nearly identical outcomes. The telemetry-derived daily movement rate for moose and roe deer resulted in much higher density estimates than the camera trap-derived estimates. We suggest that camera trapping may be a robust complement to dung counts when monitoring ungulate communities, particularly when similarities between dung pellets from sympatric deer species make unambiguous assignment difficult. Moreover, we show that a simplified use of the REM method holds great potential for large-scale citizen science-based programmes (e.g. involving hunters) that can track the rapidly changing European wildlife landscape. We suggest to include camera trapping in management programmes, where the analysis can be verified via web-based applications.

AB  - Livestock has been a backbone of people's livelihood as long as agriculture has existed in Scandinavia, c. 6,000 years. In the early Iron Age, c. 2,000 years ago, a land management system began to form, composed of infields (enclosed hay-meadows and crop fields) and outlying land used for livestock grazing. Despite many later innovations and societal changes affecting agricultural technology and practices, this way of organizing land use was a template for how landscapes were managed and structured until the modernization of agriculture and forestry during the last centuries. There are legacies of this historic land-use, mainly as "semi-natural grasslands" managed by livestock grazing (open or semi-open; long continuity of management; not much influenced by commercial fertilizers, plowing etc.). These semi-natural grasslands harbor an exceptional small-scale biodiversity, particularly plants and insects. Landscapes with semi-natural grasslands represent cultural heritage, and are appreciated for their beauty. The total area of semi-natural grasslands has declined considerably during the past 100 years, and the current trend suggest that further declines are expected. A large fraction of threatened biodiversity in Sweden thrives in these grasslands. Livestock grazing in semi-natural grasslands makes an important contribution to food production, and there is an increasing interest in consumption of products, mainly meat, from these grasslands. This implies that there is a positive feedback between food production, maintenance of biological diversity, and cultural heritage. This paper gives an overview of semi-natural grasslands, focusing on Sweden, from a historic, cultural and ecological perspective, and aims at discussing challenges and prospects for developing and maintaining positive associations between producing food, biodiversity, and cultural heritage, in the future.

AB  - Radio-tracking was used to determine the foraging behaviour and habitat use of the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, at two roosts in southern England. The bars commuted an average of 6.5 km to and from distinct foraging sites and used up to five sites per night. Serotines foraged in a wide range of habitats and were able to locate and exploit temporary feeding sites such as recently mown grass. They foraged regularly around white streetlamps and in late summer over cattle pasture on which fresh dung was present. Reproductively active females were strongly philopatric to their day-roost. In contrast, reproductively inactive females, from the same roosts, moved to new day-roosts up to 10 km from the site of capture. Serotines used three distinct foraging strategies: short flights, ground feeding, and, predominantly, aerial hawking. Foraging bouts were interspersed with resting phases, with individuals roosting alone on walls of houses or in trees close to foraging sites. It is concluded that serotines are well adapted to an anthropogenic environment. They are strongly philopatric to roosts in human habitations, in close proximity to a range of feeding sites where they can take advantage of favourable land management practices.

AB  - The special issue presents international experiences with COVID-19 in the years 2020 and 2021 on outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism. To set the scene, a bibliometric and qualitative analysis illustrates and clusters recent publications on COVID-19. Against this background contributions from Japan, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Austria, Croatia, the United States, New Zealand, Taiwan, Australia, Sweden, Poland and Ireland draw a truly international picture of the pandemic crisis, the effects, coping behavior and related strategies. The papers contribute to the COVID-19 related research by documenting the shock in the field of outdoor recreation and tourism, by understanding the immediate consequences on behavior and the required managerial consequences and finally, by analyzing the possible follow up effects including long term effects, discussing resilient solutions and proposing new strategies. In the discussion section we try to answer the questions whether the high visitation rate in recreation facilities, forests, parks and protected areas will remain, and whether adapted visitor man-agement concepts will be required. In addition, we discuss possible implications for urban planning and man-agement. Finally, based on a changing connectedness to nature also possible positive effects by the pandemic are discussed which may lead to a new target group in outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism.Management implications: The overview on the Covid-19 related literature suggests improvements in planning and management, such as

AB  - Analyzing fungal diversity and community composition through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and high-throughput sequencing relies on sequence databases and their taxonomic coverage which are often doubted in regards of data accuracy. To assess the potential of eDNA metabarcoding to distinguish differently managed forest conversion stages, we compared an extant morphological dataset created through sporocarp surveys with a metabarcoding dataset from the same study sites. The study was conducted along a spruce forest conversion project of Norway spruce towards European beech in the Eifel National Park in Germany. Using the UNITE ITS reference database, a total of 198 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned up to the species level. Comparing the morphological and metabarcoding dataset, a low species overlap was observed with 27 shared fungi. The metabarcoding dataset revealed that all investigated forest conversion management stages shared beech-associated fungi (even the spruce forests), while within the morphological dataset, only the beechinhabiting forest conversion management stages showed beech-associated fungi. The metabarcoding dataset could not show the same fungal community response patterns on the spruce forest conversion, compared to the morphological dataset, but revealed the genetic refugium of the soil fungal community. We conclude that fungal eDNA metabarcoding should always be evaluated by taxonomic experts to identify potential sequence database errors. eDNA metabarcoding cannot be used interchangeably for morphological community analyses to identify response patterns of fungal communities on forest management strategies. However, both approaches performed well in combination and showed that beech-associated fungal communities with high functional redundancy can develop after a spruce forest conversion by restoring natural European beech forests with an appropriate close-tonature management strategy.

AB  - Long-term stabilization of injected carbon dioxide (CO2) is an essential component of risk management for geological carbon sequestration operations. However, migration and trapping phenomena are inherently complex, involving processes that act over multiple spatial and temporal scales. One example involves centimeter-scale density instabilities in the dissolved CO2 region leading to large-scale convective mixing that can be a significant driver for CO2 dissolution. Another example is the potentially important effect of capillary forces, in addition to buoyancy and viscous forces, on the evolution of mobile CO2. Local capillary effects lead to a capillary transition zone, or capillary fringe, where both fluids are present in the mobile state. This small-scale effect may have a significant impact on large-scale plume migration as well as long-term residual and dissolution trapping. Computational models that can capture both large and small-scale effects are essential to predict the role of these processes on the long-term storage security of CO2 sequestration operations. Conventional modeling tools are unable to resolve sufficiently all of these relevant processes when modeling CO2 migration in large-scale geological systems. Herein, we present a vertically-integrated approach to CO2 modeling that employs upscaled representations of these subgrid processes. We apply the model to the Johansen formation, a prospective site for sequestration of Norwegian CO2 emissions, and explore the sensitivity of CO2 migration and trapping to subscale physics. Model results show the relative importance of different physical processes in large-scale simulations. The ability of models such as this to capture the relevant physical processes at large spatial and temporal scales is important for prediction and analysis of CO2 storage sites.

AB  - The greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of European grasslands (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland), including CO2, CH4 and N2O, is estimated using the new process-based biogeochemical model ORCHIDEE-GM over the period 1961-2010. The model includes the following: (1) a mechanistic representation of the spatial distribution of management practice; (2) management intensity, going from intensively to extensively managed; (3) gridded simulation of the carbon balance at ecosystem and farm scale; and (4) gridded simulation of N2O and CH4 emissions by fertilized grassland soils and livestock. The external drivers of the model are changing animal numbers, nitrogen fertilization and deposition, land-use change, and variable CO2 and climate. The carbon balance of European grassland (NBP) is estimated to be a net sink of 15 +/- 7gCm(-2)year(-1) during 1961-2010, equivalent to a 50-year continental cumulative soil carbon sequestration of 1.0 +/- 0.4PgC. At the farm scale, which includes both ecosystem CO2 fluxes and CO2 emissions from the digestion of harvested forage, the net C balance is roughly halved, down to a small sink, or nearly neutral flux of 8gCm(-2)year(-1). Adding CH4 and N2O emissions to net ecosystem exchange to define the ecosystem-scale GHG balance, we found that grasslands remain a net GHG sink of 19 +/- 10g C-CO2 equiv. m(-2)year(-1), because the CO2 sink offsets N2O and grazing animal CH4 emissions. However, when considering the farm scale, the GHG balance (NGB) becomes a net GHG source of -50gC-CO2 equiv. m(-2)year(-1). ORCHIDEE-GM simulated an increase in European grassland NBP during the last five decades. This enhanced NBP reflects the combination of a positive trend of net primary production due to CO2, climate and nitrogen fertilization and the diminishing requirement for grass forage due to the Europe-wide reduction in livestock numbers.

AB  - The aims of this study were (1) to examine the geographic distribution of red-listed species of agricultural environments and identify their national threat spots (areas with high diversity of threatened species) in Finland and (2) to determine the main environmental variables related to the richness and occurrence patterns of red-listed species. Atlas data of 21 plant, 17 butterfly and 11 bird species recorded using 10 km grid squares were employed in the study. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed separately for species richness and occurrence of individual species of the three species groups using climate and land cover predictor variables. The predictive accuracy of models, as measured using correlation between the observed and predicted values and AUC statistics, was generally good. Temperature-related variables were the most important determinants of species richness and occurrence of all three taxa. In addition, land cover variables had a strong effect on the distribution of species. Plants and butterflies were positively related to the cover of grasslands and birds to small-scale agricultural mosaic as well as to arable land. Spatial coincidence of threat spots of plants, butterflies and birds was limited, which emphasizes the importance of considering the potentially contrasting environmental requirements of different taxa in conservation planning. Further, it is obvious that the maintenance of various non-crop habitats and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has an essential role in the preservation of red-listed species of boreal rural environments.

AB  - Tree visibility is a key determinant of cultural ecosystem services of urban trees. This paper develops a flexible, efficient and easy-to-use GIS method for modelling individual tree visibility to support tree valuation. The method is implemented as a GRASS GIS AddOn tool called v.viewshed.impact, making it available to a broad spectrum of users and purposes. Thanks to empirically validated underlying algorithms and parallel processing, the method is accurate and fast in analysing high-resolution datasets and large numbers of trees. We demonstrate the method in two use cases in Oslo, Norway, showing that it provides an alternative to field-based assessment of visibility indicators in tree valuation methods and facilitates the inclusion of complex visibility indicators not possible to assess in the field. We argue that the method could also be used for tree management and planning, urban ecosystem accounting and neighbour conflict resolution related to trees.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to measure the impact of benthic invertebrate diversity on processes occurring at the water-sediment interface. We analyzed the effects of interactions between three shallow water species (Cerastoderma edule, Corophium volutator, and Nereis diversicolor). The impacts of different species richness treatments were measured on sediment reworking, bacterial characteristics, and biogeochemical processes (bromide fluxes, O-2 uptake, nutrient fluxes, and porewater chemistry) in sediment cores. The results showed that the three species exhibited different bioturbation activities in the experimental system: C. edule acted as a biodiffusor, mixing particles in the top 2 cm of the sediments; C. volutator produced and irrigated U-shaped tubes in the top 2 cm of the sediments; and N. diversicolor produced and irrigated burrow galleries in the whole sediment cores. C. edule had minor effects on biogeochemical processes, whereas the other species, through their irrigation of the burrows, increased the Solute exchange between the water column and the sediment two-fold. These impacts on sediment structure and solute transport increased the O-2 consumption and the release of nutrients from sediments. As N. diversicolor burrowed deeper in the sediment than C. volutator, it irrigated a greater volume of sediments, with great impact on the sediment cores.
   Most treatments with a mixture of species indicated that observed values were often lower than predicted values from the addition of the individual effects of each species, demonstrating a negative interaction among species. This type of negative interaction measured between species on ecosystem processes certainly resulted from an overlap of bioturbation activities among the three species which, lived and foraged in the same habitat (water-sediment interface). All treatments with N. diversicolor (in isolation and in mixture) produced similar effect on sediment reworking, water fluxes, nutrient releases, porewater chemistry, and bacterial characteristics. Whichever species associated with N. diversicolor, the bioturbation activities of the worm hid the effect of the other species. The results suggest that, in the presence of several species that use and modify the same sediment space, impact of invertebrates on ecosystem processes was essentially due to the most efficient bioturbator of the community (N. diversicolor). In consequence, the functional traits (mode of bioturbation, depth of burrowing, feeding behaviour) of an individual species in a community could be more important than species richness for some ecosystem processes.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research and collaboration is widely acknowledged as a critical success factor for solution-oriented approaches that can tackle complex sustainability challenges, such as biodiversity loss, pollution, and climate-related hazards. In this context, city governments' engagement in transdisciplinarity is generally seen as a key condition for societal transformation towards sustainability. However, empirical evidence is rare. This paper presents a self-assessment of a joint research project on ecosystem services and climate adaptation planning (ECOSIMP) undertaken by four universities and seven Swedish municipalities. We apply a set of design principles and guiding questions for transdisciplinary sustainability projects and, on this basis, identify key aspects for supporting university-municipality collaboration. We show that: (1) selecting the number and type of project stakeholders requires more explicit consideration of the purpose of societal actors' participation; (2) concrete, interim benefits for participating practitioners and organisations need to be continuously discussed; (3) promoting the 'inter', i.e., interdisciplinary and inter-city learning, can support transdisciplinarity and, ultimately, urban sustainability and long-term change. In this context, we found that design principles for transdisciplinarity have the potential to (4) mitigate project shortcomings, even when transdisciplinarity is not an explicit aim, and (5) address differences and allow new voices to be heard. We propose additional guiding questions to address shortcomings and inspire reflexivity in transdisciplinary projects.

AB  - The paper presents documentation on the distribution of, and damages to, deep-water reefs of the coral Lophelia pertusa in Norwegian waters. The reef areas have traditionally been rich fishing grounds for long-line and gillnet fisheries, and the coral habitat is known to support a high diversity of benthic species. Anecdotal reports claim that trawlers often use the gear, wires, chains and trawl doors to crush the corals and clear the area before fishing starts. To get an overview of the situation, information about the distribution and damage were collected from the literature, fishermen, and our own investigations. The results show that the corals are abundant particularly on the mid Norwegian continental shelf between 200 and 400 m depth. In general it seems that the largest densities are distributed along the continental break and at ridges of morainic origin. The reports from fishermen suggested severe damage to the corals and in situ observations using ROV confirmed the presence of mechanically damaged corals located on trawling grounds. A first estimate of the fishery impact indicates that between 30 and 50% of the reef areas are damaged or impacted. Fishermen claim that catches are significantly lowered in areas where the reefs are damaged. Potential ecological consequences of the destruction are discussed.

AB  - In this exploratory study we use existing in situ qualitative and quantitative data on biophysical and social indicators to compare two contrasting Swedish farming systems (low intensity and high intensity) with regard to ecosystem service supply and demand of a broad suite of services. We show that the value (demand) placed on a service is not necessarily connected to the quantity (supply) of the service, most clearly shown for the services recreation, biodiversity, esthetic experience, identity, and cultural heritage. To better capture this complexity we argue for the need to develop portfolios of indicators for different ecosystem services and to further investigate the different aspects of supply and demand. The study indicates that available data are often ill-suited to answer questions about local delivery of services. If ecosystem services are to be included in policy, planning, and management, census data need to be formatted and scaled appropriately.

AB  - The Q-method identifies groups of people with similar or diverging perspectives and is increasingly used for analysing resource conflicts. However, it is uninformative on the prevalence of perspectives in the general population. The Norwegian government considers planting spruce climate forests on abandoned pastures, the habitat for many red listed species. We identify three prevailing stakeholder perspectives in the climate forest debate using the Q method; one pro climate forest and two against with differing motivations. Using the so-called scale creation method (Danielson, 2009) and a national survey, we measure the support of the general population for these perspectives and elicit their concern for ecosystem services. About half of the sample is pro climate forest. Opposition is greater in regions where spruce is uncommon and abandoned pastures are common. The impact of climate forests on biodiversity and landscapes is a concern. Conflicts would be dampened if climate forest policy took impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity better into account. Our proposed generalised Q method combines two strengths: the depth of the Q method with the breadth of the general population survey. The method demonstrates a way forward in ecological economics to better capture representative values and perspectives in ecosystem service management and help design climate and environmental policies with greater acceptance.

AB  - Of all non-arable habitats, field margins are the most important ones for bumblebees in agricultural environment, especially as they are wide-spread and offer food resources, but they are also places for reproduction and overwintering. This study was made to investigate bumblebee abundance in the agricultural environment and to obtain information on the use of southern Finnish field margins by bumblebees. Bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees were studied in a farmland area in Lammi, southern Finland, in 1996. Line-transect counts in field margins were made to compare habitat availability of patches of farmland and qualities of field margins within the patches. Landscape variables, dicotyledonous flower abundances and ecological and morphological characteristics of flowers were used as factors to explain variation in bumblebee assemblages and their frequencies of visits to the field margins. Bumblebee species richness and total density were higher in patches of farmland where field margins had more dicotyledonous flowers rather than being grassy. Abundance and flowering phenology of a limited number of flower species during the bumblebee breeding season were the most important factors explaining bumblebee visits in field margins. The most important flower species was zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). The width of field margins was significantly related to the total density of bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees, but not species number or diversity. (C). 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Knowledge about forest structures, particularly of deadwood, is fundamental for understanding, protecting, and conserving forest biodiversity. While individual tree-based approaches using single wavelength airborne laserscanning (ALS) can successfully distinguish broadleaf and coniferous trees, they still perform multiple tree species classifications with limited accuracy. Moreover, the mapping of standing dead trees is becoming increasingly important for damage calculation after pest infestation or biodiversity assessment. Recent advances in sensor technology have led to the development of new ALS systems that provide up to three different wavelengths. In this study, we present a novel method which classifies three tree species (Norway spruce, European beech, Silver fir), and dead spruce trees with crowns using full waveform ALS data acquired from three different sensors (wavelengths 532 nm, 1064 nm, 1550 nm). The ALS data were acquired in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) under leaf-on conditions with a maximum point density of 200 points/m(2). To avoid overfitting of the classifier and to find the most prominent features, we embed a forward feature selection method. We tested our classification procedure using 20 sample plots with 586 measured reference trees. Using single wavelength datasets, the highest accuracy achieved was 74% (wavelength = 1064 nm), followed by 69% (wavelength = 1550 nm) and 65% (wavelength = 532 nm). An improvement of 8-17% over single wavelength datasets was achieved when the multi wavelength data were used. Overall, the contribution of the waveform-based features to the classification accuracy was higher than that of the geometric features by approximately 10%. Our results show that the features derived from a multi wavelength ALS point cloud significantly improve the detailed mapping of tree species and standing dead trees.

AB  - Climate change has led to a focus on forest management techniques to increase carbon (C) sequestration as a mitigation measure. Fertilisation and increased removal of biomass have been proposed. But these and other forest practices may have undesirable effects on surface water quality. In naturally acid-sensitive areas such as much of Fennoscandia a concern is acidification due to acid deposition in combination with forest practices that increase the removal of base cations and leaching of nitrate (NO3). Here we apply the biogeochemical model MAGIC to the coniferous-forested catchment at Birkenes, southernmost Norway, to simulate the effects of forest fertilisation and harvest on soil and streamwater. The model was calibrated to the 40-year data for water quality, soil and vegetation and then used to simulate fertilisation and clearcutting of the mature forest by either conventional stem-only harvest (SOH) or whole-tree harvest (WTH). The 5 - 10-year pulse of NO3 following clearcut was larger with SOH than WTH. WTH causes larger acidification of surface water relative to SOH, due to greater depletion of base cations, N and C from the soil. The use of forestry as a climate mitigation measure should take into consideration the potential effects on soil and surface water quality.

AB  - The boreal forests of Fennoscandia are largely dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine. Conifer monocultures have been favoured in forest management during the last decades. Recently, concern has risen that forests consisting of only one tree species could be vulnerable to biotic damage. Additionally, environmental and societal changes are placing new demands on forest utilization, thus shifting the focus to alternative forest management options providing a wider scale of ecosystem services. It has been proposed that mixed forests are better than monocultures with respect to biodiversity, risk management and recreational value. By synthesising research studies, we provide an overview of current knowledge on how to combine wood production and other ecosystem services in mixed boreal forests in Fennoscandia. We addressed the following questions in more detail: what are the effects of mixed forests on soil properties, understorey vegetation, biodiversity, wildlife, resistance to and resilience against damage, forest productivity and the multiple use of forests? Furthermore, what are the silvicultural possibilities for establishing and managing mixed forests?
   Based on this review, mixed forests appear to provide a higher output of most ecosystem goods and services, including higher biodiversity and improved risk management, soil properties and multiple-use values. The most serious challenge is the browsing by cervids, which damages sapling stands. There is potential to establish single-storied mixed forests with current regeneration methods and material. Further research is particularly needed on the silvicultural practices suited for mixed boreal forests.

AB  - Stratigraphic records from peatlands suggest that the shift from a rich fen (calcareous fen) to an ombrotrophic bog can occur rapidly. This shift constitutes a switch from a species-rich ecosystem to a species-poor one with greater carbon storage. In this process, the invasion and expansion of acidifying bog species of Sphagnum (peat mosses) play a key role. To test under what conditions an acidifying bog species could invade a rich fen, we conducted three experiments, contrasting the bog species S. fucsum with the rich-fen species S. warnstorfii and S. teres. We first tested the effect of calcareous water by growing the three species at different constant height above the water table (HWT; 2, 7, and 14 cm) in a rich-fen pool and measured maximum photosynthetic rate and production and difference in length growth as an indicator of competition. In none of the species was the photosynthetic capacity negatively affected when placed at low HWT, but S. fuscum was a weaker competitor at low HWT. In our second experiment we transplanted the three species into microhabitats with different and naturally varying HWT in a rich fen. Here, S. fuscum nearly ceased to photosynthesize when transplanted to low HWT (brown moss carpet), while it performed similarly to the two rich-fen species at the intermediate level (S. warnstorfii hummock level). In contrast to S. fuscum, the rich-fen sphagna performed equally well in both habitats. The brown moss carpet was seasonally flooded, and in our third experiment we found that S. fuscum, but not S. teres, was severely damaged when submerged in rich-fen water. Our results suggest two thresholds in HWT affecting the ecosystem switch: one level that reduces the risk of submergence and a higher one that makes bog sphagna competitive against the rich-fen species.

AB  - Various features of a landscape contribute to the regulating ecosystem service of reducing waterborne pollutant loading to downstream environments. At local scales, wetlands have been shown to be effective in retaining pollutants. Here, we investigate the landscape-scale contribution to pollutant retention provided by multiple wetlands. We develop a general analytical model which shows that the retention contribution of wetlands and other landscape features is only significant if a large fraction of the total waterborne pollutant transport passes through them. Next, by means of a statistical analysis of official data, we quantify the nutrient retention contribution of wetlands for multiple sub-catchments in two Swedish Water Management Districts. We compare this with the retention contribution of two other landscape features: the waterborne transport distance and major lakes. The landscape-scale retention contribution of wetlands is undetectable; rather, the other two landscape features account for much of the total nutrient retention.

AB  - Boreal coniferous forests act as an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The overall tree carbon (C) sink in the forests of Europe has increased during the past decades, especially due to management and elevated nitrogen (N) deposition; however, industrial atmospheric pollution, primarily sulphur dioxide and heavy metals, still negatively affect forest biomass production at different spatial scales. We report local and regional changes in forest aboveground biomass, C and N concentrations in plant tissues, and C and N pools caused by long-term atmospheric emissions from a large point source, the nickel-copper smelter in Monchegorsk, in north-western Russia. An increase in pollution load (assessed as Cu concentration in forest litter) caused C to increase in foliage but C remained unchanged in wood, while N decreased in foliage and increased in wood, demonstrating strong effects of pollution on resource translocation between green and woody tissues. The aboveground C and N pools were primarily governed by plant biomass, which strongly decreased with an increase in pollution load. In our study sites (located 1.6-39.7 km from the smelter) living aboveground plant biomass was 76 to 4888 g m(-2), and C and N pools ranged 35-2333 g C m(-2) and 0.5-35.1 g N m(-2), respectively. We estimate that the aboveground plant biomass is reduced due to chronic exposure to industrial air pollution over an area of about 107,200 km(2), and the total (aboveground and belowground) loss of phytomass C stock amounts to 4.24 x 10(13) g C. Our results emphasize the need to account for the overall impact of industrial polluters on ecosystem C and N pools when assessing the C and N dynamics in northern boreal forests because of the marked long-term negative effects of their emissions on structure and productivity of plant communities.

AB  - Seaweed cultivation attracts growing interest and sustainability assessments from various perspectives are needed. The paper presents a holistic qualitative assessment of ecosystem services affected by seaweed cultivation on the Swedish west coast. Results suggest that supporting, regulating and provisioning services are mainly positively or non-affected while some of the cultural services are likely negatively affected. The analysis opens for a discussion on the framing of seaweed cultivation - is it a way of supplying ecosystem services and/or a way of generating valuable biomass? Exploring these framings further in local contexts may be valuable for identifying trade-offs and designing appropriate policies and development strategies. Many of the found impacts are likely generalizable in their character across sites and scales of cultivation, but for some services, including most of the supporting services, the character of impacts is likely to be site-specific and not generalizable.

AB  - P>1. Environmental changes may not always result in rapid changes in species distributions, abundances or diversity. In order to estimate the effects of, for example, land-use changes caused by agri-environment schemes (AES) on biodiversity and ecosystem services, information on the time-lag between the application of the scheme and the responses of organisms is essential.
   2. We examined the effects of time since transition (TST) to organic farming on plant species richness and butterfly species richness and abundance. Surveys were conducted in cereal fields and adjacent field margins on 60 farms, 20 conventional and 40 organic, in two regions in Sweden. The organic farms were transferred from conventional management between 1 and 25 years before the survey took place. The farms were selected along a gradient of landscape complexity, indicated by the proportion of arable land, so that farms with similar TST were represented in all landscape types. Organism responses were assessed using model averaging.
   3. Plant and butterfly species richness was c. 20% higher on organic farms and butterfly abundance was about 60% higher, compared with conventional farms. Time since transition affected butterfly abundance gradually over the 25-year period, resulting in a 100% increase. In contrast, no TST effect on plant or butterfly species richness was found, indicating that the main effect took place immediately after the transition to organic farming.
   4. Increasing landscape complexity had a positive effect on butterfly species richness, but not on butterfly abundance or plant species richness. There was no indication that the speed of response to organic farming was affected by landscape complexity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The effect of organic farming on diversity was rapid for plant and butterfly species richness, whereas butterfly abundance increased gradually with time since transition. If time-lags in responses to AESs turn out to be common, long-term effects would need to be included in management recommendations and policy to capture the full potential of such schemes.

AB  - Plantation forests with timber production as the major function are highly fragmented and disturbed regarding the tree species composition and stand area. Their closed canopies also have different microclimatic conditions compared with better studied conservation areas. We studied three beetle families (click, longhorn, and rove beetles) with different ecological demands in lowland plantation forests dominated by Sessile oak and Norway spruce in the Czech Republic. Our main interest was how their species richness, abundance, diversity, body length, rarity, red-list status, species composition and individual species were driven by the main tree species, stand area and canopy openness. We analyzed 3466 individuals from 198 beetle species and the results revealed complex and contrasting responses of the studied beetle families - click beetles mostly preferred sun-exposure and spruce as the dominant tree species, longhorn beetles mainly preferred large stands, whereas rove beetles were mostly influenced by oak as the dominant tree species and increasing area. We also observed that some species had different preferences in plantation forests than is known from the literature. The main conclusions of our results are that the dominance of non-natural spruce plantations and a large stand area (both originating from artificially replanted large clear-cuts) did not affect the majority of the studied taxa as we expected. On the other hand, our results might have been influenced by other factor, such as the current small total area of the former vegetation, which in the past might have led to extinction debt; or a large area of other conifers in the surroundings that might have promoted conifer-associated fauna.

AB  - The goals of conservation agriculture are to preserve and enhance the soil resource base and the environment. Subsidiary crops (SCs), such as Trifolium, Medicago, Vicia, Brassica, Raphanus spp., are important components of conservation agriculture since they maintain the soil resource. However, the importance of SC species and environment on soil microbial communities are not well known. The overall objective of this study was to assess the effect of various subsidiary crops cultivation on soil microbial biomass and activity at four sites across Europe. The experiments were conducted during 2014 and 2015 at sites in the Nemoral (Sweden SLU), Oceanic (United Kingdom ORC), Continental (Switzerland AGS) and Mediterranean north (Italy UNI) pedo-climatic zones. The specific objectives were to determine: (i) the effect of SC growth on soil microbial biomass and activity, (ii) the site-specific effect of SC growth on soil biochemical properties. The SCs consisted of leguminous or brassicaceous species sown after wheat harvest, or clover species under-sown in wheat. At 0-30 cm depth, microbial carbon and nitrogen increased under SCs at most sites indicating that SCs cultivation may favor soil biological fertility. Effects of SCs were similar in the pedo-climatic zones where air temperatures are never below 0 degrees C (ORC and UNI). Arylsulphatase was the most sensitive enzyme to legumes in the Mediterranean north (UNI). Chitinase activity was enhanced by SCs in the Oceanic and Nemoral pedo-climatic zones. High precipitation and the low average temperature, typical of Continental and Nemoral zones, may represent limiting factors for soil enzyme activity under all selected SCs. Among the four pedo-climatic zones, the Mediterranean north represented the most suitable environment to promote SC growth and soil coverage. This study showed that SC cultivation affects soil quality enhancing biochemical activity; however the SCs effect were influenced by the different pedo-climatic conditions.

AB  - The management of dead wood is crucial to the conservation of saproxylic beetles, species dependent on dead wood. This holds for both natural forest and tree plantations. However, the importance of dead wood in tropical forest ecosystems is not yet well understood. The present study investigates saproxylic beetle assemblages of native and exotic standing dead trees (snags). The study was conducted in semi-deciduous protected forest and tree plantations of the Lama Forest Reserve in Benin, West Africa. The snag beetle fauna was sampled for a total of 12 weeks during one year, using trunk window traps. As a control an equal number of live trees was sampled to distinguish saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles. Mean snag beetle species richness, relative abundance and the number of singletons, species sampled only once, per snag were similar among native and exotic snags. The total number of snag beetle species and beta-diversity of snag beetle assemblages were higher for native than for exotic snags, reflecting high heterogeneity in habitat quality among snags in natural forest. It is concluded that snag beetle assemblages were influenced mainly by the forest system, semi-deciduous forest vs plantations. With regard to dead wood management, retention or creation of snags in semi-deciduous forest, as well as in plantations, can enhance and preserve the diversity of the saproxylic beetle fauna.

AB  - Forests deliver many ecosystem services, from provisioning to regulating and cultural services. We aimed at demonstrating microclimatic regulation and pollutant removal as especially relevant ecosystem services when considering the tourism vocation of the Alpine regions. A study was realized along an altitudinal gradient (900-1600 m a.s.l.) in Trentino, northern Italy, an area with high touristic presence (ca. 9.3 million overnight stays in summer 2021). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2, mu g m(-3)), ozone (O-3, mu g m(-3)) concentrations, air temperature (T, degrees C), and relative humidity (RH, %) were simultaneously measured in three open-field sites (OF) and below-canopy Norway spruce forest stands (FO) during the period 23 May-7 August 2013. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated. We found a distinct mitigating effect of forest on T, with lower maximum (-30.6%) and higher minimum values (+6.3%) in FO than in OF. THI supported a higher comfort sensation in FO than in OF, especially in the central part of the day. NO2 concentrations did not differ between OF and FO; ozone concentrations were lower in FO than OF. This study confirms the role of forests in providing several ecosystem services beneficial for forest users, especially relevant for promoting nature-based tourism in the Alpine region.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) represent the most recent of several "greening" concepts proposed to support spatial planning and decision-making towards sustainable metropolitan regions. Despite similarities, the concepts stem from different disciplines and policy arenas and reflect various models of people-nature relations. This paper aims to analyze the uptake of greening concepts in scientific planning literature focusing on (urban) nature and landscape in the metropolitan region of Stockholm, Sweden, over the last three decades. It investigates what changes this evolution has brought in terms of the topics adopted, methods applied, and types of planning support put into practice. We identified 574 articles that reflect substantial research on greening concepts in the Swedish planning context. The articles demonstrate an initial prevalence of biodiversity with later increases of interest in ecosystem services and NBS. A detailed analysis of the studies focusing on Stockholm revealed Population growth/densification, Green space management and Biodiversity conservation as the most commonly addressed societal challenges. The most frequently mentioned type of green and blue element is Parks and (semi)natural urban green areas, including urban forests. Methods applied were mostly quantitative, while mixes with qualitative approaches were only apparent in ecosystem services articles. Half of the studies involved practitioners or decision-makers, but only four seemed related to real-life planning processes. Taken together, the influence of scientific literature on the uptake of greening concepts in spatial planning seems to have been limited. Future mainstreaming of greening concepts in Stockholm and beyond could benefit from available data, methods and experiences, but will require more active translation and boundary management. Further research into science-policy-planning interfaces at city scale is thus imperative to advance more sustainable pathways for people and nature in metropolitan regions.

AB  - The effect of the biomass conversion system called integrated production of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) on above ground biomass yield and diversity in semi-natural grasslands of lower mountain ranges was investigated over a time span of 5 years. The system uses late cut grassland biomasses and produces energy carriers and a liquid fertilizer, the effect of which was tested against the alternative of harvest without fertilization and mulching without fertilization. The biomass yield significantly improved both in fertilized and mulched treatments, whereas it remained low in the unfertilized treatment. The effects on diversity were less explicit. Species numbers remained stable in the fertilized and unfertilized cutting treatment and decreased in the mulching treatment. The applied treatment showed no significant effect on diversity indices (H', E and T). Mean Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients revealed that species accustomed to nutrient poor habitats increased in the unfertilized cut treatment and decreased in the fertilized and mulched treatment.

AB  - Creating an exhibition is a multidisciplinary task which, besides the work of the authors of the scenario, copywriters and experts in the given topic, involves also the work of architects and landscape architects. Although the paper reflects on various completed exhibitions, the scenario and form of an exhibition cannot be separated. The paper focuses on spatial aspects of outdoor exhibitions from the perspective of an architect and landscape architect and documents them via various completed exhibitions. In terms of architecture they can be classified upon the aspects of form and content, wherein form covers the spatial, i.e. architectural, design of the exhibition and means, and content covers the quantity, complexity, style and chronology of the information communicated. The motivation for the paper is the need to identify the factors influencing the educational quality of exhibitions that the professionals designing the space and form of exhibitions may use in their practice. This covers predominantly those factors that relate to the designing of spaces where exhibitions take place based on the given scenarios, to which the viewers react rather subconsciously.The method used for the research is a spatial and content analysis of three exhibitions presenting cultural and natural heritage, specifically Hardangervidda National Park in Norway, Kongernes Jelling visitor centre in Denmark, and the National Museum of Rural Life at Wester Kittochside - Scottish National Museum in Great Britain. Factors considered include: the connection to the site - landscape context; authenticity; spatial scenario; and so-called warm-up and cool-down spaces that create atmosphere. A scenario, as in a film, connects the environment and content in a defined chronology. By this research we want to follow up on the trend in museums and exhibitions to present information through powerful narrative storytelling.

AB  - Logging has ecological effects on invertebrates in Fennoscandian boreal forest. Especially infected are species associated with micro-habitats of natural old-growth forest, such as coarse woody debris, large deciduous trees, and patches of wet swamp-forest. Furthermore, the effective control of forest fires has adversely, affected many species that require burned substrates. Although old-growth specialists tend to disappear from clear-cuts, local invertebrate species richness (alpha-diversity) may increase as forest generalists persist and numerous open-habitat species appear: This seems true at least for taxa (e.g., ground-beetles and spiders) that are not directly associated with the characteristic micro-habitats of old growth mentioned above. However, at the landscape or biogeographical scale intensive logging tends to homogenize forest habitats and lend to declines of sensitive species. Based on these findings three complementary approaches appear useful for the maintenance of boreal biodiversity while harvesting timber. (1) Undisturbed old-growth forests must be set aside to sustain specialist species and to serve ns sources for recolonization. (2) Because these reserves are not, and will probably not be, large and regionally representative enough, ecologically sound silvicultural practices must be developed using natural disturbance regimes as guidelines. (3) Restoration of habitats and the process of natural regeneration through fire is imperative for the recovery of associated species assemblages However, the process of recovery presupposes that colonists are available, which may not always be the case.

AB  - The absence of functional top predators has been proposed as a mechanism acting to shape fish assemblages in temperate marine ecosystems, with cascading effects on lower trophic levels. We explore this scenario by comparing the trophic and functional status of fish assemblages in Norwegian marine national parks, open to fishing, to a nearby coastal seascape that harbors a system of marine protected areas (MPAs) including a no-take zone. Demersal fish assemblages were sampled using fyke nets over three consecutive seasons. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is potentially a dominant top predator in this ecosystem, and historically, this and other gadids have been targeted by the full range of former and present fisheries. In the present study, we find that average body size of the Atlantic cod was significantly larger in the zoned seascape compared to the unprotected areas (mean +/- SD: 36.6 cm +/- 14.38 vs. 23.4 +/- 7.50; p < .001) and that the unprotected seascape was characterized by a higher abundance of mesopredator fish species. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the protection of top predators within MPAs aids to control the mesopredator populations and provides empirical support to the notion that the present state of many coastal fish assemblages is driven by mesopredator release linked to functional depletion of large top predators.

AB  - Demand for lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) has increased exponentially over the last decade, both for their roe, which is used as a caviar substitute, and increasingly also as cleaner fish to control sea lice in salmon farming. The species is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN and there are growing concerns that over-exploitation of wild stocks and translocation of hatchery-reared lumpfish may compromise the genetic diversity of native populations. We carried out a comparative analysis of genetic and phenotypic variation across the species' range to estimate the level of genetic and phenotypic differentiation, and determined patterns of gene flow at spatial scales relevant to management. We found five genetically distinct groups located in the West Atlantic (USA and Canada), Mid Atlantic (Iceland), East Atlantic (Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, Norway and Denmark), English Channel (England) and Baltic Sea (Sweden). Significant phenotypic differences were also found, with Baltic lumpfish growing more slowly, attaining a higher condition factor and maturing at a smaller size than North Atlantic lumpfish. Estimates of effective population size were consistently low across the North East Atlantic (Iceland, Faroe Islands and Norway), the area where most wild lumpfish are fished for their roe, and also for the aquaculture industry. Our study suggests that some lumpfish populations are very small and have low genetic diversity, which makes them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation and genetic introgression. To protect them we advocate curtailing fishing effort, closing the breeding cycle of the species in captivity to reduce dependence on wild stocks, restricting the translocation of genetically distinct populations, and limiting the risk of farm escapes.

AB  - There has been substantial urban growth in Stockholm, Sweden, the fastest-growing capital in Europe. The intensifying urbanization poses challenges for environmental management and sustainable development. Using Sentinel-2 and SPOT-5 imagery, this research investigates the evolution of land-cover change in Stockholm County between 2005 and 2015, and evaluates urban growth impact on protected green areas, green infrastructure and urban ecosystem service provision. One scene of 2015 Sentinel-2A multispectral instrument (MSI) and 10 scenes of 2005 SPOT-5 high-resolution instruments (HRI) imagery over Stockholm County are classified into 10 land-cover categories using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, textural and geometric features. Reaching accuracies of approximately 90%, the classifications are then analyzed to determine impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2005 and 2015, including land-cover change statistics, landscape-level urban ecosystem service provision bundle changes and evaluation of regional and local impact on legislatively protected areas as well as ecologically significant green infrastructure networks. The results indicate that urban areas increased by 15%, while non-urban land cover decreased by 4%. In terms of ecosystem services, changes in proximity of forest and low-density built-up areas were the main cause of lowered provision of temperature regulation, air purification and noise reduction. There was a decadal ecosystem service loss of 4.6 million USD (2015 exchange rate). Urban areas within a 200 m buffer zone around the Swedish environmental protection agency's nature reserves increased 16%, with examples of urban areas constructed along nature reserve boundaries. Urban expansion overlapped the deciduous ecological corridor network and green wedge/core areas to a small but increasing degree, often in close proximity to weak but important green links in the landscape. Given these findings, increased conservation/restoration focus on the region's green weak links is recommended.

AB  - Data have been compiled on the distribution, habitat preferences and population sizes of 348 vertebrates reproducing in Sweden (excluding fish) and their species richness in different habitats and regions was investigated. Furthermore, we compared the habitat preferences and distribution of rare and common vertebrates. The relative species number (corrected for area) increases from the north (the hemiarctic/boreal zone) to the south (the temperate/hemiboreal zone). The relative number of species in major habitats is highest in farmland, lakes and running waters, and possibly also in the sea. However, the absolute number of species is highest in woodland, the dominant habitat in Sweden (56% of the land area excluding sea). Within woodlands, a large proportion of species occur in southern deciduous forests, in other deciduous forests and in mixed forests, while coniferous forests are less species-rich when the habitat area is taken into account. In farmland, the most species-rich habitats are meadows and forest edges, while marshes are the most species-rich habitats amongst lakes and running waters. Nationally rare species (<1000 individuals) have a smaller European range than common species, and they also have their European distribution centres further to the south than the common species. Of the species occurring in large parts of Sweden (that is, both in the north and the south) a low proportion (4.7%) are classified as rare compared with species occurring mainly in the north (20.6% rare) or mainly in the south (31.6% rare) of Sweden. There is a positive correlation between the number of rare species and the total species number in 41 subcategory habitats, and the proportion of rare species is similar in most habitats. A more detailed analysis (including effects of both regions and habitats) suggests that the proportion of rare species in a region is a result of differences between latitudes, but also of different habitats (when corrected for latitude effects). There are differences in the proportion of rare species between the nine most species-rich orders (for example, there is a high proportion of rare species in the order Carnivora and a low proportion in the order Rodentia), but the proportion of rare species in these orders is not independent of the habitats in which they occur, making it difficult to separate the effects of habitat preferences and taxonomy on rarity. The focusing of conservation work on relatively species-rich habitats in southern and middle Sweden - such as some farmland habitats (that is, meadows and forest edges), marshes (in connection with lakes and running waters) and forests with a relatively high proportion of deciduous trees - is of high priority if the conservation of biodiversity is a main goal. These are also the habitats with a high number of rare and red-listed species.

AB  - Questions: What are the water economy strategies of the dominant subarctic bryophytes in terms of colony and shoot traits? Can colony water retention capacity be predicted from morphological traits of both colonies and separate shoots? Are suites of water retention traits consistently related to bryophyte habitat and phylogenetic position?
   Location: Abisko Research Station, North Sweden.
   Methods: We screened 22 abundant subarctic bryophyte species from diverse habitats for water economy traits of shoots and colonies, including desiccation rates, water content at field capacity, volume and density (mg cm(-3)) of water-saturated and oven-dried patches, evaporation rate (g . m (2) . s (1)) and cell wall thickness. The relationships between these traits and shoot and colony desiccation rates were analysed with Spearman rank correlations. Subsequent multivariate (cluster followed by PCA) analyses were based on turf density, turf and shoot desiccation rate, cell wall thickness and amount of external and internal water.
   Results: Individual shoot properties, i.e. leaf cellwall properties, water retention capacity and desiccation rate, did not correspond with colony water retention capacity. Colony desiccation rate depended on density of water-saturated colonies, and was marginally significantly negatively correlated with species individual shoot desiccation rate but not related to any other shoot or colony trait. Multivariate analyses based on traits assumed to determine colony desiccation rate revealed six distinct species groups reflecting habitat choice and phylogenetic relationships.
   Conclusions: General relationships between shoot and colony traits as determinants of water economy will help to predict and upscale changes in hydrological function of bryophyte-dominated peatlands undergoing climate-induced shifts in species abundance, and feedbacks of such species shifts on permafrost insulation and carbon sequestration functions.

AB  - Simple Summary The bed bugs, Cimex lectularius and C. hemipterus, have undergone a significant resurgence worldwide since the 1990s. Despite reports of bed bug infestations being on the rise in recent years in France, little is known about the geographical dispersion, species composition, and inter-and intraspecific genetic variation among bed bug populations in the Paris area. The collection of 1211 samples of bed bugs from different infested locations in Paris (15 arrondissements) and its suburb cities (18 cities) allowed us to highlight C. lectularius as the predominant species and to document for the first time the presence of C. hemipterus in four infested locations (15th and 19th arrondissements, Bobigny, and Villejuif) in the Paris area. Successful bidirectional sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) gene for 132 specimens representing processed locations revealed two subpopulations of C. lectularius in Paris by neighbor-joining and network phylogenetic analyses. These results provide essential information for further epidemiological and public health studies and may help control management strategies in this metropolis. Cimex lectularius and C. hemipterus are blood-sucking insects with a long history of presence in human communities. We investigated the molecular diversity of the bed bug population of Paris and its suburb cities using cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) sequencing. A total of 1211 specimens belonging to different life stages were collected from 62 infested human dwellings in Paris (13 out of 20 arrondissements) and the surrounding cities (18 cities). Morphological determination and COI sequencing of 132 specimens demonstrated C. lectularius as the predominant species and, surprisingly, the presence of C. hemipterus in four infested areas of Paris and its suburb cities. Neighbor-joining tree and network analyses depicted the presence of two C. lectularius populations. Most samples from Paris and its suburb cities clustered in a major clade. The second population encompasses specimens from Paris (arrondissements 11 and 19) and its suburb cities (e.g., Bobigny, Pantin, and Montreuil) that clustered with Hungary, Czechia, and Finland. This is the second evidence for C. hemipterus infestation in France and the third in Europe, which challenges the classic pattern of C. hemipterus dispersion and implies sympatric occurrence of C. lectularius and C. hemipterus. Since Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, our observations shed light on bed bugs' dispersal dynamic and may help future vector control strategies.

AB  - The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts positive effects of structural complexity on species coexistence. Increasing habitat heterogeneity can change the diversity (number of species, abundances) and the functional roles of communities. The latter, however, is not well understood as species and individuals may respond very differently and dynamically to a changing environment. Here, we experimentally test how habitat heterogeneity affects generalist arthropod predators, including epigaeic spiders, carabid and staphylinid beetles, under natural conditions by assessing their diversity and directly measuring their trophic interactions (which provide a proxy for their functional roles). The experiment was conducted in spring barley fields in Southern Sweden where habitat heterogeneity was manipulated by increasing within-field plant diversity. Increased habitat heterogeneity triggered rapid changes in the feeding behaviour of generalist predators characterized by lower trophic specialization at both network (H-2', degree of interaction specialization in the entire network) and species level (d', degree of interaction specialization at the species level). We presume that this is because spatial separation resulted in relaxed competition and allowed an increased overlap in resources used among predator species. Predators collected from heterogenous habitats also showed greater individual-level dietary variability which might be ascribed to relaxed intraspecific competition. Our results provide conclusive evidence that habitat heterogeneity can induce rapid behavioural responses independent of changes in diversity, potentially promoting the stability of ecosystem functions.

AB  - To support decision-making, benefit assessments have become an obligatory part of natural resource management. In this context, the ecosystem services (ES) framework has been widely adopted for identifying and assessing the values at stake, yet the concept ignores benefits from water and land use functions as important contributions for societal welfare. This paper aims to contribute knowledge for improved benefit assessments in human-modified landscapes, exemplified by watersheds regulated for the production of hydropower. Through a case study approach in two regulated watersheds in Norway, beneficiaries' perceptions of the benefits associated with key watershed activities, i.e., hydropower production, kayaking, angling, and hiking, are presented. Considering the beneficiaries' perspectives, we discuss the relative ability of economic, quantitative, and qualitative assessment methods to present benefits. The study shows that benefit assessments must be carried out on different scales of governance, as benefits are context and scale dependent. We argue for an approach which considers a balance of benefits obtained from ecosystem services, and from water and land use functions within ecological limits. The suitability of the ES framework for guiding benefit assessments in a human-modified landscape and its complementarity with the sustainability concept for informing local-level decision-making are discussed.

AB  - Valuation studies have been mobilized to demonstrate the importance of nature to society and to incorporate concerns about nature into decision making. Although increasingly popular in ecosystem service research, such studies have also been criticized. In particular, tensions between the assumptions of valuation methods and the real-life processes of valuing have been identified. This article argues that a process-based, pragmatist approach to valuing helps to evaluate the relevance of valuation studies results. Pragmatism proposes a focus on activities through which people come to value natural elements in their everyday life rather than on the outcomes of valuing processes. Using this approach we examine three empirical cases: 1) restoration of natural Springs in Finland; 2) protection of the bearded vulture in the French Alps; and 3) management of urban biodiversity in the City of Grenoble, France. Through these cases we demonstrate how nature's value to people emerges from commonplace ways of engaging with natural elements, such as domestication, inheriting and community building. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of acknowledging this kind of processes in nature conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly being used to inform urban green infrastructure planning. We explore the use of modern cloud computing technologies (Google Earth Engine) to facilitate public access to spatial MCDA of ecosystem services from green infrastructure. Using the spatial prioritization of green roof retrofitting in Oslo, Norway, as a case study, we present a web application that is a generalizable tool for engaging stakeholders in spatial planning of ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions. In our application, green roof designers, owners and operators identified the relative importance of a suite of potential ecosystem services (ES) gained from retrofitting of green roofs, conditional on preference profiles expected by users of different building functional types. The ES assessed included temperature regulation, stormwater runoff mitigation, habitat for biodiversity, aesthetic value, and noise reduction. In Oslo we found high spatial correlation in ES deficits, implying that even large differences in stakeholder preferences for individual ES will lead MCDA to identify common interests in the spatial targeting of green roofs. Nevertheless, we found the interactive spatial MCDA web application to have potential for improving planning process efficiency in engaging stakeholders. In more heterogenous urban landscapes, with lower spatial correlation of individual ES, spatial MCDA also has scope to improve the output efficiency of spatial targeting of nature-based solutions such as green roofs.

AB  - It is generally accepted that urban vegetation improves air quality and thereby enhances the well-being of citizens. However, empirical evidence on the potential of urban trees to mitigate air pollution is meager, particularly in northern climates with a short growing season. We studied the ability of urban park/forest vegetation to remove air pollutants (NO2, anthropogenic VOCs and particle deposition) using passive samplers in two Finnish cities. Concentrations of each pollutant in August (summer; leaf-period) and March (winter, leaf-free period) were slightly but often insignificantly lower under tree canopies than in adjacent open areas, suggesting that the role of foliage in removing air pollutants is insignificant. Furthermore, vegetation-related environmental variables (canopy closure, number and size of trees, density of understorey vegetation) did not explain the variation in pollution concentrations. Our results suggest that the ability of urban vegetation to remove air pollutants is minor in northern climates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation is an important component in global ecosystems, affecting the physical, hydrological and biogeochemical properties of the land surface. Accordingly, the way vegetation is parameterized strongly influences predictions of future climate by Earth system models. To capture future spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover and its feedbacks to the climate system, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are included as important components of land surface models. Variation in the predicted vegetation cover from DGVMs therefore has large impacts on modelled radiative and non-radiative properties, especially over high-latitude regions. DGVMs are mostly evaluated by remotely sensed products and less often by other vegetation products or by in situ field observations. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three methods for spatial representation of present-day vegetation cover with respect to prediction of plant functional type (PFT) profiles - one based upon distribution models (DMs), one that uses a remote sensing (RS) dataset and a DGVM (CLM4.5BGCDV; Community Land Model 4.5 Bio-Geo-Chemical cycles and Dynamical Vegetation). While DGVMs predict PFT profiles based on physiological and ecological processes, a DM relies on statistical correlations between a set of predictors and the modelled target, and the RS dataset is based on classification of spectral reflectance patterns of satellite images. PFT profiles obtained from an independently collected field-based vegetation dataset from Norway were used for the evaluation. We found that RS-based PFT profiles matched the reference dataset best, closely followed by DM, whereas predictions from DGVMs often deviated strongly from the reference. DGVM predictions overestimated the area covered by boreal needleleaf evergreen trees and bare ground at the expense of boreal broadleaf deciduous trees and shrubs. Based on environmental predictors identified by DM as important, three new environmental variables (e.g. minimum temperature in May, snow water equivalent in October and precipitation seasonality) were selected as the threshold for the establishment of these high-latitude PFTs. We performed a series of sensitivity experiments to investigate if these thresholds improve the performance of the DGVM method. Based on our results, we suggest implementation of one of these novel PFT-specific thresholds (i.e. precipitation seasonality) in the DGVM method. The results highlight the potential of using PFT-specific thresholds obtained by DM in development of DGVMs in broader regions. Also, we emphasize the potential of establishing DMs as a reliable method for providing PFT distributions for evaluation of DGVMs alongside RS.

AB  - To promote the growth of nature based tourism in privately owned forest areas, new policy instruments, e.g. Payments for Ecosystem Services, are needed. They could engage private forest owners and nature-based tourism companies to cooperate and support the growth of the sector. We studied the entrepreneurs' attitudes towards the importance of environmental amenities and assessments of possible improvements in forest landscapes for their business in the framework of proposed Payments for Ecosystem Services mechanism, called Landscape and Recreation Value Trade. In the analyses, we compared the assessments of two groups of companies: core naturebased tourism companies that produce most services for tourists, and general service companies that produce services for both tourists and local people. We collected a data set from an online survey that was sent to representatives of the companies of the Ruka-Kuusamo region, Finland. Core nature-based tourism companies see forest landscape beauty as being more important for their business than do general service companies. In addition, we hypothesized in the questionnaire that the quality of landscape would improve so that the impacts of forest management practices, such as the traces of clear cuttings and intensive site preparation would be less visible in future than today. If the quality improves in the core area of tourism, the activity of the business of the 2 company groups will increase equally. If, however, the quality improves in a wider area, both the number of clients and revenues will increase more for nature-based tourism companies than for general service companies. Finally, related to the implementation of suggested Payments for Ecosystem Services, nature-based tourism companies had both more interest in collecting payments from tourists for a fund for landscape quality improvement and to make a private agreement with forest owners for improving landscape quality. For the policy makers of regions where nature tourism has potential, the following suggestions are given: As attractive landscape is identified as being an important factor for the nature-based tourism business, new types of mechanisms are needed to secure a good quality of this basic resource and the positive development of this sector. As the level of interest in participating in funding and agreements related to Payments for Ecosystem Services can be rather low among entrepreneurs, an incentive mechanism for companies should also be launched. In addition, a collaborative deliberation and communication process is needed for implementing the mechanism.

AB  - An international cooperative project on distribution of ozone in the Carpathian Mountains, Central Europe was conducted from 1997 to 1999. Results of that project indicated that in large parts of the Carpathian Mountains, concentrations of ozone were elevated and potentially phytotoxic to forest vegetation. That study led to the establishment of new long-term studies on ecological changes in forests and other ecosystems caused by air pollution in the Retezat Mountains, Southern Carpathians, Romania and in the Tatra Mountains, Western Carpathians on the Polish-Slovak border. Both of these important mountain ranges have the status of national parks and are Man & the Biosphere Reserves. In the Retezat Mountains, the primary research objective was to evaluate how air pollution may affect forest health and biodiversity. The main research objective in the Tatra Mountains was to evaluate responses of natural and managed Norway spruce forests to air pollution and other stresses. Ambient concentrations of ozone (O-3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as forest health and biodiversity changes were monitored on densely distributed research sites. Initial monitoring of pollutants indicated low levels of O-3, SO2, and NOx in the Retezat Mountains, while elevated levels of O-3 and high deposition of atmospheric sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) have characterized the Tatra Mountains. In the Retezat Mountains, air pollution seems to have little effect on forest health; however, there was concern that over a long time, even low levels of pollution may affect biodiversity of this important ecosystem. In contrast, severe decline of Norway spruce has been observed in the Tatra Mountains. Although bark beetle seems to be the immediate cause of that decline, long-term elevated levels of atmospheric N and S depositions and elevated O-3 could predispose trees to insect attacks and other stresses. European and US scientists studied pollution deposition, soil and plant chemistry, O-3-sensitive plant species, forest insects, and genetic changes in the Retezat and Tatra Mountains. Results of these investigations are presented in a GIS format to allow for a better understanding of the changes and the recommendations for effective management in these two areas.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the effect of deforestation caused by environmental pollution on the chemical composition of stream waters draining the small catchments located in the Skrzyczne massif (Beskid Slaski, southern Poland). In the 1950-60s this area was subjected to heavy anthropogenic pressure with excessive deposition of sulfur and nitrogen compounds. It resulted in the damage to the stands and deforestation of the ridge fragments of the studied area. The study was conducted in the catchment of the Malinowski Stream and its two subcatchments: forested and deforested in 2013. Waters of the studied streams characterized by low conductivity and mineralization. In the ridge subcatchments they were slightly acidic and in the main catchment slightly alkaline. In all catchments anions were predominated by sulfates - with the largest in the deforested catchment (31% mval/L). Also nitrates had very large share in the structure of the chemical composition of water, particularly in the forested catchment (15% mval/L). Interestingly, there were low levels of bicarbonates, particularly in the ridge catchments, with their share lower than sulfates and nitrates. Cations in all streams were predominated by calcium. The structure of the chemical composition of water of the Malinowski Stream, expressed by the average share of individual ions was as follows: SO4-HCO3-NO3-CI-F-Ca-Na-Mg-K-NH4, and in the case of streams draining small ridge catchments: SO4-NO3-HCO3-CI-F-Ca-Na-Mg-K-NH4. Conductivity of water decreased together with increased water levels in streams during floods. In the deforested catchment this decrease was more evident. The reaction of nitrate concentration to the increase in water level was however different, as in the stream draining the forested catchment it decreased sharply, while in the deforested catchment it decreased slightly or remained at the similar level. In the dry periods the chemical composition of waters of the examined streams were subject to far less change than during the floods, with the changes of e.g. conductivity being much higher in the stream draining the forested catchment.

AB  - This study addresses and conceptualizes the possible dependence of ecosystem services on prevailing air and/or water flow processes and conditions, and particularly on the trajectories and associated spatial reach of these flows in carrying services from supply to demand areas in the landscape. The present conceptualization considers and accounts for such flow-dependence in terms of potential and actually realized service supply and demand, which may generally differ and must therefore be distinguished due to and accounting for the prevailing conditions of service carrier flows. We here concretize and quantify such flow-dependence for a specific landscape case (the Stockholm region, Sweden) and for two examples of regulating ecosystem services: local climate regulation and storm water regulation. For these service and landscape examples, we identify, quantify and map key areas of potential and realized service supply and demand, based for the former (potential) on prevailing relatively static types of landscape conditions (such as land-cover/use, soil type and demographics), and for the latter (realized) on relevant carrier air and water flows. These first-order quantification examples constitute first steps towards further development of generally needed such flow-dependence assessments for various types of ecosystem services in different landscapes over the world.

AB  - Soil organic matter not only affects soil properties and productivity but also has an essential role in global carbon (C) cycle. We studied changes in the topsoil C content of Finnish croplands using a dataset produced in nationwide soil monitoring. The monitoring network consisting of fields on both mineral and organic soils was established in 1974 and resampled in 1987, 1998, and 2009. Over the monitoring period from 1974 to 2009, cultivated soils showed a continuous decline in C concentration (gkg1). In organic soils, C concentration decreased at a mean rate of 0.20.3%yr1 relative to the existing C concentration. In mineral soils, the relative decrease was 0.4%yr1 corresponding to a C stock (kgm2) loss of 220kgha1yr1. The change in management practices in last decades toward increasing cultivation of annual crops has contributed to soil C losses noted in this study. The results, however, suggest that the C losses result partly from other processes affecting cultivated soils such as climatic change or the continuing long-term effect of forest clearance. We estimated that Finnish cropland soils store 161Tg carbon nationwide in the topmost 15cm of which 117Tg is in mineral soils. C losses from mineral soils can therefore total up to 0.5Tg yearly.

AB  - Climate change, higher levels of natural resource demands, and changing land use will likely lead to changes in vegetation configuration in the mountain regions. The aim of this study was to determine if the vegetation cover and composition have changed in the Swedish region of the Scandinavian Mountain Range, based on data from the long-term landscape biodiversity monitoring program NILS (National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden). Habitat type and vegetation cover were assessed in 1740 systematically distributed permanent field plots grouped into 145 sample units across the mountain range. Horvitz-Thompson estimations were used to estimate the present areal extension of the alpine and the mountain birch forest areas of the mountain range, the cover of trees, shrubs, and plants, and the composition of the bottom layer vegetation. We employed the data from two subsequent 5-year monitoring periods, 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, to determine if there have been any changes in these characteristics. We found that the extension of the alpine and the mountain birch forest areas has not changed between the inventory phases. However, the total tree canopy cover increased in the alpine area, the cover of graminoids and dwarf shrubs and the total cover of field vegetation increased in both the alpine area and the mountain birch forest, the bryophytes decreased in the alpine area, and the foliose lichens decreased in the mountain birch forest. The observed changes in vegetation cover and composition, as assessed by systematic data in a national and regional monitoring scheme, can validate the results of local studies, experimental studies, and models. Through benchmark assessments, monitoring data also contributes to governmental policies and land-management strategies as well as to directed cause and effect analyses.

AB  - Background: Dactylis glomerata (orchardgrass or cocksfoot) is a forage crop of agronomic importance comprising high phenotypic plasticity and variability. Although the genus Dactylis has been studied quite well within the past century, little is known about the genetic diversity and population patterns of natural populations from geographically distinct grassland regions in Europe. The objectives of this study were to test the ploidy level of 59 natural and semi-natural populations of D. glomerata, to investigate genetic diversity, differentiation patterns within and among the three geographic regions, and to evaluate selected populations for their value as genetic resources.
   Results: Among 1861 plants from 20 Swiss, 20 Bulgarian and 19 Norwegian populations of D. glomerata, exclusively tetraploid individuals were identified based on 29 SSR markers. The average expected heterozygosity (H-E,H-C) ranged from 0.44 to 0.59 and was highest in the Norwegian region. The total number of rare alleles was high, accounting for 59.9% of the amplified alleles. 80.82% of the investigated individuals could be assigned to their respective geographic region based on allele frequencies. Average genetic distances were low despite large geographic distances and ranged from D = 0.09 to 0.29 among populations.
   Conclusions: All three case study regions revealed high genetic variability of tetraploid D. glomerata within selected populations and numerous rare and localized alleles which were geographically unique. The large, permanent grassland patches in Bulgaria provided a high genetic diversity, while fragmented, semi-natural grassland in the Norwegian region provided a high amount of rare, localized alleles, which have to be considered in conservation and breeding strategies. Therefore, the selected grassland populations investigated conserve a large pool of genetic resources and provide valuable sources for forage crop breeding programs.

AB  - This is the first attempt to budget average current annual carbon (C) and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges and transfers in a subarctic landscape, the Lake Tornetrask catchment in northern Sweden. This is a heterogeneous area consisting of almost 4000 km 2 of mixed heath, birch and pine forest, and mires, lakes and alpine ecosystems. The magnitudes of atmospheric exchange of carbon in the form of the GHGs, CO2 and CH4 in these various ecosystems differ significantly, ranging from little or no flux in barren ecosystems over a small CO2 sink function and low rates of CH4 exchange in the heaths to significant CO2 uptake in the forests and also large emissions of CH4 from the mires and small lakes. The overall catchment budget, given the size distribution of the individual ecosystem types and a first approximation of run-off as dissolved organic carbon, reveals a landscape currently with a significant sink capacity for atmospheric CO2. This sink capacity is, however, extremely sensitive to environmental changes, particularly those that affect the birch forest ecosystem. Climatic drying or wetting and episodic events such as insect outbreaks may cause significant changes in the sink function. Changes in the sources of CH4 through increased permafrost melting may also easily change the sign of the current radiative forcing, due to the stronger impact per gram of CH4 relative to CO2. Hence, to access impacts on climate, the atmospheric C balance alone has to be weighed in a radiative forcing perspective. When considering the emissions of CH4 from the mires and lakes as CO2 equivalents, the Tornetrask catchment is currently a smaller sink of radiative forcing, but it can still be estimated as representing the equivalent of approximately 14 000 average Swedish inhabitants' emissions of CO2. This can be compared with the carbon emissions of less than 200 people who live permanently in the catchment, although this comparison disregards substantial emissions from the non-Swedish tourism and transportation activities.

AB  - Agriculture in Norway makes a significant contribution to the country's emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Although it accounts for only 0.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product, it is estimated to account for roughly 9 percent of total GHG emissions. Norwegian agriculture is dominated by livestock production; ruminants (cattle and sheep) are particularly important. There are opportunities for GHG mitigation under existing technology, both through changes in agricultural practices and through sequestration activities, particularly agro-forestry. Using a detailed economic model based on representative farms we assess the impact of a targeted reduction of 30 percent in GHG emissions on agricultural activity the continuation of which is a key policy objective in Norway. Implications of mitigation are examined both for a representative dairy farm and for the sector as a whole.
   The imposition of a CO2 tax on agricultural activity would result in a reduction of agricultural production in Norway, particularly for GHG-intensive commodities such as beef and sheepmeat. Focusing on a representative dairy farm we conclude that measures that facilitate higher intensity and yields in Norwegian milk production would make it possible to cut emissions per unit of milk. For the agricultural sector as a whole, there would be an extensification of production and emissions per hectare would decline. In contrast, if farmers were rewarded for carbon sequestration activities (specifically agro-forestry) this would lead to intensification, as more inputs are applied to the land remaining in agriculture. Emissions per unit of agricultural land would increase but would decline per unit of output. For a given targeted reduction in agricultural GHG emissions, overall production can be kept highest under an intensification strategy.
   Although the numerical results are specific to the Norwegian setting, they are illustrative of issues facing other countries whose agriculture is dominated by ruminants. They are also supportive of arguments made by others that if global agriculture is to meet the needs of an expanding world population while simultaneously contributing to mitigation of GHG emissions, changes in the structure of production and intensification will be required.

AB  - To understand the complex mechanisms behind the recent biodiversity decline, it is necessary to complement traditional biological and ecological studies with studies of the economic, historic, and social contexts related to biodiversity loss, We used the completeness of the woodpecker guild as a biodiversity indicator to test the hypothesis that forest biodiversity in Europe is inversely related to the degree of urban-economic development. We related woodpecker diversity to several socioeconomic indices in 20 central European countries where the basic physiogeographic conditions are similar. As predicted, woodpecker diversity was low in highly developed countries with a long history of intensive land use, whereas in less-developed, peripheral countries, the woodpecker diversity was much higher and no species had been lost. The negative correlation between the degree of urbanization and woodpecker diversity was interpreted as a causal link between neotechnological landscape degradation and the decline of biodiversity. We discuss, and reject, alternative hypotheses related to the slow postglacial dispersal of species and climatic differences between western and eastern Europe that might explain the observed pattern of woodpecker diversity. The relative importance of particular woodpecker species for the level of woodpecker diversity shows that species depending on naturally dynamic temperature forests are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic changes. Finally, we stress the importance of bolistic studies on biodiversity, including ecological, geographical, and social issues, and we encourage specialists and practitioners from different disciplines to examine the European east-west gradient to learn how to avoid the same biodiversity loss in the East that has afflicted the West.

AB  - Trade-offs and synergies in the supply of forest ecosystem services are common but the drivers of these relationships are poorly understood. To guide management that seeks to promote multiple services, we investigated the relationships between 12 stand-level forest attributes, including structure, composition, heterogeneity and plant diversity, plus 4 environmental factors, and proxies for 14 ecosystem services in 150 temperate forest plots. Our results show that forest attributes are the best predictors of most ecosystem services and are also good predictors of several synergies and trade-offs between services. Environmental factors also play an important role, mostly in combination with forest attributes. Our study suggests that managing forests to increase structural heterogeneity, maintain large trees, and canopy gaps would promote the supply of multiple ecosystem services. These results highlight the potential for forest management to encourage multifunctional forests and suggest that a coordinated landscape-scale strategy could help to mitigate trade-offs in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - For many deep-rooted resource conflicts where the cultural component of ecosystem services (ES) is strong, standard monetary valuation may be methodologically difficult and not always meaningful. A deeper understanding of the value plurality of key stakeholders may be called for to develop acceptable policies. We use the Q method to analyse the perceived and actual trade-offs related to Norwegian wildlife management, a source of prominent conflict in Norway. We identify and classify distinct arguments in the wildlife management debate following the ES framework, and use the Q method to explore extant/prominent narratives characterising stakeholders' perceptions of the importance of arguments about biodiversity and ES. Finally, we reflect on whether and to what extent the Q method can contribute to our understanding of resource conflicts, underlying values, and ES trade-offs. Three clear narratives appeared: Pro-sheep grazing (cultural), pro-carnivore conservation (intrinsic) and a middle position emphasising recreational hunting (utilitarian). Despite considerable disagreement among narratives, the Q analysis also revealed areas of common ground useful for developing acceptable policies. Given the inherent complexity of socio-ecological systems, it is useful to draw from a diverse toolbox of methods, including the Q method for ES analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Albedo change during feedstock production can substantially alter the life cycle climate impact of bioenergy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have compared the effects of albedo and greenhouse gases (GHGs) based on global warming potential (GWP). However, using GWP leads to unequal weighting of climate forcers that act on different timescales. In this study, albedo was included in the time-dependent LCA, which accounts for the timing of emissions and their impacts. We employed field-measured albedo and life cycle emissions data along with time-dependent models of radiative transfer, biogenic carbon fluxes and nitrous oxide emissions from soil. Climate impacts were expressed as global mean surface temperature change over time ( increment T) and as GWP. The bioenergy system analysed was heat and power production from short-rotation willow grown on former fallow land in Sweden. We found a net cooling effect in terms of increment T per hectare (-3.8 x 10(-11) K in year 100) and GWP(100) per MJ fuel (-12.2 g CO(2)e), as a result of soil carbon sequestration via high inputs of carbon from willow roots and litter. Albedo was higher under willow than fallow, contributing to the cooling effect and accounting for 34% of GWP(100), 36% of increment T in year 50 and 6% of increment T in year 100. Albedo dominated the short-term temperature response (10-20 years) but became, in relative terms, less important over time, owing to accumulation of soil carbon under sustained production and the longer perturbation lifetime of GHGs. The timing of impacts was explicit with increment T, which improves the relevance of LCA results to climate targets. Our method can be used to quantify the first-order radiative effect of albedo change on the global climate and relate it to the climate impact of GHG emissions in LCA of bioenergy, alternative energy sources or land uses.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in public valuation for forest ecosystem services in policymaking. This paper investigates the public's perception of the Czech forest ecosystem services, i.e., provisioning, regulating and cultural services, with associated factors (changes in forest cover, production, and respondents' characteristics). The performance perception of forest ecosystem services was gathered from a nationwide survey in 2020. The Coordination of Information on the Environment Land Cover information in 2000 and 2018 was used for observation of forest cover changes. Coniferous and non-coniferous (broadleaved) roundwood, mushroom, and bilberry production data from the observed years were acquired from the Czech Statistical Office and the Ministry of Agriculture's annual nationwide surveys. The Bohemia vs. Moravia study areas were also statistically compared. Predictor analysis of the high score of performance perception from individual and cluster forest ecosystems was also performed to answer the research objectives. The group of forest provisioning services received high scores in public evaluation (from 3.9 to 4.2), followed by regulating services (mean range: 3.7-4.1). The highest score was found in forest as a natural habitat for wild animals and plants (mean: 4.6). However, the lowest value was the esthetic value (mean: 2.3). Both are categorized as forest cultural services. The broadleaved and mixed forest areas in 2018 were significantly higher than in 2000, especially in Bohemia. Meanwhile, the total coniferous forested region in 2018 declined substantially compared to 2000 (p = 0.030), especially in Moravian areas. A significantly higher total production of the coniferous and broadleaved roundwood removals in 2018 than in 2000 was reported, in contrast to a marked decrease in collected mushrooms and bilberries. The high score of performance perception of forests as the wood provisioning service was positively and significantly associated with the changes in broadleaved roundwood removals. Older-age and female respondents were the primary predictors of the studied cluster and individual forest ecosystem services. The findings indicate that the social value of the individual forest provisioning services supports the implementation of multi-species and multi-purpose forests; hence, it encourages the implementation of the current Czech forest policy.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable salmonid aquaculture industry, the environmental impacts of chemicals used to treat sea lice (Caligidae) infestations need to be considered. Our ability to assess the risks associated with these treatments in relation to human and wildlife health is limited by the lack of information on their concentrations in marine coastal environments. Diflubenzuron and teflubenzuron are chitin synthesis inhibiting insecticides frequently used to treat sea lice infestations on Norwegian salmon farms. In the present study, the distribution, persistence and bioaccumulation of both compounds were assessed in marine sediments and benthic macrofauna collected at four Norwegian aquacultures sites. Both compounds were detected in sediments sampled at 30-1400 m from the selected farms and 8-22 months after the last treatments took place. Diflubenzuron was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in 76% of sediment samples and measured levels ranged between 2.4 and 257 mu g/kg dry weight (dw). Teflubenzuron was detected above the LOQ in 92% of sediment samples, at concentrations ranging between 1.3 and 3474 mu g/kg dw. In all samples where diflubenzuron and teflubenzuron were detected, the measured levels exceeded the Norwegian environmental quality standards (EQS(sediment); 0.2 and 0.0004 mu g/kg dw, respectively), indicating that these compounds may pose a risk to benthic marine species living near fish farms. Both compounds were detected in wild fauna collected near the selected aquaculture sites with measured residue levels in the low micro-gramme per kilogramme wet weight range. The residue levels detected in economically important species caught for human consumption, such as pink shrimp (Pandalus montagui) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), were substantially lower than biota EQS's and maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the EU for salmon tissue. Further studies are needed to fully understand the ecological impacts of these compounds in the marine environment, with the potential for lethal and sub-lethal effects to occur in non-target organisms following chronic exposures.

AB  - Worldwide semi-natural habitats of high biological value are in decline. Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of "adaptive management", where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway's Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.

AB  - Soil quality is declining in many parts of the world, with implications for the productivity, resilience and sustainability of agri-food systems. Research suggests multiple causes of soil degradation with no single solution and a divided stakeholder opinion on how to manage this problem. However, creating socially acceptable and effective policies to halt soil degradation requires engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders who possess different and complementary knowledge, experiences and perspectives. To understand how British and Norwegian agricultural stakeholders perceived the causes of and solutions to soil degradation, we used Q-methodology with 114 respondents, including farmers, scientists and agricultural advisers. For the UK, respondents thought the causes were due to loss of soil structure, soil erosion, compaction and loss of organic matter; the perceived solutions were to develop more collaborative research between researchers and farmers, invest in training, improve trust between farmers and regulatory agencies, and reduce soil compaction. In Norway, respondents thought soils were degrading due to soil erosion, monocultures and loss of soil structure; they believed the solutions were to reduce compaction, increase rotation and invest in agricultural training. There was an overarching theme related to industrialised agriculture being responsible for declining soil quality in both countries. We highlight potential areas for land use policy development in Norway and the UK, including multi-actor approaches that may improve the social acceptance of these policies. This study also illustrates how Q-methodology may be used to co-produce stakeholder-driven policy options to address land degradation.

AB  - Roadsides, in particular those being species-rich and of conservation value, are considered to improve landscape permeability by providing corridors among habitat patches and by facilitating species' dispersal. However, little is known about the potential connectivity offered by such high-value roadsides. Using circuit theory, we modelled connectivity provided by high-value roadsides in landscapes with low or high permeability in southcentral Sweden, with 'permeability' being measured by the area of semi-natural grasslands. We modelled structural connectivity and, for habitat generalists and specialists, potential functional connectivity focusing on butterflies. We further assessed in which landscapes grassland connectivity is best enhanced through measures for expanding the area of high-value roadsides. Structural connectivity provided by high-value roadsides resulted in similar patterns to those of a functional approach, in which we modelled habitat generalists. In landscapes with low permeability, all target species showed higher movements within compared to between grasslands using high-value roadsides. In landscapes with high permeability, grassland generalists and specialists showed the same patterns, whereas for habitat generalists, connectivity provided by high-value roadsides and grasslands was similar. Increasing the ratio of high-value roadsides can thus enhance structural and functional connectivity in landscapes with low permeability. In contrast, in landscapes with high permeability, roadsides only supported movement of specialised species. Continuous segments of high-value roadsides are most efficient to increase connectivity for specialists, whereas generalists can utilize also short segments of high-value roadsides acting as stepping-stones. Thus, land management should focus on the preservation and restoration of existing seminatural grasslands. Management for enhancing grassland connectivity through high-value roadsides should aim at maintaining and creating high-value roadside vegetation, preferably in long continuous segments, especially in landscapes with low permeability.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change strongly affect biodiversity patterns and are assumed to be growing threats in the future. Particularly increasing urbanisation may affect species turnover and functional composition of biological communities. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of land-cover change in a medium-sized urban municipality from 2011 to 2018, and the effects of urbanisation on avian species- and functional diversity. The study was performed in Trondheim (Norway), using local land-cover maps and GBIF bird species occurrence records. GLMMs were used to model species turnover as a function of urbanisation, and the probability of species appearance and disappearance based on urbanisation and species traits. The extent of bird species turnover within a municipality-wide 500 x 500m(2) grid was not predicted by a changes in developed area, but the probability of disappearance and appearance of bird species varied with urbanisation and bird functional traits. Species associated with urban- or open areas showed a decreasing probability of disappearing and an increasing probability of appearing with increasing amount of developed area within grid cells. Similarly, granivorous species showed a decreasing probability of disappearing. Species feeding above ground-level showed positive responses to changes in land-cover. The probability of both appearance and disappearance, thus species turnover, increased with increasing longevity. Most functional groups respond negatively to increasing urbanisation, indicating a potential impoverishment of local avifauna with future land-cover modifications. Considering planned future land-cover changes within the municipality, the local avian communities are in danger of homogenisation. The recommendations for local management are to minimise conversion of vulnerable habitats, such as wetlands and woodlands, in particular if these are converted to developed area.

AB  - Escapes of domesticated fish from aquaculture, followed by interbreeding with wild conspecifics, represent a threat to the genetic integrity and evolutionary trajectory of natural populations. Approximately fifty years of Atlantic salmon production has left an unprecedented legacy of widespread introgression of domesticated escapees in wild Norwegian populations. A major question, however, is whether current aquaculture practice will lead to additional introgression in the near future. As part of the updated Norwegian risk assessment of fish farming, we conducted a risk assessment for further introgression of domesticated escapees in wild populations in Norway. Extensive data of reported numbers of escapees, observed proportions of escapees in rivers, removal of escapees pre-spawning, and the resilience of wild populations through demographic and genetic status informed the risk assessment. The analysis revealed that rivers in 10 of the 13 aquaculture production zones covering Norway display a moderate or high risk of further introgression of domesticated escapees. This comes in addition to widespread introgression that is already documented. We therefore conclude that so long as aquaculture production continues at its present level and form, there is a moderate-to-high risk of further introgression of domesticated salmon in many native populations throughout much of Norway.

AB  - Subarctic ecohydrological processes are changing rapidly, but detailed and integrated ecohydrological investigations are not as widespread as necessary. We introduce an integrated research catchment site (Pallas) for atmosphere, ecosystems, and ecohydrology studies in subarctic conditions in Finland that can be used for a new set of comparative catchment investigations. The Pallas site provides unique observational data and high-intensity field measurement datasets over long periods. The infrastructure for atmosphere- to landscape-scale research in ecosystem processes in a subarctic landscape has recently been complemented with detailed ecohydrological measurements. We identify three dominant processes in subarctic ecohydrology: (a) strong seasonality drives ecohydrological regimes, (b) limited dynamic storage causes rapid stream response to water inputs (snowmelt and intensive storms), and (c) hydrological state of the system regulates catchment-scale dissolved carbon dynamics and greenhouse (GHG) fluxes. Surface water and groundwater interactions play an important role in regulating catchment-scale carbon balances and ecosystem respiration within subarctic peatlands, particularly their spatial variability in the landscape. Based on our observations from Pallas, we highlight key research gaps in subarctic ecohydrology and propose several ways forward. We also demonstrate that the Pallas catchment meets the need for sustaining and pushing the boundaries of critical long-term integrated ecohydrological research in high-latitude environments.

AB  - To understand the relationship between conservation measures and agricultural yields, we need to know the contributions of organisms to both ecosystem services and disservices. We studied the activity and contribution of birds and mammals to intermediate ecosystem services (predation of weed seeds or invertebrate pests) and disservices (predation of crop seeds or beneficial invertebrates) in southern Sweden between June and November 2016. We measured seed and invertebrate predation rates using trays placed in front of 32 wildlife cameras in 16 cereal fields with a local habitat contrast (8 fields adjacent to another crop field and 8 fields adjacent to a semi-natural grassland) and along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (amount of semi-natural grassland). Both activity and predation were dominated by small mammals (mainly rodents), yet only a few species contributed to predation services and disservices according to camera records. Small mammal activity and predation varied considerably over time. Small mammal activity was significantly higher at trays with crop seeds or beneficial invertebrate prey compared to trays with pest prey, and crop seed predation by small mammals was significantly higher than weed seed predation. In contrast, bird activity and predation did not differ significantly between resource types, but varied over time depending on the habitat contrast. Predation of animal prey by birds was highest after cereal harvest, independent of habitat contrast. Our study highlights that birds and in particular rodents provide important intermediate ecosystem services, but also disservices, which fluctuate strongly in intensity over time.

AB  - Timber production is an economically important provisioning ecosystem service in forests, but is often in conflict with the provision of other ecosystem services. In multifunctional forestry, the production of timber and non-timber ecosystem services should coexist in the same landscape. To this end, we explored the capacity of a boreal landscape to simultaneously produce collectable goods - bilberry (Vaccimium myrtillus L.), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis- idaea L.) and cep (Boletus edulis Bull.) - alongside timber revenues. We also identified optimal forest management plans to achieve this. Furthermore, we analyzed trade-offs between collectable good yields and timber production, as well as between their economic values. We ran forest growth simulations under seven alternative management regimes at a landscape level across 50-year planning horizons. Then, we used multi-objective optimization to explore trade-offs and identify optimal forest management plans. The results showed that the strongest trade-off was between bilberry and timber production, resulting in a large loss in timber revenues for a gain in bilberry production. However, the conflicts between other collectables and timber production were relatively small: it was possible to increase the provision of collectable goods 4-15% with small reductions (3-5%) from timber revenues. With careful forest planning, there is the potential to simultaneously produce high levels of collectable goods and timber revenues in the landscape.

AB  - Picea koraiensis is major silvicultural and timber species in northeast China, and its distribution area is an important transition zone for genus spruce migration. The degree of intraspecific differentiation of P. koraiensis is high, but population structure and differentiation mechanisms are not clear. In this study, 523,761 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in 113 individuals from 9 populations of P. koraiensis by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Population genomic analysis showed that P. koraiensis was divided into three geoclimatic regions: Great Khingan Mountains climatic region, Lesser Khingan Mountains climatic region, and Changbai Mountain climatic region. Mengkeshan (MKS) population on the northern edge of the distribution area and Wuyiling (WYL) population located in the mining area are two highly differentiated groups. Selective sweep analysis showed that MKS and WYL populations had 645 and 1126 selected genes, respectively. Genes selected in the MKS population were associated with flowering and photomorphogenesis, cellular response to water deficit, and glycerophospholipid metabolism; genes selected in the WYL population were associated with metal ion transport, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and DNA repair. Climatic factors and heavy metal stress drives divergence in MKS and WYL populations, respectively. Our findings provide insights into adaptive divergence mechanisms in Picea and will contribute to molecular breeding studies.

AB  - Questions Primary forests fulfil important roles in preserving biodiversity, storing carbon and increasing ecological understanding. Yet, they have become very rare in Europe. An important policy goal is thus to increase the share of naturally developing forests by creating protected areas in formerly managed forests. Here, we investigated: (a) if and how such forests return to conditions similar to old-growth; and (b) whether recently observed stand-replacing natural disturbances in combination with climate change set them onto an alternative developmental pathway. Location Durrenstein Wilderness Area (IUCN Cat. Ib) in the Austrian Alps, containing the Rothwald, one of the last primary forest remnants of Central Europe. Methods We built a chronosequence of 87 plots, spanning 220 years of forest development after the cessation of management, and compared them to old-growth forests. We analysed the recovery of nine attributes of forest composition, structure and functioning. To evaluate stand-level development of these attributes after recent natural disturbance and climate change, we additionally used a process-based simulation model. Results Old-growth forests showed a wide range of variability across investigated attributes. Forests converged to old-growth conditions after management ceased, with seven out of the nine attributes falling within the range of old-growth at the end of our chronosequence. The variation in tree diameters and the downed amount of deadwood were, however, still significantly lower than in old-growth forests after 220 years of unmanaged stand development. Simulations did not indicate an alternative developmental pathway of recently disturbed stands. Conclusions While a full return to old-growth conditions can take centuries, a number of important forest attributes recover quickly, indicating that protecting formerly managed forests is a valuable strategy to enrich forest landscapes. Our results indicate that the mountain forests of Central Europe have high ecological resilience, developing towards old-growth conditions after both past management and current natural disturbance.

AB  - To mitigate climate change, several European countries have launched policies to promote the development of a renewable resource-based bioeconomy. These bioeconomy strategies plan to use renewable biological resources, which will increase timber and biomass demands and will potentially conflict with multiple other ecosystem services provided by forests. In addition, these forest ecosystem services (FES) are also influenced by other, different, policy strategies, causing a potential mismatch in proposed management solutions for achieving the different policy goals. We evaluated how Norwegian forests can meet the projected wood and biomass demands from the international market for achieving mitigation targets and at the same time meet nationally determined targets for other FES. Using data from the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) we simulated the devel-opment of Norwegian forests under different management regimes and defined different forest policy scenarios, according to the most relevant forest policies in Norway: national forest policy (NFS), biodiversity policy (BIOS), and bioeconomy policy (BIES). Finally, through multi-objective optimization, we identified the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario. The results for all scenarios indicated that Norway will be able to satisfy wood demands of up to 17 million m3 in 2093. However, the policy objectives for FES under each scenario caused substantial differences in terms of the management regimes selected. We observed that BIES and NFS resulted in very similar forest management programs in Norway, with a dominance of extensive management regimes. In BIOS there was an increase of set aside areas and continuous cover forestry, which made it more compatible with biodiversity indicators. We also found multiple synergies and trade-offs between the FES, likely influenced by the definition of the policy targets at the national scale.

AB  - Purpose of the ReviewImproved forest management is a promising avenue for climate change mitigation. However, we lack synthetic understanding of how different management actions impact aboveground carbon stocks, particularly at scales relevant for designing and implementing forest-based climate solutions. Here, we quantitatively assess and review the impacts of three common practices-application of inorganic NPK fertilizer, interplanting with N-fixing species, and thinning-on aboveground carbon stocks in plantation forests.Recent FindingsSite-level empirical studies show both positive and negative effects of inorganic fertilization, interplanting, and thinning on aboveground carbon stocks in plantation forests. Recent findings and the results of our analysis suggest that these effects are heavily moderated by factors such as species selection, precipitation, time since practice, soil moisture regime, and previous land use. Interplanting of N-fixing crops initially has no effect on carbon storage in main tree crops, but the effect becomes positive in older stands. Conversely, the application of NPK fertilizers increases aboveground carbon stocks, though the effect lessens with time. Moreover, increases in aboveground carbon stocks may be partially or completely offset by emissions from the application of inorganic fertilizer. Thinning results in a strong reduction of aboveground carbon stocks, though the effect lessens with time.Management practices tend to have strong directional effects on aboveground carbon stocks in plantation forests but are moderated by site-specific management, climatic, and edaphic factors. The effect sizes quantified in our meta-analysis can serve as benchmarks for the design and scoping of improved forest management projects as forest-based climate solutions. Overall, management actions can enhance the climate mitigation potential of plantation forests, if performed with sufficient attention to the nuances of local conditions.

AB  - Some regions like Europe have experienced a net gain in forest areas over the last decades, but intact areas of natural forests are declining worldwide, accompanied by changes in forest ecosystem functions and benefits to humans. We conduct a biophysical assessment of trends, condition, and drivers of change of forest ecosystem services in Norway from 1950 to 2020. Four main results are highlighted. First, industrial forestry, large scale measures of re-and afforestation, and infrastructure development (e.g., roads and recreational homes) have been the main direct drivers of forest transformation. Second, deep transformations in the Norwegian economy shaped trends of forest ecosystem services over the study period. Third, with the shifts towards the tertiary (service) sector and the mechanization of forestry, the economic and material relations between forests and local com-munities are waning. Overall, people's primary relationships to forests have shifted from livelihood to recreation. Fourth, forest management in Norway has largely favored provisioning services at the expense of supporting services and some cultural and regulating services. Consequently, while Norwegian forests retain strong capacity to deliver provisioning services, the overall ecological condition is relatively poor. Our assessment provides an approach to identify and explain trends of ecosystem services at a national scale, over a long period of time. We argue that growth in forest area and biomass are insufficient indicators for sustainable forest management, and that future forest polices would benefit from improved knowledge on forests ecological condition, resilience against climate change, and socio-cultural contributions to human well-being.

AB  - The Lofoten Islands in northern Norway face challenges from increasing visitor numbers, congestion, environmental impacts, and growing host-visitor tensions. Benefits include increased local employment and growing revenues. Future tourism policy requires better documentation of the non-economic benefits and values associated with tourism in Lofoten; this information is important to the development of policy and management processes. We conducted 45 in-depth interviews with domestic and international visitors, using the cultural ecosystem services (ES) framework to ascertain the core elements of the tourism experience, as well as views on management needs and development. We probed reflections on place, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, inspiration, social relations, cultural heritage, knowledge, spirituality, and identity by offering a combination of statements and questions. All these categories of cultural ES were important to most visitors. However, the importance of the landscape was paramount. Policy implications include the need to include landscape in ES assessments, to map places of especially high scenic value, and to use the ES framework more extensively to identify and compare non-economic and economic tourism values and benefits.

AB  - European forest management practices create broad-scale mosaics of tree-species composition and developmental stages, inducing gradients in environmental conditions at landscape scales. However, consistent effects of specific forest-management types on general characteristics of soil microarthropod assemblages could not always be determined. This study aimed to reveal generalizable effects of similar forest-conversion measures using collembolan data extracted from the German soil-zoological data warehouse "Edaphobase". Data of collembolan assemblages and environmental variables from forest-conversion studies were analyzed from three forest types - deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests in two German regions (a northern and a southern) with various sites in two areas each. We hypothesized that forest management has a strong effect on soil Collembola and the different forest types induce consistently dissimilar assemblages independent of region. Abundance, diversity and species richness of collembolan assemblages were compared between forest types. Community composition was analysed with cluster analysis and canonical ordinations to reveal similarity patterns and the driving environmental variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, forest conversion caused only small differences in quantitative community variables, most likely due to site-specific influences and high variability. More than a third of the considered species showed preferences for stands with either deciduous or coniferous trees. The collembolan assemblages of the two regions differed from each other, indicating separate species pools. Nonetheless, as opposed to the quantitative metrics, different species compositions did consistently occur between forest types across regions, revealing a gradient from deciduous over mixed to coniferous stands. Collembolan assemblages were primarily associated with dominant tree species (forest stands) and humus forms, while quantitative environmental parameters had low explanatory power. Therefore, forestry measures induce qualitative differences in the soil-habitat, leading to habitat-specific environmental filtering of the regional collembolan species pools and a mosaic of soil microarthropod communities at the landscape level.

AB  - Transition to a sustainable society requires large-scale conversion of the energy system to new, renewable, non-fossil sources of energy. This presupposes public support for new technologies, which means the public must deal with challenges in terms of placement, area requirements, ecological degradation and price developments. This paper discusses how citizens view renewable energy technologies. It analyses responses to representative surveys of the Norwegian population on the desirability of various energy technologies such as hydroelectric dams, onshore and offshore wind energy, bioenergy plants and, for contrast, gas plants with and without carbon capture and storage. Our main focus is on the influence of party political preference on views of renewable energy. We find that the sometimes lukewarm enthusiasm for renewable energy technologies cannot be fully explained by existing theories and that political party preference has a larger impact on energy technology attitudes than previously believed.

AB  - The Arctic is experiencing an increased frequency of extreme events which can cause landscape-scale vegetation damage. Extreme event-driven damage is an important driver of the decline in vegetation productivity (termed 'Arctic browning') which has become an increasingly important component of pan-Arctic vegetation change in recent years. A limited number of studies have demonstrated that event-driven damage can have major impacts on ecosystem CO(2)balance, reducing ecosystem carbon sink strength. However, although there are many different extreme events that cause Arctic browning and different ecosystem types that are affected, there is no understanding of how impacts on CO(2)fluxes might vary between these, or of whether commonalities in response exist that would simplify incorporation of extreme event-driven Arctic browning into models. To address this, the impacts of different extreme events (frost-drought, extreme winter warming, ground icing and a herbivore insect outbreak) on growing season CO(2)fluxes of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) were assessed at five sites from the boreal to High Arctic (64 degrees N-79 degrees N) in mainland Norway and Svalbard. Event-driven browning had consistent, major impacts across contrasting sites and event drivers, causing site-level reductions of up to 81% of NEE, 51% of GPP and 37% of R-eco. Furthermore, at sites where plot-level NDVI (greenness) data were obtained, strong linear relationships between NDVI and NEE were identified, indicating clear potential for impacts of browning on CO(2)balance to be consistently, predictably related to loss of greenness across contrasting types of events and heathland ecosystems. This represents the first attempt to compare the consequences of browning driven by different extreme events on ecosystem CO(2)balance, and provides an important step towards a better understanding of how ecosystem CO(2)balance will respond to continuing climate change at high latitudes.

AB  - There has been a long-term decline in spring and fall numbers of Clethrionomys rufocanus in boreal Sweden in 1971-2005. Previous studies on permanent sampling plots in the centre of 2.5 x 2.5 km landscapes suggested that habitat fragmentation (sensu destruction) could have contributed to the decline. Therefore, we tested these findings in a field study and compared trapping results on the central sampling plots of landscapes with a low degree of fragmentation (LDF) and of "hot spot" type with trapping results in managed forest landscapes with a high degree of fragmentation (HDF). We predicted that C. rufocanus would be more common on the LDF plots. We used our permanent plots supplemented with a new sample of plots, mainly of the rare LDF type, inside or just outside the long-term study area. Very few voles were trapped on both plot types, and no difference was found. However, a subsequent pilot study with trapping in a national park with large areas of pristine, unfragmented forest yielded more voles than in the managed, more fragmented, areas. Consequently, the initial field study data and some other recent data were also re-analysed from a "local patch quality" perspective. This alternative approach revealed the positive importance of large focal patches of forest > 60 years old and their content of old-growth (pine) forest (> 100 years). Interestingly, at the landscape level, the frequency distribution of patches of forest > 60 years old, old-growth (> 100 years), and especially of old-growth pine forest (> 100 years), relative to the properties of plots with C. rufocanus, suggested that there are few forest patches left that are suitable for C. rufocanus. Our current results suggest that habitat fragmentation cannot be excluded as a contributing cause to the long-term decline of C. rufocanus in boreal Sweden.

AB  - Land use change is a continuously on-going process that has many impacts on the environmental footprint of agriculture and especially on the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. This study used field scale data from 1995 to 2011 (165,760 field parcels) on a study region that represents the prime crop production area of Finland, to assess how agricultural land use has changed since the launching of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Six five-year crop rotation types were identified: cereal species monoculture, cereal monoculture, rotation with a break-crop, diverse crop rotation, perennial, non-permanent grassland rotation and environmental fallow rotation. Shifts in the frequencies of different crop rotation types and composition of their crop species were monitored. Furthermore, the contribution of different field characteristics, on a farmer's land allocation to different rotation types, was assessed. The ultimate goal was to understand whether land use changes, in general, have contributed to any increase in heterogeneity of landscapes and whether they have impacted diversity of crop rotation types. We found that different crop rotation types were applied on a farm, but that farmers have quite consistent drivers for land allocation to different rotation types; although, economic incentives influence the introduction, expansion and/or withdrawal of crops from rotations. The farmers' readiness to implement land use changes was dependent on farm size. There has been a shift towards lower shares of cereal species.monocultures, grassland rotations and diverse crop rotations, while environmental fallow rotations have increased. According to the five-year rotation plans shared by 16 interviewed farmers, there was a noted desire for more diverse rotation types originating from adverse experiences with cereal monocultures and soil degradation; however, they were keen on reducing the number of environmental fallows and concentrating on food production. It is important to carry out follow-up studies to understand the impacts of the demonstrated and anticipated land use changes on biodiversity. Future policy development should benefit from a gained understanding of the drivers of farmers' decisions for facilitating unimpeded implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents political, economic and social background to establish the State Environmental Council of Poland (PROS) as well as main activities and personal composition of this body. The PROS has been legally enforced by the "Environmental Act" and acts as an advisory body to the Minister of Environment. The Council has been since 1999 accepted as an associated and since 2002 as a full member of the network of European Environmental and Sustainable Development Advisory Councils (EEAC). Its permanent activity is carried on by six working groups: (1) Energy and Global Warming; (2) Agriculture; (3) Costal Zones and Fishery; (4) Environmental Governing, (5) Sustainable Development and (6) Biodiversity. The PROS mirrored this activities by establishing the same WGs in its internal structure The PROS consists of 25 members in the current term (2001/2006). They are meeting at plenary sessions (4 yearly) at which apart from presenting papers on crucial general issues some selected key environmental problems are considered to give an advice to the Minister to facilitate the decision making process.
   For two years PROS has been serving apprenticeship for hosting the annual EEAC summit linked usually with the thematic conference. The last plenary annual session in Berlin recommended entrusting Poland organization of the summit in the year 2006, in organizational cooperation with the Finnish council, because Finland at this period will take over leadership of UE. The Minister of the Environment proposed issues of the conference, associated with the summit: Balanced forest management. Event, obout those issues, in the obvious way should take place in closeness of forest areas and it was recognized, that best,its localization would be Karkonosze complex, which is still curing wounds after the invasion of acid rains of the Black Triangle, that in 70 divided by 80's damaged the Karkonoski National Park in a large degree.

AB  - The transition to a fossil-free society in Sweden is expected to cause an increased demand for forest-derived products which may intensify existing conflicts between forest ecosystem services. This study investigated the preferences among non-industrial private forest owners for maintaining multiple forest ecosystem services and their preferences for future forest development. The findings were related to their prioritizations for and knowledge of forest management. The study results were generated through the means of a survey which revealed a consistent high valuation among all respondents of ecosystem services relating to water quality, timber quality, recreation, and biodiversity. A majority of the respondents desired increasing proportions of mixed species and broadleaved stands within the future forest landscape. Certified forest owners who were members of a forest owner association (CMs) prioritized achieving high economic income through roundwood production with strong preferences for the ecosystem services high stand growth and high timber quality. For CMs, carbon substitution was the preferred means of mitigating climate change. Forest owners lacking both certification and membership in a forest owner association ranked the ecosystem services recreation and biodiversity significantly higher, and also preferred retaining more old forest within the landscape. The survey results revealed a higher management activity among CMs, resulting in a more frequent establishment of mixed and broadleaved stands. Forest owners with medium to large scale properties were well-represented within the CM category. The results indicated that while the CMs have stronger preferences for roundwood production compared to owners of small properties, they are also more likely to have taken adaptive measures favoring risk management and biodiversity.

AB  - In the last decades, we observed significant changes in the tree species composition in all layers of close-to-natural stands. Since the 1970s, the Forest Research Institute has collected and stored dataset from stand measurements, phytosociological and other research that are the basis for the long-term monitoring of vegetation. The aim of the research was to determine the directions of changes in the species composition and structure of tree stands, and to analyze the changes in the species composition of natural regeneration growing without human interference in various forest communities in the period of about 40 years. From 2014 to 2017, 40 permanent plots of 0.25 ha were re-measured in the nature reserves of the Knyszyn and Augustow Forests (NE Poland). The diameter of all trees was measured and the trees of the natural regeneration and bushes up to 1.3 m high were counted. The stand similarity index (S) between successive measurements was calculated. The analysis of differences in the composition of tree stands in subsequent measurements was carried out using Student t and Kruskal-Wallis tests. In the species composition of fresh coniferous forest stands and fresh mixed coniferous forest, there were significant changes in the number and share of Scots pine and Norway spruce. In the Knyszyn Forest a significant decrease in the share of spruce was observed. However, an increase in the share of deciduous species was remarkable. An inhibition of the natural pine renewal process and increase in density of spruce regeneration was observed. It is necessary to emphasize the significant expansion of hornbeam in a fresh mixed deciduous forest in the Knyszyn Forest and expansion of hazel in the Augustow Forest. Mean basal area in the forest stands has increased. The similarity index between the beginning and the end of the research reached the value of 0.73-0.94. 'The species composition and density of natural regenerations created without human intervention are not satisfactory from the point of view of forest sustainability. The most important factor affecting the direction and rate of changes in the species composition of tree stands is the expansion of hornbeam and/or hazel. These species cause changes in the ecological conditions of the lowest forest layers, leading to the unification of the species composition of forest communities.

AB  - Investigations of land management impacts on hydrology are well developed in South-East Asia, having been greatly extended by national organizations in the last two decades. Regional collaborative efforts, such as the ASEAN-US watershed programme, have helped develop skills and long-running monitoring programmes. Work in different countries is significant for particular aspects: the powerful effects of both cyclones and landsliding in Taiwan, the significance of lahars in Java, of small-scale agriculture in Thailand and plantation establishment in Malaysia. Different aid programmes have contributed specialist knowledge such as British work on reservoir sedimentation, Dutch, Swedish and British work on softwood plantations and US work in hill-tribe agriculture. Much has been achieved through individual university research projects, including PhD and MSc theses. The net result is that for most countries there is now good information on changes in the rainfall-run-off relationship due to forest disturbance or conversion, some information on the impacts on sediment delivery and erosion of hillslopes, but relatively little about the dynamics and magnitude of nutrient losses. Improvements have been made in the ability to model the consequences of forest conversion and of selective logging and exciting prospects exist for the development of better predictions of transfer of water from the hillslopes to the stream channels using techniques such as multilevel modelling. Understanding of the processes involved has advanced through the detailed monitoring made possible at permanent field stations such as that at Danum Valley, Sabah.

AB  - Fast-growing Populus species are becoming frequently used at afforestation of arable land globally and hybrid aspen is promising for short rotation forestry in the northern hemisphere. Knowledge about growth performance of the second- generation plantations, i.e., consisting of root sucker generated shoots after clearcutting of the original stand, is increasing, but less information is available on the effects on soil properties, especially with varying management. We followed the soil effects of three different management regimes, including 4-, 8-and 16-year rotations with thinning measures in the two longer rotations, in root sucker generated hybrid aspen on former agricultural land. The study was performed in a randomized block design and changes in soil variables were estimated by repeated sampling, i.e., at root sucker initiation and after eight years. Concentrations and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nutrients, pH and bulk density were analysed in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm mineral soil. Common for all management regimes were unchanged SOC and nutrient pools; pH and bulk density were also unaffected during the study period. Afforestation effects on the vertical distribution of nutrients, i.e., redistribution of NH4-N, K and Mg from deeper to shallower soil by plant uptake and release through litter decomposition, were observed in all management regimes. A different effect was noted for NO3-N where a declining trend was observed. This could indicate a leakage of the ion, but NO3-N distributions in soils are variable which makes interpretations difficult. The results suggest that different management strategies have small initial effects on mineral soil characteristics. However, soil changes need to be followed for an extended period to get more information on the long-term impact of afforestation and management of root sucker generated stands.

AB  - Climate change can hamper sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry by amplifying and adding to other environmental challenges. In Norway, salmon lice-induced mortality in wild salmonid populations is identified as a major risk factor for further expansion. Higher temperatures will induce increased production of salmon lice larvae, decreased developmental time from non-infective nauplii to infectious copepods, and higher infectivity of copepodids. In a warmer climate, a modelling exercise shows how these three factors lead to a significant increase in the infection pressure from farmed to wild salmonids, where the infectivity of copepodids is the term with the highest sensitivity to temperature changes. The total infection pressure gradually increases with increasing temperature, with an estimated twofold if the temperature increases from 9 degrees C to 11 degrees C. Thus, making it even harder to achieve a sustainable expansion of the industry with rising water temperature. This study demonstrates how bio-hydrodynamic models might be used to assess the combined effects of future warmer climate and infection pressure from salmon lice on wild salmonids. The results can be used as an early warning for the fish-farmers, conservation stakeholders and the management authorities, and serve as a tool to test mitigation strategies before implementation of new management plans.

AB  - There has been a widespread push to incorporate ecosystem services (ES) in research and policy-making, yet ES have remained an expert-driven discourse not well integrated into hands-on planning and management, particularly at the more local levels. We carry out a retrospective investigation of an inter-municipal marine spatial planning (MSP) process in Northern Norway, where the allocation of new aquaculture locations was a core issue. At this local/regional scale, the concept of ES is hardly known. Thus, our approach is to investigate the documents of public consultation, where different stakeholders operating at different scales respond to the proposed planning document. By analyzing and 'translating' the consultation statements into the ES nomenclature, we find a rich and diverse basis for ES identification especially at the local level and within cultural and supporting services. More than 208 different ecosystem services were identified, two-thirds of the total number of services at the local scale. This supports the debate in the ES-science community, which has suggested greater inclusion of plural and context-specific perspectives on people's relationship to the environment. Our findings show that by doing so in MSP, municipal coastal planners may obtain tools that strengthen local democracy and include greater ES diversity and sustainability.

AB  - Ponds are important elements of green areas in cities that help counteract the negative consequences of urbanization, by providing important habitats for biodiversity in cities and being essential nodes in the overall landscape-scale habitat network. However, there is relatively little knowledge about the impacts of pond management intensity, function and environmental variables on urban pond biodiversity. In this study we addressed this gap by investigating which factors were correlated with the level of biodiversity in urban ponds, indicated by species richness of aquatic insects, in Stockholm, Sweden. Our study did not confirm any direct link between the perceived intensity of management or function of ponds and overall biodiversity. However, it seems that management can influence particular groups of species indirectly, since we found that Trichoptera richness (Caddisflies) was highest at intermediate management intensity. We suggest that this is caused by management of vegetation, as the amount of floating and emergent vegetation was significantly correlated with both the overall species richness and the richness of Trichoptera (Caddisflies). This relationship was non-linear, since ponds with an intermediate coverage of vegetation had the highest richness. Interestingly, the amount of vegetation in the pond was significantly affected by pond function and pond management. The overall species richness and richness of Trichoptera were also positively correlated with pond size. Since we found that the pattern of relations between species richness and environmental variables differed between the insect groups we suggest that it will be difficult to provide overall design and management recommendations for ponds in urban green areas. Therefore, it is recommended that to provide high aquatic diversity of species in urban areas one should aim at promoting high diversity of different types of ponds with differing management and environmental factors that shape them.

AB  - During the last century the boreal forests of south-eastern Norway have been converted into patchworks of agricultural areas, clear-cuts and even-aged conifer monocultures. Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics.
   At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals.
   Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity.
   Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals.
   Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are important spatial elements providing humans with recreational, esthetic, spiritual, and other benefits. Yet, because of their immaterial, subjective, qualitative, and unmeasurable nature, this means that scientists, decision-makers, and general public often find their value difficult to grasp. We enrich the CES approach with theoretical insights from humanist geography, where we frame CES as arising from perpetual interactions between humans and their environment. Places are formed through various processes, both organic and planned, which endow people with unique identities, experiences, capabilities, knowledge, and skills. We use the rural wetland area of Lake Hornborga, Sweden, with its complex history of restoration phases, to explore the profound interrelations between environmental spaces and cultural practices expressed in the everyday activities of learning, playing, creating, caring, producing, and consuming. The data was collected through qualitative methods, including interviews, observations, and a focused group interview, in order to capture these unique senses and experiences. Thefindings outline CES as key drivers behind the formation of place, rather than mere labels for inventorying benefits people receive from nature. The presence of the iconic migratory crane is especially conducive to a positive sense of place and the practice of various activities, including tourism, around the wetland. We frame the implications for planning and future research of our findings within a context of ethics.

AB  - In this discussion paper, we discuss what benefits Finnish citizens and companies can derive from forest data, and how the benefits of that data depend on rights to forests. Environmental protection, everyone's forest use, bioeconomy, and tourism may benefit from increased access to forest data. Access to forest data is a democratic right by itself. Forest data allow actors to derive more value from their existing forest rights and may spark demands for clarification or reformulation of forest rights. Transparency of forest data also allows voluntary trade in forest ecosystem services. Increased access to forest data may also contribute to forest-related conflicts, given that various, at times contradictory interests are directed at forests. At best, increased access to forest data and information may support the renewal of forest governance to become more democratic, legitimate, and effective.

AB  - Cold subarctic pond ecosystems will be threatened due to the increase in global temperatures. Therefore, it is important to gain more knowledge on how their biota may respond to global warming. The aim of this research was to illustrate the variability in diatom species richness and community composition along environmental gradients in northernmost Finland and Norway and reveal the variables most strongly associated with diatom biodiversity. We also compared diatom biodiversity among different biotope types and placed emphasis on the distribution of rare diatom taxa. A total of 100 subarctic ponds from the Finnish and Norwegian Lapland covering an elevational gradient of 8-887 m above sea level were sampled. A generalised linear model and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify variables associated with diatom species richness. To identify variables associated with diatom community composition, a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was performed. Finally, a principal component analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance were used for the investigation of environmental and biotic differences among biotope types. Water pH, aluminium concentration, and air temperature best explained the variation in species richness and community composition. Diatom species richness and community composition did not differ among the biotope types, but environmental variables in pine forests differed significantly from other biotope types. Many diatom species occupied the entire elevational gradient, while rare taxa seemed to appear at the ends of the elevational gradient as well around the mid-elevational zone. We found that elevation was not sufficient to explain the variation in diatom species richness and community composition, but diatom biodiversity was shaped by a variety of local-scale environmental variables, some of which are in turn correlated with elevation. Our findings suggest that local abiotic factors and especially water chemistry are important factors in describing the variability in diatom community composition and species richness in subarctic ponds. It seems that the lowest and the highest elevations provide suitable habitats for rare diatom taxa that have unique environmental preferences but some of the rare taxa were also constrained to mid elevations. Our study provides new insights into the role of local abiotic variables in shaping subarctic mountain pond biodiversity. We urge researchers not only to study elevational gradients per se in mountain areas, but also pay special attention to environmental covariates that may play a notable role in maintaining freshwater biodiversity in the subarctic.

AB  - Aim We investigated how current and historical land use and landscape structure affect species richness and the processes of extinction, immigration and species turnover. Location The northern part of the Stockholm archipelago, Baltic Sea, Sweden. We resurveyed 27 islands ranging from 0.3 to 33 ha in area. Methods We compared current plant survey data, cadastral maps and aerial photographs with records obtained from a survey in 1908, using databases and a digital elevation model to examine changes in plant community dynamics in space and time. We examined the effects of local and landscape structure and land use changes on plant species dynamics by using stepwise regression in relation to eight local and three landscape variables. The eight local variables were area, relative age, shape, soil heterogeneity, bedrock ratio, number of houses, forest cover change, and grazing 100 years ago. The three landscape variables were distance to mainland, distance to closest island with a farm 100 years ago, and structural connectivity. Hanskis connectivity measure was modified to incorporate both connectivity and fragmentation. Results The investigated islands have undergone drastic changes, with increasing forest cover, habitation, and abandonment of grassland management. Although the total species richness increased by 31% and mean island area by 23%, we found no significant increase in species richness per unit area. Local variables explain past species richness (100 years ago), whereas both local and landscape variables explain current species richness, extinctions, immigrations and species turnover. Grazing that occurred 100 years ago still influences species richness, even though grazing management was abandoned several decades ago. The evidence clearly shows an increase in nitrophilous plant species, particularly among immigrant species. Main conclusions This study highlights the importance of including land use history when interpreting current patterns of species richness. Furthermore, local environment and landscape patterns affect important ecological processes such as immigration, extinction and species turnover, and hence should be included when assessing the impact of habitat fragmentation and land use change. We suggest that our modified structural connectivity measure can be applied to other types of landscapes to investigate the effects of fragmentation and habitat loss.

AB  - Agriculture and forestry activities increase the deposition of fine sediments in river and streambeds, with negative consequences for biodiversity and stream ecosystem functioning. However, little is known about the economic value of headwater stream restoration and the associated improvement in ecosystem services. Here, we apply the contingent valuation method to assess the awareness, knowledge, and values held by different stakeholder groups regarding a change in the set of ecosystem services related to the restoration of sediment-stressed forest streams in a large boreal catchment. The majority of respondents (69%) place positive value on restoration. A multiple bound discrete choice (MBDC) format is applied and sensitivity analysis is carried out on willingness to pay (WTP) values with respect to preference uncertainty. Preference uncertainty related to willingness to support and pay for a forest stream restoration program is estimated and compared with ordered probit and non-parametric WTP models. According to our study, only 15% of the more than 450 respondents with a positive WTP are completely certain about their preferences. Higher preference certainty is significantly correlated with, for example, the stated easiness in revealing the household's WTP, trust in the restoration program, and support for the restoration of the living conditions of trout, in addition to a lower education level. Making restoration benefits more visible and involving the public and stakeholders in the projects could help in setting restoration targets, creating more effective plans with better public and stakeholder support, and establishing a stronger basis for the funding of restoration efforts.

AB  - Costa Rica has recently established a program that provides funds for reforestation and forest protection on private lands, partly through the sale of carbon certificates to industrialized countries. Countries purchasing these carbon offsets hope one day to receive credit against their own commitments to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. Costa Pica has used the proceeds of the sale of carbon offsets to Norway to help finance this forest incentive program. called the Private Forestry Project, which pays thousands of participants to reforest or protect forest on their lands. The Private Forestry Project is accompanied by a monitoring program conducted by Costa Rican forest engineers that seeks to determine net carbon storage accomplished on these lands each year. The Private Forestry Project, which is officially registered as an Activity implemented jointly. is a possible model for bundled projects funded by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It also serves as an interesting example for the CDM because it was designed by a developing country host--not by an industrialized country investor. Accordingly, it reflects the particular "sustainable development" objectives of the host country or at least the host planners. Early experience in implementing the Private Forestry Project is evaluated in light of the main objectives of the CDM and its precursor-Activities Implemented Jointly it is concluded that the project appears to meet the criteria of global cost-effectiveness and financing from non-ODA sources. The sustainable development implications of the project are specific to the region and would not necessarily match the ideals of all investing and developing countries. The project may be seen to achieve additional greenhouse gas abatement when compared against some (although not all) baselines.

AB  - P>Continuous stem radius changes (DR) include growth and water-related processes on the individual tree level. DR is assumed to provide carbon turnover information complementary to net ecosystem productivity (NEP) which integrates fluxes over the entire forest ecosystem. Here, we investigated the unexpectedly close relationship between NEP and DR and asked for causalities.
   NEP (positive values indicate carbon sink) measured by eddy covariance over 11 yr was analysed at three time scales alongside automated point dendrometer DR data from a Swiss subalpine Norway spruce forest.
   On annual and monthly scales, the remarkably close relationship between NEP and DR was positive, whereas on a half-hourly scale the relationship was negative. Gross primary production (GPP) had a similar explanatory power at shorter time scales, but was significantly less correlated with DR on an annual scale.
   The causal explanation for the NEP-DR relationship is still fragmentary; however, it is partially attributable to the following: radial stem growth with a strong effect on monthly and annual increases in NEP and DR; frost-induced bark tissue dehydration with a parallel decrease in both measures on a monthly scale; and transpiration-induced DR shrinkage which is negatively correlated with assimilation and thus with NEP on a half-hourly scale.

AB  - Traditionally, challenges of natural resource management have been addressed with a sectoral policy approach. However, it is increasingly recognised that different sectors are interconnected in a complex and mutually in-teracting system. A nexus approach is proposed to identify synergies and trade-offs between sectors and to foster the sustainable and efficient use of resources, particularly in light of climate change. The nexus approach has led to studies identifying interactions between policy objectives across nexus sectors, but the physical interactions between nexus sectors that can be the result of policy interactions, have received less attention. Nevertheless, such interactions can have severe consequences for the environment, affecting ecosystems and the services they provide. Integrating the nexus approach and the ecosystem service concept may help to better understand pressures and impacts related to a resource nexus and to address trade-offs. In this study, literature and expert assessment are used to analyse the water-energy-food-land-climate nexus in Sweden through the lens of the ecosystem services concept to gain insights into interactions between the nexus sectors. By demonstrating how anthropogenic pressures originating from the nexus sectors affect ecosystem functions and services, this paper serves as a foundation to further inform policy making (within and outside Sweden) when considering the water-energy-food-land-climate nexus.

AB  - Here we report details of the European research initiative "Soil Crust International" (SCIN) focusing on the biodiversity of biological soil crusts (BSC, composed of bacteria, algae, lichens, and bryophytes) and on functional aspects in their specific environment. Known as the so-called "colored soil lichen community" (Bunte Erdflechtengesellschaft), these BSCs occur all over Europe, extending into subtropical and arid regions. Our goal is to study the uniqueness of these BSCs on the regional scale and investigate how this community can cope with large macroclimatic differences. One of the major aims of this project is to develop biodiversity conservation and sustainable management strategies for European BSCs. To achieve this, we established a latitudinal transect from the Great Alvar of A-land, Sweden in the north over Gossenheim, Central Germany and Hochtor in the Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria down to the badlands of Tabernas, Spain in the south. The transect stretches over 20A degrees latitude and 2,300 m in altitude, including natural (Hochtor, Tabernas) and semi-natural sites that require maintenance such as by grazing activities (A-land, Gossenheim). At all four sites BSC coverage exceeded 30 % of the referring landscape, with the alpine site (Hochtor) reaching the highest cyanobacterial cover and the two semi-natural sites (A-land, Gossenheim) the highest bryophyte cover. Although BSCs of the four European sites share a common set of bacteria, algae (including cyanobacteria) lichens and bryophytes, first results indicate not only climate specific additions of species, but also genetic/phenotypic uniqueness of species between the four sites. While macroclimatic conditions are rather different, microclimatic conditions and partly soil properties seem fairly homogeneous between the four sites, with the exception of water availability. Continuous activity monitoring of photosystem II revealed the BSCs of the Spanish site as the least active in terms of photosynthetic active periods.

AB  - The Norwegian CLIMIT program for research, development and demonstration (RD&D) of carbon capture and storage (CCS) was established in 2005 to provide financial support to RD&D of CCS technologies. Research institutions and companies in Norway together with international partners may apply to CUM-IT for funding of their projects. The program is funded by the Norwegian government with an annual budget of (sic)24 million. CLIMIT has so far provided (sic)120 million to about 200 projects covering basic research, technology development and pilot scale demonstration projects. This paper presents a new strategy for the CLIMIT program, provides some background on CCS in Norway and a brief overview of Norwegian activities within CCS. The new CLIMIT strategy is based on seven foundation reports; 1) Technology status, 2) Market analysis, 3) Cost of CCS, 4) Policies and regulations, 5) International energy and CCS roadmaps, 6) Current infrastructure and test sites and 7) Innovative processes. Major findings from these reports are presented together with the resulting CLIMIT program strategy for 2012 - 2020. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Neighbourhood green space serves an important function for the urban population, and provides valuable ecosystem services for human well-being. In this article, we investigate the effects of naturalness, gender, and age on the activities, aesthetics, and self-reported well-being associated with urban green space. Our findings are based on a postal survey of residents living in close proximity to six different green spaces in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. It is shown that higher perceived naturalness generated more activities and higher aesthetic values and self-reported well-being for residents living close to urban green spaces. The results also indicated that, regardless of the type of naturalness, women were more active in urban green spaces than were men. Women also saw greater aesthetic value in green spaces than men did, and had higher self-reported well-being associated with the urban green spaces. Finally, older residents were shown to participate in a greater number of nature-related activities than younger residents. Older residents also saw greater aesthetic values and had higher self-reported well-being associated with urban green spaces than younger people did. Seemingly, this poses a considerable planning challenge if areas of perceived naturalness are to be retained in cities, since the present trend is for reduced green spaces in cities and a 'parkification' of surviving natural areas. Further, because of the importance of perceived natural areas to the elderly, and in particularly women, distances to urban green areas should not be too great. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Turf management on golf courses entails frequent maintenance activities, such as mowing, irrigation and fertilisation, and relies on purchased inputs for optimal performance and aesthetic quality. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, this study evaluated energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from management of two Swedish golf courses, divided into green, tee, fairway and rough, and identified options for improved management. Energy use and GHG emissions per unit area were highest for greens, followed by tees, fairways and roughs. However, when considering the entire golf course, both energy use and GHG emissions were mainly related to fairway and rough maintenance due to their larger area. Emissions of GHG for the two golf courses were 1.0 and 1.6 Mg CO2e ha 1 year 1 as an area-weighted average, while the energy use was 14 and 19 GJ ha(-1) year Mowing was the most energy-consuming activity, contributing 21 and 27% of the primary energy use for the two golf courses. In addition, irrigation and manufacturing of mineral fertiliser and machinery resulted in considerable energy use. Mowing and emissions associated with fertilisation (manufacturing of N fertiliser and soil emissions of N20 occurring after application) contributed most to GHG emissions. Including the estimated mean annual soil C sequestration rate for fairway and rough in the assessment considerably reduced the carbon footprint for fairway and turned the rough into a sink for GHG. Emissions of N20 from decomposition of grass clippings may be a potential hotspot for GHG emissions, but the high spatial and temporal variability of values reported in the literature makes it difficult to estimate these emissions for specific management regimes. Lowering the application rate of N mineral fertiliser, particularly on fairways, should be a high priority for golf courses trying to reduce their carbon footprint. However, measures must be adapted to the prevailing conditions at the specific golf course and the requirements set by golfers. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Ignoring the historic and cultural dimensions of landscapes makes environmental planning unsustainable, which in the long run, will have a negative impact on both the environment and society. This paper examines the work and perceptions of practitioners with a focus on the role of historic and cultural landscape dimensions and their relation to the recent implementation of the ecosystem service framework in sustainable environmental planning. Semi-structured interviews with officials at local and regional planning levels in a Swedish case study showed that the historical landscape forms the basis for environmental work. Respondents expressed an integrated view of the landscape, and historic and cultural landscape dimensions were considered important in the initial planning process. However, several challenges existed later in the planning process and final decision-making, such as conceptual ambiguities, unclear policy and assignments, limited cross-sectorial coordination and lack of awareness, knowledge, resources and other priorities. The results also show that the respondents worked regularly with intangible landscape dimensions, which can be defined as cultural ecosystem services, but they do not label them as such. Furthermore, established knowledge and expertise of heritage planning was not activated in the implementation of the ecosystem service approach. We conclude that historic and cultural landscape dimensions are not ignored in practice, but there is a need to articulate these aspects more clearly in order to achieve sustainable environmental planning. There is also an unexplored opportunity to connect skills and create new forms of cross-sectorial collaboration between heritage planning and the ES approach.

KW  - Household innovations
KW  - Comparing countries
AB  - An important aspect of any scientific approach to sustainability must be methods by which the impacts of possible innovations can be assessed. Clearly, we need to make massive changes in our lifestyles if we are to get anywhere near sustainability'. In this paper, an agent-based model' is developed which for this initial presentation explores probable impacts on household consumption and emissions of possible innovations. The model randomly picks a large number (here 10,000, but it can be much larger) of households from four different countries and calculates the effects resulting from the adoption of specific innovations. The lifestyle' of the households within the area studied is divided into four different domains'. These are living, food, mobility and energy. Innovations are launched in the four different domains and the model shows the overall effects on the total input requirements (materials, energy, etc.), the household and food wastes and the CO2 emissions, showing how far the system moves towards sustainability. By using the sustainability criteria of 8000kg input material' per year per individual developed by the Wuppertal Institute (Lettenmeier et al. in Resources 3:488-515, 2014, 10.3390/resources3030488, http://www.mdpi.com/journal/resources, ISSN 2079-9276), we can calculate how far the nation or region is from sustainability after adopting possible innovations. This is a measure of the total inputs required per individual per year. It allows us to show that for different countries, with widely different climates (e.g. Finland and Spain), different household innovations would have a greater or lesser impact on attaining sustainable lifestyles'. The model does not pretend to develop a full simulation of each system, including the ecosystem, type of economy, etc., but does look at the effect an innovation in one household domain will have on all four domains, thereby providing information that can improve current decisions. It also demonstrates that, although households' can do much to improve the situation by reducing their demand for energy and materials, some actions at a national/regional level will be required to achieve sustainability. For example, sustainability will require an end to the use of fossil fuels for transportation and a switch to clean' electrical power generation from renewables and nuclear sources. Without this change, these countries will find it impossible to reach a sustainable lifestyle.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are often defined by their dominant foundation tree species, which dictate forest structure and ecosystem processes. In southern Sweden, concerns are being raised because production stands of a foundation tree species, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), are being converted to Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Such conversions may lead to biodiversity loss, though the specific nature and extent of such losses remain unknown. Here, we assess the potential biodiversity impacts by contrasting the bird communities of 55- and 80-year-old Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. We also determine the extent to which these production stands capture the available species pool by surveying conifer-dominated reserves. Our results indicate that Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests support overlapping but nevertheless distinct bird communities, though only few recordings were made of the species unique to either stand type. Among the production stands, the 80-year spruce stands had the highest average bird species richness, and largest total number of species recorded. We suggest that the higher diversity can be explained by a higher proportion of broadleaves and higher volumes of dead wood. Although the bird diversity found in the reserves was lower than expected, they benefit gamma diversity at landscape scales as they collectively supported a higher diversity of bird species than the production forests. In summary, the conversion of Scots pine to Norway spruce is likely to increase the homogeneity of the bird communities in this region.

AB  - Changing land use from agriculture to forestry affects global carbon (C) balances. In addition to reduce using fossil fuels, climatic benefits may be reached by increasing forested areas where appropriate. At present, there is limited data concerning whether differences in C sequestration rates occur among tree species. In this study we evaluated the effects of various species on C sequestration at an early stage of afforestation. Total C stocks, i.e. C in biomass, litter and soil, were compiled for hybrid aspen, poplar, silver birch, Norway spruce, larch and willow. The species were planted in random blocks on five sites at different latitudes. Soil, litter and plant biomass were sampled repeatedly, except for root biomass which was calculated from functions found in the literature. There were no differences between species in total C stocks after 8-9 years growth, except for short rotation coppice (SRC) willows that reached a high production early due to a higher stand density compared to the species managed with short rotation forestry (SRF). Total C sequestration rates for sites varied from zero to 2.3-4.9 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). There were no effects of species on soil organic carbon (SOC), but significant decreases were noted for sites with high initial amounts, while SOC was unchanged or increased on sites with lower initial amounts. Mean SOC sequestration rates for sites ranged between -3.0 to 0.78 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Thus, former land use and time since abandonment rather than species seemed to influence the SOC pools at this early stage of afforestation. There were few differences between species in litter C in these young stands. We conclude that increased tree productivity had a positive effect on total C sequestration. It is crucial to include C in both biomass and soil when discussing C capture at land use change. The time factor is important and experiments like this should be followed for an extended time.

AB  - The need to assess the societal consequences of human actions impacting the environment has led to the concept of "ecosystem services" (ESS), which can be valued in socio-economic terms to communicate the ecologically-based costs and benefits of management choices. Quantifying the usually-neglected value of ESS should lead to better awareness of the societal importance of ecosystems and more balanced decision-making. We examine the case of the rehabilitation project of the River Pajakkajoki (Finland), aiming to improve conditions for fish spawning and increase the recreational attractiveness of natural areas along the river. We investigated how the rehabilitation changed ESS provision and the value of such change, focusing on recreational E55 due to data availability. We conducted an economic valuation of recreational [SS based on questionnaires administered to both locals and non-locals, analyzed by combining revealed and stated preference methods. We show that the rehabilitation generated great benefits: the estimated increase in recreational [SS value was 40D-144.7 /personlyear. with slight differences between residents and non-residents. When scaling up this value to all the visitors of the area, the benefits of river restoration were estimated to compensate for the project costs in approximately 3-10 years. justifying investments in restoration from a societal perspective.

AB  - The deadwood (DW) of the forest is in the following two forms: standing (snag) and fallen (log). The DW categories and decay stage are important functional and structural components of forest ecosystems. We used a field-based assessment to quantify how the relative contribution of deadwood to total above-ground carbon stock changes across a silvicultural method and stand altitude gradient in mixed broadleaves stands. The characteristics of DW and carbon stock in selection-cutting managed stands (Sc), shelter-wood managed stands (Sh) and protected stands (Pr) were examined in three altitude ranges (low, <600; medium, 600-1200; and high, >1200 m a.s.l.) in a mixed broadleaves high forest. The results showed that with increasing altitude, the volume of DW increased. The volume of DW in Pr stands was about three times higher than Sh stands and twice higher than Sc stands. The volume of the standing DW was greater than that of the fallen DW in all stands. The highest volume ratio of fallen DW to standing DW was found in the medium altitude in the Sc stand. The amount of carbon stock by DW in the Sh, Sc, and Pr stands was 1.53-2.22, 2.29-3.19, and 5.03-6.80 t ha(-1), respectively. The DW share of C-stock of above ground biomass was 4%-4.6% in Sh stand, 4.3%-4.8% in Sc stand, and 7.4%-7.9% in the Pr stand. Deadwood assessment and management, in terms of volume, type, species composition, diameter distribution, spatial allocation and decay stage, is one of the new challenges for a proper sustainable forest management.

AB  - The kelp Saccharina latissima is a species of high ecological and economic importance. We developed a novel set of S. latissima-specific genetic markers that will find applications in conservation biology, biodiversity assessment, and commercial exploitation of this macroalga. Thirty-two expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived microsatellite markers (SSRs) were developed and characterized in this study using publically available EST sequences. Twenty-seven percent of the 7064 analyzed ESTs contained repeat motifs, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification primers were designed for 96 selected loci. Fifty-one (53 %) of the primer pairs amplified their target loci, of which 32 (33 %) were polymorphic within a sample of 96 S. latissima sporophytes collected from six localities distributed along the European Atlantic coast from Southern Brittany (France) to Spitzbergen (Norway). The 32 loci harbored moderate levels of polymorphism with 2-13 alleles per locus (mean 5.4). The 25 loci that were retained for population genetic analyses revealed substantial genetic differentiation among the European populations (pairwise F (ST) values ranging from 0.077 to 0.562) that did not follow any pattern of isolation by distance. In addition, within-population genetic diversity was generally low (Hs < 0.323). Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were proposed to explain this low diversity pattern: (1) lower variability of the EST-derived microsatellites compared to the random distribution of SSRs developed from genomic DNA since the former are frequently located in coding regions, which are generally less variable, or (2) reduced effective population size of S. latissima. The particularly high genetic differentiation between the French and Scandinavian S. latissima populations is in agreement with the reported ecotypic differentiation, which may reflect an important resource for genetic improvement. The pattern of genetic diversity revealed in this study thus suggests that care should be taken to avoid the transfer of strains between different geographic regions.

AB  - Frozen soil is predicted to change in the boreal areas with climate warming. We studied growth, longevity and mortality of fine roots at different levels of frozen soil in winter followed by a delayed soil thawing in spring in a 47-year-old stand of Picea abies (L. Karst.) in the boreal zone. The treatments, repeated over two winters, were: (i) natural insulating snow accumulation and melting (CTRL), (ii) snow removed during winter (OPEN), and (iii) as OPEN in winter but soil thaw delayed by insulation at the top of the forest floor (FROST). Short and long roots were monitored at different depths by minirhizotron imaging at one-month intervals from May to October in the 2 years during and 2 years after the treatments, to assess standing length (SSL), production volume (SPV) and mortality. A survival function estimate was calculated according to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate for interval censored data, and the mean and median root longevities were calculated as with a Kaplan-Meier estimate. CTRL and OPEN did not differ for SSL and SPV but they differed in FROST where compensatory growth occurred in the follow-up seasons. The mean longevity ranged from 276 to 305 days for short roots and from 425 to 464 days for long roots, being higher in OPEN than CTRL and FROST, and higher in the deeper soil layers than near the soil surface. The mean and median longevities were largely the same for short roots but the means were 80-100 days higher for long roots. We conclude that the winters with deep soil freezing are not detrimental for fine roots of Norway spruce, insofar as soil thawing will not prolong the growing season. The longer lifetime in OPEN suggests declining carbon flux into the soil following winters with deeply frozen soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern forestry practices are based on the idea of 'big is beautiful'. Especially in the regeneration phase, the operations are often excessive in relation to the profit that one can expect to gain in decades to come. Excessive operations also constrain the use of ecosystem services. Lean forestry is a novel philosophy of forestry practise that aims to direct the idea of "big is beautiful" in modern silviculture more into "do cost effectively only what is needed to fulfil the goals". To succeed Lean forestry requires exact spatial information to be able to carry out forestry measures very precisely only where they are really needed to fulfil goals. This kind of a paradigm shift requires systems with new kinds of abilities to remotely sense the surrounding environment and to make better and faster decisions based on sensed data. Automated unmanned offroad vehicle that is able to sense the environment and to make lean decisions is presented as an example of initiatives that can make forestry more cost-effective and simultaneously improve utilisation of wide range of ecosystem services in forests.

AB  - Reducing the undesirable outcomes of wind power (WP) in the vicinity of homes with forest management practices can increase the acceptance of WP. If forest owners would avoid clear felling and use light forest management close to homes towards wind turbines, residents might be interested in paying for such a 'landscape shield' in the payment for ecosystem services (PES) context. The majority (83.7%) of the survey sample from Finland were interested in participating in the PES mechanism. On average, they were willing to pay euro80.9 per hectare annually to participate in landscape value trade arranging a landscape shield against wind turbines. We applied the attitude-behavior framework to understand the factors and structures underlying residents' willingness to pay (WTP). The analysis emphasized the importance of intentions, attitudes, and subjective norms over socio-demographic variables in explaining WTP. WTP and the intention to contribute to the cost of the landscape shield were determined by the intention to discuss landscape protection with forest owners and further by the attitudes towards the landscape shield and the interest of neighbors it. This result strongly emphasizes the importance of communication, both with the providers and other consumers of the service.

AB  - The aim was to investigate the relationships between landscape-related personal and collective identity and well-being of residents living in a Swedish mountain county (N = 850). It was shown that their most valued mountain activities were viewing and experiencing nature and landscape, outdoor recreation, rest and leisure, and socializing with friends/family. Qualitative analyses showed that the most valued aspects of the sites were landscape and outdoor restoration for personal favorite sites, and tourism and alpine for collective favorite sites. According to quantitative analyses the stronger the attachment/closeness/belonging (emotional component of place identity) residents felt to favorite personal and collective sites the more well-being they perceived when visiting these places. Similarly, the more remembrance, thinking and mental travel (cognitive component of place identity) residents directed to these sites the more well-being they perceived in these places. In both types of sites well-being was more strongly predicted by emotional than cognitive component of place-identity. All this indicates the importance of person-place bonds in beneficial experiences of the outdoors, over and above simply being in outdoor environments.

AB  - Reindeer herding is a nature-based livelihood of the indigenous Sami people in northern parts of Europe and Russia. During the last decades, reindeer herding has become a more significant issue in the context of the market economy: the livelihood has transformed toward entrepreneurship, and the subsidies demand growth in the scale of herding. According to the national administration, the market values are highlighted. However, for herders, market economies are only one part of their livelihood. Another important part is their experience of reindeer herding as a way of life; for many reindeer herders trust in their livelihood and the social relations associated with their way of life are of equal or greater importance than economic aspects. In this paper, the role of social trust in the changing process of reindeer herding is discussed. Inherited tacit and cultural knowledge, as a part of social capital, strengthen reindeer herders' experience of trust.

AB  - In the current context of urban densification and climate change the role of adaptive management of space in cities becomes crucial. This has significant consequences for the resilience of urban environments, and our understanding and framing the role of open space and vegetation in cities. Urban ecosystem services (ES) are currently promoted in Sweden in the planning for more dense and sustainable cities. Despite the vital importance of ES, the methodology for planning of ES has not been developed. Of particular concern to scientists, environmentalists and planners are tools and methods addressing ES in urban planning and construction in Stockholm. Thus, the findings are particularly interesting as Stockholm cfiy and region are often used as the best practice examples in the Ifierature on the management of ES. This article identifies some of the challenges and opportunities in Stockholm involved in the process of integrating the concept of ES into planning for urban resilience.

AB  - This article provides an historical analysis of arguments for and against using forests for fuel since the 1970s energy crises, and explores the relationship between public narratives and the implementation of renewable energy technologies. I argue that different ideas about the use of forest resources created narrative conflict between stakeholder groups, and this conflict influenced the development of biomass energy systems by limiting private investment and shaping public policy. Promoters and opponents of forest fuels both worked to achieve political goals as well as economic and environmental ones, and debates about biomass energy reflected these different views. Although this paper focuses on public perceptions about wood energy in the US, biomass advocacy in the US was influenced by efforts in other countries, particularly by innovation in Sweden and Finland. By providing an historical investigation of the cultural barriers to developing decentralized renewable energy systems in the US, and explaining how this experience compared with biomass development in other countries, this research demonstrates how conflicting narratives have shaped energy and environmental policy since the 1970s. This historical perspective contains valuable lessons about how different social groups' values and beliefs have affected - and continue to affect - decisions about new energy technologies.

AB  - The overall impact of individual environmental factors on the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) is well known, but the simultaneous impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on the amount and diversity of SOC pools in mountain areas are still insufficiently recognized. This study has three objectives: (1) to determine SOC pools in the mountain toposequence in relation to the climate-elevation gradient and vertical vegetation zonality, largely as a result of interference caused by human activity; (2) to predict the fluctuations of SOC pools in mountain soils affected by changes in land use/forest management and expected climate warming; and (3) to verify whether the humus form is a predictor of SOC pools in mountain soil. A spatial, climate-/altitude-dependent trend of SOC pools is clearly marked on the northern slopes of the Karkonosze Mountains, SW Poland. These SOC pools gradually increase up to the altitude of ca. 1000 m a.s.l. and then decrease in the uppermost forest and subalpine zones. The SOC pools are also strongly related to land use/vegetation (arable soils < grasslands = European beech stands < Norway spruce stands) and soil type (Luvisols < Cambisols < Podzols). Humus forms reflect the differences in SOC pools (mull < moder < mor), but the recent European classification does not clearly allocate semiterrestrial sub-types among mor and moder humus forms. Expected climate warming and present changes in land use and forest management lead to similar changes in SOC pools. However, replacing spruce monocultures with mixed or broadleaf stands reduces the SOC pools in the lower forest zones, while the timberline rise and the succession of Norway spruce on grasslands increases SOC pools in the upper forest and subalpine zones. Thus, the balance of SOC pools caused by changes in land use and climate warming will be specific in particular mountain areas, depending on their maximum altitude and existing vegetation zones, the degree of anthropogenic transformation of ecosystems, and the resilience of ecosystems to climate changes. It is expected that the SOC pools in the Karkonosze Mts and similar medium-elevation mountain ranges of Central Europe will decrease due to the larger scale of phenomena which decrease SOC pools.

AB  - We analyze the potential for socioeconomically sustainable peatland use by investigating conflicting interests, revealing trade-offs that people are willing to accept, and studying whether opinions are dependent on socioeconomic and demographic factors. Opinions toward five forms of peatland use and seven peatland ecosystem services were surveyed in Northern Ostrobothnia in northern Finland in 2011. Choice experiment (CE) was used to reveal trade-offs in land use preferences, and groups of respondents were identified using the latent class model (LCM). We identified three classes of respondents in which environmentalists showed a high preference toward the cessation of peat production and increase of peatland restoration, the production-oriented class preferred an increase in timber and peat production areas, and the current use supporters agreed on the present land use policy. However, all respondent classes agreed on the increase of nature protection and the present level of timber production and disagreed on the cessation of restoration. The CE revealed that environmentally minded people who are likely to consider the indirect use values and existence values important are less willing to make trade-offs between ecosystem services than those who emphasize direct use values. Because peatland restoration occurs in commercially unproductive peatlands, it improves both the direct use and existence values without reducing provisioning services of peatlands. Therefore, restoration is commonly accepted by the public, in contrast to management options that involve clear trade-offs between ecosystem services. We conclude that the understanding of preferences and trade-offs can enhance sustainable land use planning. It may be unrealistic, however, to expect a solution that all interest groups would completely accept.

KW  - TREE
AB  - The practice of collecting wild plants, fungi, and other materials occurs in urban and peri-urban communities around the world, across various socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural groups, providing sustenance, medicine, materials, social cohesion, and an increased sense of connectedness with nature. Invasive plants, many of which were introduced and cultivated purposefully in the past, can be foraged to generate socioeconomic and cultural value for communities while simultaneously facilitating ecosystem services. I will profile several invasive plants common to New York City (NYC), purposefully introduced in the 18th-19th centuries, including Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), Norway maple (Acer platanoides), and white mulberry (Morus alba), providing an overview of the plants' cultivation history, socioeconomic value, and ecological threat. Partnerships between foraging communities and greenspace managers offer potential opportunities to support invasive species management in urban ecosystems. The goal of this article is to help shift the knowledge and management strategies around non-native plants in urban environments, so that their potential socioeconomic value and provisioning services received through urban foraging are accounted for in urban ecosystem management approaches.

AB  - This study develops an approach to mapping indicators of the potential of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services, and the impact of changes in land cover and use upon them. The study focuses on the EU-25 plus Switzerland and Norway, and develops the methodology proposed by Kienast et al. (2009), which uses expert-and literature-driven modelling methods. The methods are explored in relation to mapping and assessing four of the ecosystem services: "Crop-based production"; "Wildlife products"; "Habitat diversity"; and "Recreation". The potential to deliver services is assumed to be influenced by (a) land-use, (b) net primary production, and (c) bioclimatic and landscape properties such as mountainous terrain, adjacency to coastal and wetland ecosystems, as well as adjacency to landscape and nature protection zones.
   The novel aspect of this work is an analysis of whether the historical and the projected land use changes for the periods 1990-2000,2000-2006, and 2000-2030 are likely to be supportive or degenerative in the capacity of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services; we refer to these as 'marginal' or incremental changes. The latter are assessed by using land account data for 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 (LEAC, EEA, 2006) and EURURALIS 2.0 land use scenarios for 2000-2030. The results are reported at three spatial reporting units, i.e. (1) the NUTS-X regions, (2) the bioclimatic regions, and (3) the dominant landscape types. All mapped output has been compared with independently generated continent-wide assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental parameters/indicators), which revealed that the straightforward binary links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns. This conclusion mainly holds for provisioning services. At the continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies which can be used to assess the medium-term potential of landscapes to provide ecosystem services.
   For a subset of NUTS-x regions for which change trajectories for 1990-2000,2000-2006 and 2000-2030 are available, trade-offs between the four services have been analyzed using cluster analyses. The latter allowed us to simultaneously analyze the state of the four services in year 2000 and the individual trajectories of each service over three time periods. As a result we obtained seven regions with distinct trade-off patterns. To our knowledge this is one of the first continental-wide analyses where and use trajectories are taken into account to construct an indicator to estimate the balance between a set or bundle of ecosystem services. The relationship between the outputs of this work and the development of rapid assessment and accounting frameworks is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In a world of accelerating changes in environmental conditions driving tree growth, tradeoffs between tree growth rate and longevity could curtail the abundance of large old trees (LOTs), with potentially dire consequences for biodiversity and carbon storage. However, the influence of tree-level tradeoffs on forest structure at landscape scales will also depend on disturbances, which shape tree size and age distribution, and on whether LOTs can benefit from improved growing conditions due to climate warming. We analyzed temporal and spatial variation in radial growth patterns from similar to 5000 Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] H. Karst) live and dead trees from the Western Carpathian primary spruce forest stands. We applied mixed-linear modeling to quantify the importance of LOT growth histories and stand dynamics (i.e., competition and disturbance factors) on lifespan. Finally, we assessed regional synchronization in radial growth variability over the 20th century, and modeled the effects of stand dynamics and climate on LOTs recent growth trends. Tree age varied considerably among forest stands, implying an important role of disturbance as an age constraint. Slow juvenile growth and longer period of suppressed growth prolonged tree lifespan, while increasing disturbance severity and shorter time since last disturbance decreased it. The highest age was not achieved only by trees with continuous slow growth, but those with slow juvenile growth followed by subsequent growth releases. Growth trend analysis demonstrated an increase in absolute growth rates in response to climate warming, with late summer temperatures driving the recent growth trend. Contrary to our expectation that LOTs would eventually exhibit declining growth rates, the oldest LOTs (>400 years) continuously increase growth throughout their lives, indicating a high phenotypic plasticity of LOTs for increasing biomass, and a strong carbon sink role of primary spruce forests under rising temperatures, intensifying droughts, and increasing bark beetle outbreaks.

AB  - This article focuses on changes in the use of fish resources and its interrelationships with societal and natural transformations in the Baltic Sea setting within the last 100 years. The study area, the Finnish Archipelago Sea Region, consists of unique coastal landscape with shallow water areas between thousands of islands and islets. Fishing income was traditionally combined with shipping and small-scale agriculture, but today fishing families' income combinations are more diverse. The fishing livelihood in the archipelago is typically seasonal operation and targets several fish species with e.g. gill nets.
   Extraction of fish resources has been of utmost economic and cultural importance in the Archipelago Sea Region: fisheries contributed to habitation of outer parts of the region at the turn of the 20th century. In mid 20th century fishing started to lose its profitability and many islands became desolated. Decline in the fishing employment was due, for instance, to technical development, urbanization and industrialization of the society. In the 1970s a new innovation, fish farming in net cages, compensated for the decline of capture fisheries. At the same time the production landscape of fishing peasants began its change towards one of leisure and nature conservation. This post-productivist transformation contained not only an increase in the competition of space, but also a remarkable change in people's perceptions and values about the use and governance of fish resources. This analysis is based on a wide collection of published articles, books and documents, together with unpublished interview material illuminating the most recent transformations.

AB  - Large carnivores can be a key factor in shaping their ungulate prey's behavior, which may affect lower trophic levels. While most studies on trade-offs between food acquisition and risk avoidance by ungulate prey species have been conducted in areas with limited human impact, carnivores are now increasingly returning to highly anthropogenic landscapes. Many of these landscapes are dominated by forestry, and ungulate-forestry conflicts are an increasing issue. The aim of this study was to test if the indirect effects of a re-colonizing large predator, the wolf Canis lupus, results in a change in browsing intensity by moose Alces alces in young forest plantations in a boreal forest in Sweden. We selected 24 different forest plantations, with 12 located in low-wolf and 12 in high-wolf utilization areas. In each plantation, we measured browsing intensity, tree height, tree density, distance to the closest forest edge and we counted the number of moose pellet groups. In contrast to our predictions, wolf utilization was not the main driver of moose browsing patterns. Instead, moose browsing intensity declined with tree density and height. Separate analyses on the main tree species showed that wolf utilization had an influence, but browsing intensity was in fact higher in the high-wolf utilization areas for three out of five tree species. This pattern seemed to be driven by a strong confounding relationship between wolf utilization, tree density and height, which were both lower in the high-wolf utilization areas. We argue that this confounding effect is due to wolves being pushed towards the less productive parts of the landscape away from human activity centers. Therefore, we concluded that in order to better understand carnivore driven risk-mediated effects on herbivore behavior in anthropogenic landscapes we need to better understand the complexity of human-carnivore-prey-ecosystem interactions.

AB  - Some of the best wind and natural gas resources in Norway are located in rural areas. Hydrogen can be produced from natural gas in combination with carbon capture and storage to utilize the natural gas resources without significant CO2-emissions. The hydrogen can be liquefied and transported to regions with energy deficits. This creates a demand for hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water, which facilitates wind power development without requiring large investments in new transmission capacity. A regional optimization model is developed and used to investigate sizing of the electrolyser capacity and hydrogen storage, as well as regional effects of producing hydrogen from electrolysis. In the model, the transmission grid is represented by dc power flow equations and opportunities for wind power investments in the region are included.
   The model is used in a case study which shows that hydrogen storage contributes to significantly increase grid utilization, even with small amounts of storage. Increased regional transmission capacity results in more wind power development compared to increased capacity towards the central grid. Hydrogen storage is only profitable to reduce congestion in this deterministic model, thus using hydrogen storage to reduce the costs in the spot market is not profitable.

AB  - Citizen science can facilitate in-depth learning for pupils and students, contribute to scientific research, and permit civic participation. Here, we describe the development of the transnational school-based citizen science project Phenology of the North Calotte. Its primary goal is to introduce pupils (age 12-15; grades 7-10) in northern Norway, Russia, and Finland to the local and global challenges of climate change resulting in life cycle changes at different trophic and ecosystem levels in their backyards. Partnerships between regional scientists and staff from NIBIO Svanhovd, State nature reserves, national parks, and teachers and pupils from regional schools aim to engage pupils in project-based learning. The project uses standardized protocols, translated into the different languages of participating schools. The phenological observations are centered around documenting clearly defined life cycle phases (e.g., first appearance of species, flowering, ripening, leaf yellowing, snow fall, and melt). The observations are collected either on paper and are subsequently submitted manually to an open-source online database or submitted directly via a newly developed mobile app. In the long term, the database is anticipated to contribute to research studying changes in phenology at different trophic levels. In principle, guided school-based citizen science projects have the potential to contribute to increased environmental awareness and education and thereby to transformative learning at the societal level while contributing to scientific progress of understudied biomes, like the northern taiga and (sub)arctic tundra. However, differences in school systems and funding insecurity for some schools have been major prohibiting factors for long-term retention of pupils/schools in the program. Project-based and multidisciplinary learning, although pedagogically desired, has been partially difficult to implement in participating schools, pointing to the need of structural changes in national school curricula and funding schemes as well as continuous offers for training and networking for teachers.

AB  - This study addresses a response to shifting baseline syndrome (SBS), a syndrome implying that land managers' acceptance of environmental change declines gradually due to lack of historical knowledge. Some actions to counteract SBS are haunted by methodological problems associated with measuring natural states and ignoring societal effects on ideas of naturalness. To balance methodological discussions of SBS, this study analyzes the social contexts of baseline demarcations historically. It compares baselines in two Swedish forest conservation debates-about the Fiby forest in the 1930s and the Ojnare forest in the 2010s-focusing on scalable and unscalable values. To operationalize shifting societal criteria for baseline demarcations, we introduce the "shifting society syndrome" concept. The study identifies several societal shifts and shows that Fiby's baseline was shaped by the scalable value of age and the nonscalable values of uniqueness and Swedishness, and Ojnare's by the scalable value of biodiversity and the nonscalable values of uniqueness and wildness. We argue that values, scalability, and historical change are crucial variables in the practice of demarcating baselines and that intellectual history is a useful tool for methodological self-reflection in SBS research.

AB  - Floral resource quantity in agricultural landscapes plays a key role in the persistence of wild pollinators. An equally important, but less investigated factor is how variation in floral resource availability over time, e.g. floral resource pulses, affects pollinator abundances and diversity. Despite the potential importance of late-season resource pulses for bumblebee reproduction, few studies have evaluated the effects of late-season mass-flowering crops on bumblebee abundances and diversity during and after crop bloom. We assessed how bumblebee abundances, diversity and traits associated with species rarity were affected by cultivation of late-season mass-flowering red clover grown for seed production. Bumblebees were surveyed in red clover fields and flower-rich field borders across 20 landscapes with or without a red clover field during and after crop bloom in southern Sweden. Bumblebee worker abundances were higher in clover fields compared to flower-rich borders in the surrounding landscape. There was no relationship between presence of clover fields and the abundance of males of social bumblebees, but more male cuckoo bumblebees were found in flower-rich borders in landscapes with clover following crop bloom. Mass-flowering red clover also had a positive effect on bumblebee species richness and diversity after crop bloom. Overall, clover had positive and lasting effects on less common bumblebees thereby sustaining higher bumblebee species richness after bloom. Cultivation of red clover has the potential, in combination with the management of flower-rich habitats, to benefit less common bumblebee species in temperate agroecosystems.

AB  - Recently, increased attention has been drawn to the greenhouse gas emissions of the Land use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. In the Finnish LULUCF sector, the soil-originated emissions from the after-use of cutover peatland have become a more relevant question. This is due to the rapid increase in the number of former peat-harvesting sites, caused by the decline in the combustion of energy peat due to its high CO2 emissions. We conducted a nationally representative survey to study which after-use options of cutover peatlands are preferred by landowners. Based on the preferred after-use options, we estimated their impact on the national greenhouse gas emissions in the Finnish regions in 2035, and what factors influence the landowners' choice of after-use options. We found that the four most popular after-use options for landowners were afforestation (71%), agriculture (24%), production of wind and solar power (22%) and rewetting (18%) when the respondent chose the three most attractive options. However, there were clear regional differences in the preferred after-use options, which might lead, if realized, to different soil-originated emissions at the regional level. The preferred after-use options could produce emissions of 0.35 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year (Mt CO2 eq y-1) by 2035 in Finland. Most of these emissions (30.1%) would come from South Ostrobothnia in western Finland, mainly due to the indicated high interest in agricultural after-use. Most landowners prefer financially profitable after-use options, such as forestry, agriculture, as well as wind and solar energy production in cutover peatlands. However, environmentally oriented landowners favour many kinds of actions to support biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and water protection in cutover peatlands. It is crucial that economic productivity and the greenhouse gas sinks of cutover peatlands be considered simultaneously to meet the climate targets of the LULUCF sector in Finland.

AB  - Species richness is predicted to increase in the northern latitudes in the warming climate due to ranges of many southern species expanding northwards. We studied changes in the composition of the whole avifauna and in bird species richness in a period of already warming climate in Finland (in northern Europe) covering 1,100km in south-north gradient across the boreal zone (over 300,000km(2)). We compared bird species richness and species-specific changes (for all 235 bird species that occur in Finland) in range size (number of squares occupied) and range shifts (measured as median of area of occupancy) based on bird atlas studies between 1974-1989 and 2006-2010. In addition, we tested how the habitat preference and migration strategy of species explain species-specific variation in the change of the range size. The study was carried out in 10km squares with similar research intensity in both time periods. The species richness did not change significantly between the two time periods. The composition of the bird fauna, however, changed considerably with 37.0% of species showing an increase and 34.9% a decrease in the numbers of occupied squares, that is, about equal number of species gained and lost their range. Altogether 95.7% of all species (225/235) showed changes either in the numbers of occupied squares or they experienced a range shift (or both). The range size of archipelago birds increased and long-distance migrants declined significantly. Range loss observed in long-distance migrants is in line with the observed population declines of long-distance migrants in the whole Europe. The results show that there is an ongoing considerable species turnover due to climate change and due to land use and other direct human influence. High bird species turnover observed in northern Europe may also affect the functional diversity of species communities.

AB  - This paper applies the concept of cultural ecosystem services (CES) to reveal the diverse benefits the Baltic Sea provides to human well-being. The study identifies and defines relevant CES for marine and coastal environments and applies them in a survey with 4800 respondents from Germany, Finland and Latvia. The relative importance of various CES was determined by asking respondents to allocate 100 points between CES related to recreation, landscape, inspiration, learning and education, spiritual experiences and belonging, historically and culturally important places and the existence of habitats. The results reveal significant differences in the importance of various CES across countries, users and nonusers of the Baltic Sea, as well as respondents with different human-nature relationships. The results emphasize the importance of considering recreation, landscapes and habitats in conservation policies, while acknowledging that all CES are perceived as important by some population groups.

AB  - This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks.
   Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged.
   Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.

AB  - To understand the global carbon cycle and the impact of human activity on climate, it is necessary to quantify the net CO2 exchange of ecosystems in different land uses on a large scale. Methods to estimate soil net CO2 exchange (NECO2soil) for drained peatland forests have been largely based on chamber measurements and statistical models. The uncertainty in these methods has not been assessed. Yet, disturbed organic soils are a globally important, potential CO2 source due to their vast carbon storage and its sensitivity to changes in soil moisture.
   In this study, we estimated the countrywide NECO2soil for the 4.76 million ha of forestry-drained peat soils in Finland. We gathered available litter production and CO2 efflux data and constructed models to be used for the upscaling of NECO2soil from forest inventory data. The contribution of each model and the inventory sampling to the precision of the countrywide estimate was calculated. Also, the sensitivity to possible bias in selected model components was estimated.
   Compared to the estimated mean NECO2soil, ranging from a source of +20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C to a sink of -40 g m(-2) year(-1) of C, the uncertainty was high. The precision of the estimate (+/- 1 standard deviation) was +/- 20 g m(-2) year(-1) of C. Due to possible bias in the estimated belowground litter input, the overall uncertainty was much higher, around 60 g m(-2) year(-1) of C.
   The main reason for the high relative uncertainty was NECO2soil being on average close to zero in these boreal forestry-drained peatlands. Forest inventory sample size was large enough and the data for the models were mainly sufficient. To reduce the uncertainty, better understanding of belowground carbon fluxes in order to accurately determine the C input to soil, is crucial. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid growth of the salmon industry necessitates the development of fast and accurate tools to assess its environmental impact. Macrobenthic monitoring is commonly used to measure the impact of organic enrichment associated with salmon farm activities. However, classical benthic monitoring can hardly answer the rapidly growing demand because the morphological identification of macro-invertebrates is time-consuming, expensive and requires taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of meiofauna-sized organisms, such as Foraminifera, was proposed to overcome the drawbacks of macrofauna-based benthic monitoring. Here, we tested the application of foraminiferal metabarcoding to benthic monitoring of salmon farms in Norway. We analysed 140 samples of eDNA and environmental RNA (eRNA) extracted from surface sediment samples collected at 4 salmon farming sites in Norway. We sequenced the variable region 37f of the 18S rRNA gene specific to Foraminifera. We compared our data to the results of macrofaunal surveys of the same sites and tested the congruence between various diversity indices inferred from metabarcoding and morphological data. The results of our study confirm the usefulness of Foraminifera as bioindicators of organic enrichment associated with salmon farming. The foraminiferal diversity increased with the distance to fish cages, and metabarcoding provides an assessment of the ecological quality comparable to the morphological analyses. The foraminiferal metabarcoding approach appears to be a promising alternative to classical benthic monitoring, providing a solution to the morpho-taxonomic bottleneck of macrofaunal surveys.

AB  - Questions: Is it possible to render the species pool concept operational for cultural landscape management and restoration?
   Location: Hordaland and Sogn & Fjordane counties, western Norway.
   Methods: An initial regional species list, based on information on the distribution of species and habitats in the Norwegian flora. was filtered using information on target communities and species lists from 95 sites in the region. Owing to the importance of both mowing and grazing Ellenberg indicator values were not used in the identification process.
   Results: The final regional species pool consisted of 227 species, of which 194 were extracted from the flora, while 33 agricultural landscape species were added from the actual pool or from a list of species in additional hay meadows. Some of the 33 species were regular inhabitants of hay meadows, others were rare in the region. The regional species pool list includes information on each species on demands when hydrology, nutrients and base saturation in the soil is concerned, and whether or not they are characteristic for either of the boreal or boreo-nemoral vegetation zones.
   Conclusions: Specialist knowledge was an advantage when adding cultural landscape species other than meadow species of the flora; 77 species were documented only by the flora, interesting from the point of view of restoration as this part of the pool would not have been found by just adding species lists. The diversity of the now isolated hay meadow sites in the region may be kept up by replacing the lost natural invasion by an artificial one, using local seed mixtures and transplants.

AB  - Ongoing and previous range expansions have a strong influence on population genetic structure of plants. In turn, genetic variation in the new range may affect the population dynamics and the expansion process. The annual Ceratocapnos claviculata (Papaveraceae) has expanded its Atlantic European range in recent decades towards the north and east. Patterns of genetic diversity were investigated across the native range to assess current population structure and phylogeographical patterns. A test was then made as to whether genetic diversity is reduced in the neophytic range and an attempt was made to identify source regions of the expansion.
   Samples were taken from 55 populations in the native and 34 populations in the neophytic range (Sweden, north-east Germany). Using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers an analysis was made of genetic variation and population structure (Bayesian statistical modelling) and population differentiation was quantified. Pollen/ovule ratio was analysed as a proxy for the breeding system.
   Genetic diversity at population level was very low (mean H-e 0004) and two multilocus genotypes dominated large parts of the new range. Population differentiation was strong (F-ST 0812). These results and a low pollen/ovule ratio are consistent with an autogamous breeding system. Genetic variation decreased from the native to the neophytic range. Within the native range, H-e decreased towards the north-east, whereas population size increased. According to the Bayesian cluster analysis, the putative source regions of the neophytic range are situated in north-west Germany and adjacent regions.
   Ceratocapnos claviculata shows a cline of genetic variation due to postglacial recolonization from putative Pleistocene refugia in south-west Europe. Nevertheless, the species has expanded successfully during the past 40 years to southern Sweden and north-east Germany where it occurs as an opportunistic neophyte. Recent expansion was mainly human-mediated by single long-distance diaspore transport and was facilitated by habitat modification.

AB  - Questions Peatland ecosystems are a globally important carbon storage that is predicted to turn into a carbon source due to water level drawdown (WLD) associated with climate change. The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of 10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.

AB  - We studied the impact of simulated global change on a high alpine meadow plant community. Specifically, we examined whether short-term (5 years) responses are good predictors for medium-term (7 years) changes in the system by applying a factorial warming and nutrient manipulation to 20 plots in Latnjajaure, subarctic Sweden. Seven years of experimental warming and nutrient enhancement caused dramatic shifts in dominance hierarchies in response to the nutrient and the combined warming and nutrient enhancement treatments. Dominance hierarchies in the meadow moved from a community being dominated by cushion plants, deciduous, and evergreen shrubs to a community being dominated by grasses, sedges, and forbs. Short-termresponses were shown to be inconsistent in their ability to predict medium-term responses for most functional groups, however, grasses showed a consistent and very substantial increase in response to nutrient addition over the seven years. The non-linear responses over time point out the importance of longer-term studies with repeated measurements to be able to better predict future changes. Forecasted changes to temperature and nutrient availability have implications for trophic interactions, and may ultimately influence the access to and palatability of the forage for grazers. Depending on what anthropogenic change will be most pronounced in the future (increase in nutrient deposits, warming, or a combination of them both), different shifts in community dominance hierarchies may occur. Generally, this study supports the productivity-diversity relationship found across arctic habitats, with community diversity peaking in mid-productivity systems and degrading as nutrient availability increases further. This is likely due the increasing competition in plant-plant interactions and the shifting dominance structure with grasses taking over the experimental plots, suggesting that global change could have high costs to biodiversity in the Arctic.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a concept to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of energy production from fossil fuels. In oxy-fuel combustion, the fuel is burned in a mixture of oxygen and recycled flue gas. This generates CO2-rich flue gas from which the CO2 is easily separated and compressed. Foster Wheeler Power Group is developing the existing design tools and process models of air-fired circulating fluidized bed boilers to implement specific features of oxycombustion. The validation data is produced from bench-scale and pilot-scale experiments at the VTT, Technical Research Centre of Finland. A three-dimensional circulating fluidized bed (CFB) furnace model is developed and applied by Lappeenranta University of Technology for predicting the effects of oxycombustion in full scale units. This paper presents concept Studies and initial 3D modeling results based on a 460 MW, supercritical CFB power plant at Lagisza, and pilot-scale studies with flue gas recirculation demonstrating real oxygen combustion conditions.

AB  - Estimation of carbon stocks in forests and tracking their dynamics over time requires repeated and spatially dense observations. Sweden is one of the major forested countries on Earth with a carbon pool of approximately 1 PgC. Statistics on forest resources are regularly quantified by data collected at field inventory plots by the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). Nonetheless, the sampling by the inventory does not provide detailed spatial knowledge of carbon stored in forests. Thanks to one of the worldwide densest datasets of L-band satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected over the years, we assessed the estimation of carbon density on two years, i.e., 2010 and 2015, at pixel (25 m), landscape, county and national level, and investigated the reliability of changes over five years. While the maps of carbon density were obtained with a well-established approach, the uncertainty of the estimates were obtained with a novel procedure that accounted for observational variances and co-variances. The high spatial resolution of the maps revealed the small-scale patterns of carbon density in Swedish forests. However, the substantial uncertainties at the pixel level (25%-62% of the estimated value) prevented from a reliable estimate of carbon density difference at the pixel level. Average values at landscape and county scale were instead unbiased and in strong agreement with corresponding numbers from the Swedish NFI. The uncertainty at county level was between 3% and 12% of the reference mean value. Overall, the net carbon balance for Sweden was positive, with a magnitude comparable to estimates derived from data collected by the NFI. Between 2010 and 2015, Swedish forests acted as a carbon sink, with a net increase of carbon stocks by 2.5%. The high level of confidence in our results indicate that satellite L-band observations are potentially suitable for tracking large-scale forest carbon dynamics in boreal forests provided that multiple observations are available per year and that they are acquired with the same viewing geometry.

AB  - Management of natural resources at the regional level is a compromise between a variety of objectives and interests. At the local level, management of the forests depends upon the ownership structure, with forest owners using their forests as they see fit. A potential conflict occurs if the forest owners' management decisions are counter to the interests of society in general or the industry that relies on the forest resource as their raw material. We explore the intensity of this conflict at the regional level in several large boreal forest production landscapes. To explore the conflict, we investigate three main interest groups: (i) economically oriented forest owners; (ii) industry groups (focusing on maintaining an even timber supply); and (iii) a group representing general public interests (focusing on enhancing ecosystem services and biodiversity protection). The severity of conflicts differs between interest groups; we found a minor conflict between the economically oriented forest owners and industry and a severe conflict among general public interests and the other groups. By quantifying the conflicts, visualizing the impacts shared among interest groups, we anticipate that through shared discovery and understanding, forests can be managed to lessen the conflicts between interest groups.

In Finland, brook-side spruce forests constitute the most important key-habitat type in terms of total area and timber volume. Our aim was to compare polypore diversity and the occurrence of red-listed species between brook-side key habitats and comparable sites of managed forest as controls. Furthermore, we assessed the importance of stand structural features to polypore communities, and contrasted regions with different land-use history. Altogether 69 key habitats and 70 controls were inventoried in four regions across southern Finland. A total of 28,023 surveyed dead-wood units had 3,307 occurrences of 114 species of which 25 species were red-listed. Key habitats hosted on average 28% (about two species) more polypore species (mainly deciduous-specialists) than controls because of a larger average volume of dead wood and a higher proportion of dead deciduous wood. However, the average number of red-listed species was low and did not differ between the two forest categories. We detected a landscape effect connected with the intensity and length of forest management history, with the highest numbers of all and red-listed species per site in eastern Finland. Volume and diversity of dead wood were the most important variables explaining variation in species richness. Presently, key habitats in managed forests appear to contribute only little to the conservation of red-listed polypore species.

AB  - Lathyrus vernus (L.) Bernh. is a diploid, long-lived perennial and insect-pollinated herb with no special adaptation to long-distance dispersal. It occurs on neutral soil in deciduous forests throughout western Eurasia. Due to specific habitat preferences, L. vernus has a fragmented distribution with isolated populations. We investigated allozyme variation at eleven loci in 20 populations of L. vernus from one geographically central region (the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic) and two geographically marginal regions (southern and central Sweden) in the species present-day distribution. There was a clear differentiation between the three regions and the genetic distance between the populations was highly correlated with geographic distance. The total genetic diversity (H-T) was 0.354. The proportion of genetic diversity due to differentiation between regions, and to differentiation between populations within regions, accounted for 10% each. There was no difference in level of genetic diversity between the three regions. No significant difference in level of genetic diversity was found between small and large populations. The genetic diversity in L. vernus may either be a result of the long generation-time of the species or peculiarities in the post-glacial migration species, e.g, survival only in refugia far east of the sampled populations and/or migration as a continuous process not involving founder-events.

AB  - In the warming Arctic, aquatic habitats are in flux and salmon are exploring their options. Adult Pacific salmon, including sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) have been captured throughout the Arctic. Pink and chum salmon are the most common species found in the Arctic today. These species are less dependent on freshwater habitats as juveniles and grow quickly in marine habitats. Putative spawning populations are rare in the North American Arctic and limited to pink salmon in drainages north of Point Hope, Alaska, chum salmon spawning rivers draining to the northwestern Beaufort Sea, and small populations of chum and pink salmon in Canada's Mackenzie River. Pacific salmon have colonized several large river basins draining to the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas in the Russian Arctic. These populations probably developed from hatchery supplementation efforts in the 1960's. Hundreds of populations of Arctic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are found in Russia, Norway and Finland. Atlantic salmon have extended their range eastward as far as the Kara Sea in central Russian. A small native population of Atlantic salmon is found in Canada's Ungava Bay. The northern tip of Quebec seems to be an Atlantic salmon migration barrier for other North American stocks. Compatibility between life history requirements and ecological conditions are prerequisite for salmon colonizing Arctic habitats. Broad-scale predictive models of climate change in the Arctic give little information about feedback processes contributing to local conditions, especially in freshwater systems. This paper reviews the recent history of salmon in the Arctic and explores various patterns of climate change that may influence range expansions and future sustainability of salmon in Arctic habitats. A summary of the research needs that will allow informed expectation of further Arctic colonization by salmon is given.

AB  - An important task in research about natural resource management is to communicate the utility of different approaches from various settings. Using ecosystem services as a conceptual frame, we study a local solution to alleviate goose-human conflicts in an agricultural region in Sweden. Increasing goose numbers and crop damage led to the foundation of a goose management group (GMG), comprising landowners, farmers, hunters, ornithologists, conservation NGOs, and local and county level administration. The GMG was not given any formal or legal authority. We asked: is this management solution successful? Which problems can be solved and which remain? Can the GMG stand as a model for management of other species and in other landscapes? We interviewed present members of the GMG and analyzed minutes from its meetings. We found that the GMG has autonomy to self-organize and shows adaptive capacity over time in handling variability and complexity in its socio-ecological system. This makes the GMG a sustainable solution for local management of a resource in which goose population growth and legislation are decided at other (national or international) levels. We assessed what constitutes perceived success and found that GMG is geared toward mediation of opposing preferences by establishing a figurative handshake between stakeholders. By comparing how four general challenges in ecosystem service management align with formative attributes of the GMG, we discuss in which ways this management solution is applicable to other ecosystem services in other contexts.

AB  - An increasing number of invasive species are changing ecosystems around the world. Road verges have commonly become the first footholds of non-native species in the new environments. Regularly mown road verges also offer habitats for meadow flora and fauna, which in Europe have suffered from the radical decline of semi-natural biotopes due to the agricultural modernization. We studied impacts of an invasive plant Lupinus polyphyllus on the plant and Lepidoptera species composition along road verges. The plant species composition was studied on 15 sites (with 1 m(2) quadrats) and butterflies and diurnal moths along 15 transects (with weekly censuses) in SE Finland, each site and transect representing equally lupine invaded verge and an adjacent non-lupine verge. The species richness and diversity of flora and the cover and species richness of low growing (< 20 cm) species, in particular, was lower in lupine verges compared to non-lupine verges. Also, the abundance of butterflies was lower in lupine verges. As the lupine cover approached 100%, fewer butterflies were observed in lupine transects compared to the adjacent non-lupine transects and a higher proportion of individuals were flying. our results suggest that the changes in plant species assemblages and lower plant species richness in lupine invaded areas had "bottom-up" effects on higher trophic levels. Further studies on the control of lupine are urgently needed, but meanwhile we suggest regular mowing before the lupines have shed their seeds, together with the removal of the cuttings, to be the best management option.

AB  - Unlike other segments of international food production, finfish aquaculture has so far not been associated with major food scandals. However, because of increased focus on food safety, the seafood industry and associated businesses have to respond to and document all aspects related to their products and processes. Consumers have a right to know, and need knowledge and information to be able to make qualified choices. in aquaculture good management and environmental attention is essential for both product quality and economic sustainability. One of the main challenges in all farming activities is efficient fish health management, which is crucial for maintaining and further developing the industry. In all biological production, and also in aquaculture, diseases have been, are, and will continue to present a challenge. When dealing with disease incidents, environmental, ethical, biological and economic issues must be taken into account. In animal health management there is a common understanding that prevention is better than treatment, so also in aquaculture. In many segments of industrial fish farming, vaccines have proved a good management tool to control diseases and to reduce both mortality and the use of chemotherapeutics. As seen in a recent Norwegian consumer survey, this might unfortunately look somewhat different from a consumer point of view. The perception of vaccines as foreign substances, visible vaccine lesions or pigment, words about genetically produced vaccines, and a general lack of knowledge may fuel scepticism. Even when experts are giving good and well-documented information, consumers still stick to their original perception of food, including seafood. Given this background, this papers discusses the aquaculture industry's priorities regarding vaccines and vaccination strategies, and its information policy towards the customer.

AB  - Key message The optimal management of larch (Larix olgensis) plantations in Northeast China consisted of 2 or 3 thinnings and a rotation length of 55-61 years when economic profitability, wood production, and carbon sequestration were simultaneously maximized. Wood production ranged from 5.4 to 11.7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), depending on site quality.
   Context L. olgensis is an important tree species in the northeast forest region of China, playing a significant role in the establishment of fast-growing and high-yielding plantation forests in China. However, the management of these plantations has not been optimized in previous studies.
   Aims The objective of the study was to find the optimal combinations of thinning times, thinning types, and rotation length for L. olgensis stands when both timber production and carbon stock are considered.
   Methods First, a growth and yield model was developed to simulate the dynamics of larch plantations. Then, the models were linked with the Hooke and Jeeves optimization algorithm to optimize forest management for two commonly used planting densities and three site qualities.
   Results Two thinnings were found to be suitable for larch plantations when the stand density at 10 years was 2125 trees/ha (corresponding to a planting density of 2500 trees/ha) whereas three thinnings were recommended when the density at 10 years was 2800 trees/ha (planting density of 3300 trees/ha). When the stand density was 2800 trees/ha, the optimal rotation length was 61, 58, and 55 years for site indices (SI) 12, 16, and 20 m (dominant height at 30 years), respectively. The mean annual wood production was 5.4 m(3) ha(-1) for SI 12, 8.2 m(3) ha(-1) for SI 16, and 11.7 m(3) ha(-1) for SI 20. The results were nearly the same for the lower initial stand density. The better the site quality of the stand, the earlier the thinnings were conducted.
   Conclusion In multifunctional forestry, optimal rotation lengths of larch plantations were 10-20 years longer than advised in the current silvicultural recommendations for Northeast China.

AB  - Endangered forest species are often negatively affected by disturbances. which may have long-lasting effects on the distribution, abundance and genetic diversity of such species. To understand the effects of historic disturbances, detailed knowledge of the conditions for survival and recolonisation is needed, and this requires precise information on the perimeter and severity of historic disturbance events. We reconstructed a major historic disturbance (intensive logging followed by windthrow and fire in 1871) in the Swiss Jura mountains to analyse its effect on the disturbance-sensitive epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. Tree-ring analysis of old and young Norway spruce trees (Picea abies L.). sampled systematically on a 100 m grid, revealed that (1) the disturbance was of intermediate severity, (2) a large, well-defined area of disturbance was created, and (3) an undisturbed zone remained in the centre of the disturbed area. A comparison with lichen genetic data from a previous survey revealed that genetic diversity was particularly high in the remnant zone. These results suggest that the lichen survived there, and that it re-colonised the disturbed area both from the edge and from the remnant undisturbed zone. This illustrates that a detailed reconstruction of historic disturbances, as achieved with dendroecology, is very important for understanding the recolonisation process and thus, the conditions for the long-term persistence of disturbance-sensitive species in a dynamic landscape.

AB  - Planning for sustainable cities involves supporting compact, energy-efficient urban form as well as maintaining attractive and liveable urban landscapes. Attractive cities depend highly on services provided by ecosystems, especially cultural ecosystem services (ES), which give direct benefits to urban citizens. Therefore, access to a diversity of urban functions and publicly available ES by walking and public transport should be considered when planning for sustainable cities. This could be facilitated by user-friendly planning support models. The aim of this study was to develop a GIS-based model for assessing accessibility to ES, more specifically, water-related cultural ecosystem services (WCES), via walking and public transport, with input from stakeholders. The model was applied to the Stockholm region in Sweden. Travel times and census data were used to derive measures and maps of accessibility to prioritised WCES in the region, today and in urbanisation scenarios for 2050. The results showed how access to WCES varied spatially within the region. The number of potential visitors to different WCES sites now and in the future urbanisation scenarios was estimated, and areas in need for future development of the public transport system as well as WCES were identified. The GIS-based accessibility model has potential to be used as planning support in urban planning.

AB  - Wood resources have been essential for human welfare throughout history. Also nowadays, the volume of growing stock (GS) is considered one of the most important forest attributes monitored by National Forest Inventories (NFIs) to inform policy decisions and forest management planning. The origins of forest inventories closely relate to times of early wood shortage in Europe causing the need to explore and plan the utilisation of GS in the catchment areas of mines, saltworks and settlements. Over time, forest surveys became more detailed and their scope turned to larger areas, although they were still conceived as stand-wise inventories. In the 1920s, the first sample-based NFIs were introduced in the northern European countries. Since the earliest beginnings, GS monitoring approaches have considerably evolved. Current NFI methods differ due to country-specific conditions, inventory traditions, and information needs. Consequently, GS estimates were lacking international comparability and were therefore subject to recent harmonisation efforts to meet the increasing demand for consistent forest resource information at European level. As primary large-area monitoring programmes in most European countries, NFIs assess a multitude of variables, describing various aspects of sustainable forest management, including for example wood supply, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Many of these contemporary subject matters involve considerations about GS and its changes, at different geographic levels and time frames from past to future developments according to scenario simulations. Due to its historical, continued and currently increasing importance, we provide an up-to-date review focussing on large-area GS monitoring where we i) describe the origins and historical development of European NFIs, ii) address the terminology and present GS definitions of NFIs, iii) summarise the current methods of 23 European NFIs including sampling methods, tree measurements, volume models, estimators, uncertainty components, and the use of air-and space-borne data sources, iv) present the recent progress in NFI harmonisation in Europe, and v) provide an outlook under changing climate and forest-based bioeconomy objectives.

AB  - Macrofungal diversity was investigated on 281 decaying beech trees distributed across 14 forests in Denmark, based on sporocarp inventories. Two aspects of diversity were considered, i.e., species richness per fallen tree and the incidence of red-listed species occurrence per tree. For both diversity measures the effects of both tree and site variables were tested. In total, 319 fungal species were identified, including 28 red-listed. Decay stage and wood volume were identified as key variables influencing species richness as well as red-listed species incidence. Red-listed species, however, showed a preference for more decayed trees than non red-listed species. Further, red-listed species incidence was found to be significantly higher on broken trees, compared to fallen trees with a distinct root-plate, indicating tree death cause to be important for some red-listed species. The relations between diversity measures and site variables were conflicting. Species richness per tree decreased with increasing maximum tree age and dead wood continuity, possibly a consequence of competitive exclusion of unspecialised opportunistic species in old-grown stands. For red-listed species the opposite trend was evident, and it is concluded that forest history may have fundamental effects on the community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi. Accordingly, simple species richness may be a misleading conservation measure if the aim is to conserve the most threatened aspects of forest biodiversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined how plant-pollinator interactions were affected by time since habitat restoration and landscape connectivity by comparing plant-pollinator networks in restored, abandoned and continuously grazed semi-natural pastures in south-central Sweden. We measured richness of flowering plants and pollinators, and local plant-pollinator network characteristics including species composition as well as the number and identity of interactions, allowing a deeper understanding of species and interaction beta diversity. Pollinator richness and abundance were highest in restored grasslands. They successfully resembled continuously grazed grasslands. However, the turnover of interactions was extremely high among pasture categories (0.99) mainly due to high turnover of plant (0.74) and pollinator species (0.81). Among co-occurring plant and pollinator species, the turnover of interactions (0.66) was attributable mainly to differences in the number of links and to a lesser extent to species true rewiring (similar to 0.17). Connectivity and time since restoration had no effect on the measured network properties. We show that plant-pollinator interactions can be rapidly restored even in relatively isolated grasslands. This is partly due to flexibility of most pollinators to establish interactions with the available flowering plants and relatively high species interaction rewiring, indicating that pollinators behavioural plasticity allow them to shift diets to adapt to new situations.

AB  - 290 lichen taxa were recorded in 110 spruce forest stands of different successional stages in a suboceanic area of central Norway. Mean species number increased from young to older stands, but with no difference between the two oldest cutting classes. A positive correlation was found between species number and forest stand area, less pronounced for the oldest cutting class. Several species were found to be consistently most frequent in the old growth stands and were considered old growth or mature forest species. Old growth species could be grouped in ecological entities of which 'dry bark species' (on old Picea trunks) and 'snag species' were the most important. A number of species showed preference for specific vegetation types with more species preferring nutrient poor stands compared to nutrient rich stands. Cyanobacterial lichens were generally less common in the old growth stands compared to intermediate stands and preferred the nutrient rich vegetation types. Some considerations for conservation and management of lichens are presented. Floristic and/or taxonomic notes on a number of species are given. Ochrolechia juvenalis and Xylographa trunciseda are reported as new to Europe and Norway respectively.

AB  - The clouded apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne) used to have a wide distribution in Fennoscandia. Recent population declines have, however, led to regional extinctions and in Sweden it is currently one of the most endangered butterflies, confined to three geographically separated metapopulations: Blekinge, Roslagen and Vasternorrland. Especially the Blekinge population has declined dramatically and few imagines have been observed during recent census efforts (< 10 in some localities). The clouded apollo is subject to a species action plan which includes both habitat restorations and captive breeding to produce individuals for release and reintroductions. Here, we apply whole-genome resequencing of clouded apollo individuals collected in the three natural populations and the captive population in Sweden and apply population genomic approaches to get a better understanding of the genetic structure and levels of genetic diversity in the species. We find that the clouded apollo populations in the different geographic regions have similar, but comparatively low levels of genetic diversity and we find evidence for significant genetic differentiation between the northernmost population and the populations in southern Sweden. Additional analysis, including previously available mitochondrial data, unveil that a bi-directional re-colonization of Fennoscandia after the latest glacial maximum most likely is the explanation for the considerable differentiation between some Swedish populations. Finally, we find evidence for population sub-structure in one of the Swedish populations. The results provide insights into the genetic consequences of population size declines and fragmentation in general and provide important information for direct conservation actions for the clouded apollo in Sweden in particular.

AB  - Forest management practices can not only influence the amount of deadwood but also the proportions of particular elements. In addition, deadwood resources can depend on the forest community and the dominant tree species. The goal of the present paper was to compare the number of logs, stumps and snags and their volume between the protected and managed forests and among the forest communities in the Karkonosze Mts. after a huge dieback of Picea abies. A massive decline of Norway spruce has been observed since the 1980s. The protected forests belong to the Karkonosze National Park and the managed forests are situated in its buffer zone. A total of 1366 elements of coarse woody debris (CWD) were included in the study. They were distributed on 180 study plots (10 m x 10 m) that were randomly selected. Among the deadwood elements, spruce Picea abies dominated (80.3%) tree species followed by beech Fagus sylvatica (14.3%). More logs were found in the protected forest (57.3%) than in the managed forests (42.7%). More of the snags and stumps were found in the managed forests, 56.9% and 52.8%, respectively, then in the protected forests, 43.1% and 47.2%, respectively. The mean volume of CWD was ca. 114 m(3) ha(-1) in the protected forests, whereas it was ca. 70 m(3) ha(-1) in the managed forests. The differences in the number of particular elements of CWD between the forests of different statuses were biased by differences among the types of forest community. The mean number of stumps per study plot was the highest in the planted spruce forest and in the natural spruce-fir forest. The mean volume of logs and snags was the highest in specific forest communities (beech forest and subalpine spruce forest, respectively) in the protected part, whereas the mean volume of stumps was higher in the managed beech forests. Regardless of how the deadwood was deposited, this was a positive phenomenon that contributed to maintaining biodiversity.

AB  - The presented statistical method enables monitoring of bark beetles that colonise different parts of the wind-thrown tree stem at different densities. The bark beetle, Pityokteines spinidens Reitt. occurring in forests with the fir Abies alba Mill. was used as an example. We propose a three-step statistical procedure. In the first step, a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the single gamma function, and the gamma mixture distributions are used to model the distribution of egg galleries of P. spinidens along an A. alba windthrown stem. In the second step, a generalised linear model (GLM) and a generalised additive model (GAM) are employed to analyse the relationships between the number of P. spinidens egg galleries in selected stem sections and the total P. spinidens egg gallery density on the entire A. alba windthrown stem. In the third step, the mean total P. spinidens egg gallery density in the investigated area is estimated using survey sampling with simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR). The first and second steps allow us to identify which sections of the A. alba windthrown stem should be evaluated to adequately estimate the total egg gallery density (to save time and money and to reduce the amount of debarking performed per tree). The third step enables the calculation of the estimated relative standard error (to analyse the precision of the proposed method).
   Data were collected between 1994 and 2003 (data set D1) and in 2014 (data set D2) in forests including A. alba in the Swietokrzyski National Park, Poland. D1 was used to build the GLM and GAM, while D2 was employed to validate the models and to illustrate the proposed method.
   Six main types of egg gallery distributions along the stem were distinguished. P. spinidens inhabited all parts of the stem of A. alba windthrowns. Validation of the models suggested that the GAM performed better than the GLM. The predicted and observed data were closely consistent. This statistical evaluation of P. spinidens egg gallery densities will aid in the assessment of the ecological roles played by this species in A. alba ecosystems. Similar statistical approaches can be developed for other bark beetles colonising tree stems.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to serve as a pilot study for running a physically based forest reflectance model through an operational forest management data base in Finnish coniferous forests. The LAI values of 250 boreal coniferous stands were retrieved with the physically based model by inversion from a SPOT HRVIR1 image. The use of three spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, RSR and MSI) in LAI estimation was tested for the same stands. Ground-truth LAI was based on an allometric model which can be applied to routine stand inventory data. Stand reflectances were computed as an average of reflectances of the pixels located within the digital stand borders.
   The relationships of LAI and spectral vegetation indices calculated from the SPOT data were very scattered. RSR exhibited the widest range of values (and the highest correlation with LAI), suggesting it to be more dynamic than MSI or NDVI. Inversion of the reflectance model was done twice: first using as simultaneous input three wavelength bands (red, NIR and MIR), then only the red and NIR bands. The aim was to observe whether including the MIR band in the inversion would improve the inverted LAI estimates or if using only the red and NIR bands would result in the same reliability of inverted values. The motivation for examining the influence of the MIR band resulted from several recent studies from the boreal zone which suggest that the pronounced understory effect could be minimized by the inclusion of the MIR band. The LAI values inverted by the model were slightly larger than the ground-truth LAI values. A minor improvement in LAI estimates was observed after the inclusion of the MIR band in reflectance model inversion. The errors in the ground-truth LAI were uncertain and the background understory reflectance was expected to be highly variable. Thus, the quality of the data used may be to a large extent responsible for the observed low utility of the tested channels. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A major argument for incorporating deciduous tree species in coniferous forest stands is their role in the amelioration and stabilisation of biogeochemical cycles. Current forest management strategies in central Europe aim to increase the area of mixed stands. In order to formulate statements about the ecological effects of mixtures, studies at the stand level are necessary. In a mixed stand of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) in the Ore Mountains (Saxony, Germany), the effects of these two tree species on chemical and microbial parameters in the topsoil were studied at one site in the form of a case study. Samples were taken from the O layer and A horizon in areas of the stand influenced by either birch, spruce or a mixture of birch and spruce. The microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient, pH-value and the C and N contents and stocks were analysed in the horizons Of, Oh and A. Significantly higher contents of microbial N were observed in the Of and Oh horizons in the birch and in the spruce-birch strata than in the stratum containing only spruce. The same was found with respect to pH-values in the Of horizon and basal respiration in the Oh horizon. Compared to the spruce stratum, in the birch and spruce-birch strata, significantly lower values were found for the contents of organic C and total N in the A horizon. The findings of the case study indicated that single birch trees have significant effects on the chemical and microbial topsoil properties in spruce-dominated stands. Therefore, the admixture of birch in spruce stands may distinctly affect nutrient cycling and may also be relevant for soil carbon sequestration. Further studies of these functional aspects are recommended.

AB  - Outdoor recreation management perspectives were investigated based on the general perception of increased public outdoor recreation participation during the Covid-19 pandemic and supported by survey research at local, regional, and national levels in Sweden. There is an interest in how outdoor recreation professionals perceived outdoor recreation by the public during the pandemic and whether professionals could identify specific implications from the Covid-19/outdoor recreation experience. Climate adaptation literature supports the idea that current global challenge coupled with projections for ongoing challenge requires a pro-active approach; this turn to climate adaptation for potential consideration or guidance is based on characteristics that the Covid-19 pandemic shares with climate change. Outdoor recreational professionals' review of a recent public survey and subsequent semi-structured interviews with this group were conducted to obtain outdoor recreation professionals' detailed perceptions on survey outcomes. Results show that the professionals confirm a rapid and significant increase in outdoor recreation participation. Further, professionals identified critical trends in the increase of new or inexperienced outdoor recreation participants. A positive and proactive list of implications emerged as themes of the interviews. A review and synthesis of the themes support the national goals for outdoor recreation in Sweden. Further, results indicate a current opportunity for outdoor recreation to address concerns for diminishing nature experience and support connectedness to nature. The connectedness to nature outcome further strengthens the comparison with climate adaptation strategy given the potential relationship between connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behavior.

AB  - This study investigated the importance of habitat quality and habitat heterogeneity for the abundance and diversity of breeding birds in continuous forest and in forest fragments surrounded by farmland in central Sweden. Positive correlations were found between species number and area, volume of Aspen Populus tremula and habitat heterogeneity. Spatial segregation of habitats at a relatively fine-grained scale is suggested to allow for the co-occurrence of more species. The abundance of at least 18 of the species in this study was influenced by fragmentation, and nine of these species preferred fragments to forest sites. The total density of virus was higher in fragments than in forest sites, probably because several fragment species forage in farmland surrounding the sites and a few also forage at edges. Nine species were more common in forest sites than in fragments, but only one species was restricted to continuous forest. However, several fragments were relatively close to forests (150 m) and forest was common in larger scale contexts. The abundance of most species (25 of 33 species) in this study was correlated with habitat quality variables (i.e. variables measuring the size, volume and diversity of 'tree species'). Among these habitat variables the most important tons the occurrence of deciduous trees which seemed to be important for 14 species. The second most important habitat factor seemed to be the diameter of trees, which was positively correlated with the abundance of eight species of which five are hole-nesters. Among coniferous trees, six species were positively correlated with the volume of Norway Spruce Picea abies, whereas no species seemed to be correlated with the volume of Pine Pinus sylvestris.

AB  - This article discusses the evaluation of the management of the Laponia World Heritage site (Laponia WHS) in northern Sweden. After inscription on the World Heritage list in 1996, difficulties emerged in establishing a common understanding about the involvement of various stakeholders into the site's management model, the key point of contention being the influence of the representatives from indigenous Sami people and how that should be organised. In 2011, the management organisation led by Laponiatjuottjudus (the Sami name for the Laponia WHS management organisation) was established and implemented. This organisation gave Sami representatives a majority in the Laponia steering board and the position as chairperson in the board. This marked a remarkable shift in the Swedish national management system of land in not only handing over a state decision-making power to the local level but also to representatives of the indigenous population. The evaluation of the management model presented by Laponiatjuottjudus resulted in a number of responses from several stakeholders participating in a consultation process. These responses, from stakeholders with conflicting positions in relation to the issue described above, are the subject of this study. The analysis of these data collected reveals the existence of four major approaches or narratives to the Laponia WHS, with narratives connected to nature, the indigenous population and local governance, the economic effects of the existing system, and lastly the local community narrative. The study concludes that present management of Laponia WHS, the Laponiatjuottjudus, is a unique attempt to widen the management and planning process that partly interferes with the existing national planning model. At the same time, the analysis reveals that the Sami demands for influence over land management in the north still faces major challenges connected to its colonial legacy.

AB  - Stand structure, quality and quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD) and the importance of the stumps for the Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) regeneration were studied in the Valbona Forest Reserve in the eastern Italian Alps.
   Past history, present structures, quantity and quality of coarse woody debris (CWD) are fundamental steps for increasing our knowledge of the natural forest stand dynamics. This is particularly relevant in the Italian Alps where all forests have been used by humans for millennia. Nevertheless, in the last decades there has been a noticeable reduction of the anthropogenic disturbance and, as a consequence, many forest stands have developed naturally even if their composition and structure still reflect past human activity.
   The mean volume of CVM in the Valbona Forest Reserve was 23.4 m(3) ha(-1) ranging in the sampling plots between 0.0 and 89.3 m(3) ha(-1). Of the total volume of dead and living trees, CWD comprised 4.9%. Among the CWD, the volume of logs (37.6%) was greater than the volume of snags (32.0%) and stumps (30.4%). There are no significant differences in the quantity of CWD among the structural categories. The decomposition classes of the CWD are different in the three CWD types and are the result of the recent land-use history of the reserve: the stumps are present mainly in the most decomposed stages (III and IV) while the snags and the logs are present mainly in the first and in the second decay class, respectively. The stumps play an important role for the regeneration of the Norway spruce: more than 57% of the present dominant trees established on stumps and the present density of the regeneration on the stumps is five times the density of the regeneration on the ground. Stumps in advanced decay classes (III and IV) are more suitable for regeneration than those in early decay classes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate seasonal variation of greenhouse gas fluxes from soils on sites dominated by plantation (Robinia pseudoacacia, Punica granatum, and Ziziphus jujube) and natural regenerated forests (Vitex negundo var. heterophylla, Leptodermis oblonga, and Bothriochloa ischcemum), and to identify how tree species, litter exclusion, and soil properties (soil temperature, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, total N, soil bulk density, and soil pH) explained the temporal and spatial variation in soil greenhouse gas fluxes. Fluxes of greenhouse gases were measured using static chamber and gas chromatography techniques. Six static chambers were randomly installed in each tree species. Three chambers were randomly designated to measure the impacts of surface litter exclusion, and the remaining three were used as a control. Field measurements were conducted biweekly from May 2010 to April 2012. Soil CO2 emissions from all tree species were significantly affected by soil temperature, soil moisture, and their interaction. Driven by the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, soil CO2 emissions demonstrated a clear seasonal pattern, with fluxes significantly higher during the rainy season than during the dry season. Soil CH4 and N2O fluxes were not significantly correlated with soil temperature, soil moisture, or their interaction, and no significant seasonal differences were detected. Soil organic carbon and total N were significantly positively correlated with CO2 and N2O fluxes. Soil bulk density was significantly negatively correlated with CO2 and N2O fluxes. Soil pH was not correlated with CO2 and N2O emissions. Soil CH4 fluxes did not dis-play pronounced dependency on soil organic carbon, total N, soil bulk density, and soil pH. Removal of surface litter significantly decreased in CO2 emissions and CH4 uptakes. Soils in six tree species acted as sinks for atmospheric CH4. With the exception of Ziziphus jujube, soils in all tree species acted as sinks for atmospheric N2O. Tree species had a significant effect on CO2 and N2O releases but not on CH4 uptake. The lower net global warming potential in natural regenerated vegetation suggested that natural regenerated vegetation were more desirable plant species in reducing global warming.

AB  - We studied habitat choice, diet, food consumption and somatic growth of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) during the ice-covered winter period of a subarctic lake in northern Norway. Both Arctic charr and brown trout predominantly used the littoral zone during winter time. Despite very cold winter conditions (water temperature < 1A degrees C) and poor light conditions, both fish species fed continuously during the ice-covered period, although at a much lower rate than during the summer season. No somatic growth could be detected during the ice-covered winter period and the condition factor of both species significantly declined, suggesting that the winter feeding rates were similar to or below the maintenance requirements. Also, the species richness and diversity of ingested prey largely decreased from summer to winter for both fish species. The winter diet of Arctic charr < 20 cm was dominated by benthic insect larvae, chironomids in particular, and Gammarus lacustris, but zooplankton was also important in December. G. lacustris was the dominant prey of charr > 20 cm. The winter diet of brown trout < 20 cm was dominated by insect larvae, whereas large-sized trout mainly was piscivorous, feeding on juvenile Arctic charr. Piscivorous feeding behaviour of trout was in contrast rarely seen during the summer months when their encounter with potential fish prey was rare as the small-sized charr mainly inhabited the profundal. The study demonstrated large differences in the ecology and interactions of Arctic charr and brown trout between the winter and summer seasons.

AB  - Segmentina nitida Muller 1774 is a rare European freshwater snail of drainage ditches and marshland, which has seen a marked decrease in range (similar to 80%) over the last 100 years in the UK. This has been attributed to over-dredging of drainage ditches for land management, conversion of grazing marshes to arable farmland, as well as eutrophication. Segmentina nitida is identified as a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) that recommends further research to inform reintroduction and translocation for its conservation. We used nuclear markers (microsatellites and ITS2) and a mitochondrial (COI) marker to investigate population structure in S. nitida individuals sampled from Poland, Germany, Sweden, and the UK to identify differences within and between populations. Data based on 2D landmark-based geometric morphometrics of S. nitida shells was used to determine if phenotypic variation followed genetic differentiation. Two distinct genetic lineages of S. nitida were identified in ITS and COI phylogenies as well as cluster analysis of microsatellite markers, one of these lineages was present in eastern Europe (Poland, Sweden-Lineage 2), and one in western Europe (UK, Germany-Lineage 1), with lineages co-occurring in German populations. No genetic admixture was observed in German populations containing both lineages. These two lineages were also distinct in shape, with lineage 2 individuals having significantly wider shells and taller and wider apertures than those in Lineage 1. similar to 85% of shells assigned to the predicted lineage in a discriminant analysis of Procrustes shape coordinates. We infer that S. nitida includes at least one sympatric cryptic species. We discuss the implications of these findings on the conservation status of S. nitida in the UK and Europe.

AB  - Previous literature on social equity has focused on procedure, distribution and recognition related to land use governance. We propose novel approach to examine social equity by following ideational turn with an aim to explore globally used and locally persistent myths that (mis)inform governance in practice and effect on the three dimensions of social equity for reindeer herding in northern Finland. We take synthetizing approach and elaborate and employ a comparative cognitive mapping method to classify the reviewed literature according to its linkage to the three dimensions of social equity, and type of relationship (utilizing, questioning, contextualizing) to the examined four myths. The myths of "tragedy of the commons", "non-human wilderness ideal", "noble savages", and "majority will constituting democracy" are persistently used in land use governance mainly because they provide justifications for furthering particular interest. Yet, these myths are also widely questioned due to the problems that their employment produces for reindeer herders. Furthermore, the background assumptions of the myths are often somewhat problematic. We discuss reinterpretation of these myths revolving around 1) a holistic approach, 2) considering non-indigenous local people as noble savages, 3) problems of melding herders as a stakeholder group similar to other groups, 4) steps from majority democracy towards self-governance, 5) whether social equity can be bought, and 6) biocultural diversity. These re-interpretations can inform land use policy and governance also beyond the case study. Therefore, critical view on the explanatory and constitutive powers of myths should be part of the portfolios to achieve social equity.

AB  - Urban soil can store large amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To accurately estimate C and N storage in urban soils, C and N contents underneath impervious surfaces - the most prevalent land cover type in cities should be taken into account. To date, however, only few studies have reported urban soil C and N content underneath impervious surfaces, and no data exist for cities under cold/cool climates, such as the Boreal zone. Here, we studied, for the first time, the effects of sealing on soil C and N storage in a Boreal city. Sealed soils were sampled for physico-chemical and biological parameters from 13 sites in the city of Lahti, Finland, at three depths (0-10 and 45-55 cm, representing the construction layer composed of gravel, othermoraine material and crushed rock, and the native soil layer beneath the ca. 1m thick construction layer). Our results showthat urban soils underneath impervious surfaces in Finland contain 11 and 31 times less C and N content, respectively, compared with warmer regions. This is due to a deep C and N deficient construction layer below sealed surfaces. Even though impervious surfaces cover ca. twice the area of pervious surfaces in the centre of Lahti, we estimate that only 6% and 4% of urban soil C and N, respectively, are stored underneath them. Furthermore, we found very little C and N accumulation underneath the sealed surfaces via root growth and/or leakage through ageing asphalt. Our results show that soil sealing, in concert with a massive top soil removal typical to cold climates, induces a considerable loss of C and N in Boreal urban areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.
