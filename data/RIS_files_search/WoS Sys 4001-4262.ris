AB  - In Europe, there is an increasing interest in pulses both for their beneficial effects in cropping systems and for human health. However, despite these advantages, the acreage dedicated to pulses has been declining and their diversity has reduced, particularly in European temperate regions, due to several social and economic factors. This decline has stimulated a political debate in the EU on the development of plant proteins. By contrast, in Southern countries, a large panel of minor pulses is still cropped in regional patterns of production and consumption. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential for cultivation of minor pulses in European temperate regions as a complement to common pulses. Our assumption is that some of these crops could adapt to different pedoclimatic conditions, given their physiological adaptation capacity, and that these pulses might be of interest for the development of innovative local food chains in an EU policy context targeting protein autonomy. The research is based on a systematic review of 269 papers retrieved in the Scopus database (1974-2019), which allowed us to identify 41 pulses as candidate species with protein content higher than 20% that are already consumed as food. For each species, the main agronomic (e.g., temperature or water requirements) and nutritional characteristics (e.g., proteins or antinutritional contents) were identified in their growing regions. Following their agronomic characteristics, the candidate crops were confronted with variability in the annual growing conditions for spring crops in Western European temperate areas to determine the earliest potential sowing and latest harvest dates. Subsequently, the potential sum of temperatures was calculated with the Agri4cast database to establish the potential climatic suitability. For the first time, 21 minor pulses were selected to be grown in these temperate areas and appear worthy of investigation in terms of yield potential, nutritional characteristics or best management practices.

AB  - Evidence-based assessments are increasingly recognized as the best-practice approach to determine appropriate conservation interventions, but such assessments of the impact of human disturbance on wildlife are rare. Human disturbance comprises anthropogenic activities that are typically non-lethal, but may cause short- and/or longer-term stress and fitness responses in wildlife. Expanding human activity in the Antarctic region is of particular concern because it increases the scope and potential for increased human disturbance to wildlife in a region that is often thought of as relatively untouched by anthropogenic influences. Here, we use a meta-analytical approach to synthesise research on human disturbance to wildlife over the last three decades in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region. We combine data from 62 studies across 21 species on the behavioural, physiological and population responses of wildlife to pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. The overall effect size indicated a small, albeit statistically significant negative effect of disturbance (-0.39; 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.18). Negative effects were found for both physiological and population responses, but no evidence was found for a significant impact on wildlife behavioural responses. Negative effects were found across pedestrian, vehicle and research disturbances. Significant and high among-study heterogeneity was found in both disturbance and response sub-groups. Among species, it remains unclear to what extent different forms of disturbance translate into negative population responses. Most current guidelines to limit wildlife disturbance impacts in Antarctica recommend that approaches be tailored to animal behavioural cues, but our work demonstrates that behavioural changes do not necessarily reflect more cryptic, and more deleterious impacts, such as changes in physiology. In consequence, we recommend that pedestrian approach guidelines in the Antarctic region be revisited. Due to the high heterogeneity in effects, management guidelines for different sites and species will need to be developed on a case-by-case basis, ideally in conjunction with carefully designed experiments. Guidelines to reduce the impact of research activities per se require development to reduce the potential impacts of conducting research. We identify research questions that, if answered, will further improve the evidence base for guidelines to manage human disturbance in Antarctica.

AB  - The most recent view on smart city development has recognized that the level of technology adoption in urban contexts is no more able to reflect the real smartness of cities. Smart cities is seen as a centre of knowledge, education, and creativity. The development of smart cities is becoming more and more knowledge based. As a result, knowledge has been perceived as the core component that makes cities smart. Hence, to take advantage of the opportunities that knowledge-based economy and society can bring to the city, leaders and decision makers need to develop cities that take advantage of local knowledge and intellectual capital of the population. Therefore, they need to take initiative to adapt Knowledge Management (KM) in smart cities development. Smart cities KM offers the means to create valuable knowledge that brings consistent and sustainable added value that can therefore be useful in avoiding strategic risk, better-informed decision, and finding smart and effective business solutions. However, smart cities is a relatively new concept that still raises many questions related to its relevance in knowledge management studies. This often calls for the creation, use, capture and exploitation of new knowledge. Therefore, managing this knowledge is considered an important source of sustainable competitive advantage. However, only a few studies in the academic literature on smart city initiatives address issues related to managerial and knowledge management perspectives. This paper investigates the underlying dynamics behind KM and the need for successful implementation of KM strategies within the context of smart cities. The findings are in the main, based on thorough review of literature. It reviews the concept of smart cities and KM. The paper concludes that effectiveness of smart cities knowledge creation, exploitation and management significantly influences on effectiveness of smart city development. Therefore, smart cities governance must be able to exploit and manage knowledge that results from smart cities development.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review on the research on mammals in the Far Eastern Himalaya Landscape using the SALSA approach, with a focus on opportunities for cross-border collaboration among India, Myanmar and China. A total of 124 literatures from 1962 to 2021 were identified and reviewed. Over the decades, there has been a steady increase in research and publications on the subject and their thematic focuses have been on inventory, distribution, conservation, behaviour, taxonomy and discovery of new species. There are more inter-region than intra-region collaborations in the researches with contributions from 408 authors from 30 countries. The review recorded a total of 240 mammal species in the landscape belonging to 11 orders, 36 families, and 123 genera. Sixty-one species were common to all three countries while eighteen to twenty two species have cross-border distribution between the two countries. At least eleven new mammal species unknown to science have been discovered from the region in recent decades out of which eight are endemic to the region. There is a clear comparative data deficit in Myanmar as well as areas outside the existing protected area of the landscape. Mammals in the landscape are facing multiple anthropogenic threats such as illegal hunting, wildlife trade, and habitat loss and fragmentation. According to the IUCN Red List, 19.6% (n = 47) of the total species recorded in the landscape are threatened with extinction, including five Critically Endangered, 19 Endangered and 23 Vulnerable species. We recommend strengthening joint research to address data deficit, improving regional or transboundary collaboration for conservation management, bridging the gaps of protected area network, and empowering local communities for effective mammal conservation in the landscape.

TI  - HOW DO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AFFECT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
T2  - HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
LA  - English
AB  - Background: The sale of women and children accounts for the greatest proportion of human trafficking globally, with Southeast Asia acting as the illegal industry's largest international hub. At least 225,000 women and children are trafficked from the region every year, accounting for approximately one-third of the global human trade. The health ramifications of trafficking are severe: many survivors contract infectious diseases including sexually transmitted infections and develop mental health conditions, including anxiety, panic disorder, and major depression. The complications associated with studying a highly secretive illegal trade have severely limited research on effective prevention measures. Because this presents a challenge for organizations that hope to develop prevention strategies, we asked the following question: How do social determinants facilitate or mitigate trafficking of women and children in Southeast Asia, and what recommendations does the literature provide for combating trafficking via these social determinants?
   Methods: Using a Cochrane-based systematic search methodology, five independent researchers reviewed 1,148 articles from the past ten years (2001-2011). After three phases of independent review, they selected and analyzed 61 articles to identify the determinants that impact trafficking of women and children in Southeast Asia.
   Results: Key social determinants that facilitate trafficking include poverty, female gender, lack of policy and enforcement, age, migration, displacement and conflict, ethnicity, culture, ignorance of trafficking methods, and caste status. Conversely, protective determinants that mitigate trafficking include formal education, citizenship, maternal education, higher caste status, and birth order. Recommendations relating to a variety of the determinants are identified and discussed in detail.
   Conclusions: Social determinants are central to the processes that mitigate and facilitate the sale and exploitation of women and children in Southeast Asia. Specifically, the facilitation of education and empowerment, along with the creation and enforcement of effective policies, could lessen the vulnerability of women and children to modern-day slavery.

AB  - The interactive dynamics in the food, water, and energy system as a nexus (FWEN) are critical to the sustainable development of global cities, and they can be mediated by green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in the urban area. Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making.

AB  - To elucidate whether (1) a posterior axillary boost (PAB) field is an optimal method to target axillary lymph nodes (LNs); and (2) the addition of a PAB increases the incidence of lymphedema, a systematic review was undertaken. A literature search was performed in the PubMed database. A total of 16 studies were evaluated. There were no randomized studies. Seven articles have investigated dosimetric aspects of a PAB. The remaining 9 articles have determined the effect of a PAB field on the risk of lymphedema. Only 2 of 9 articles have prospectively reported the impact of a PAB on the risk of lymphedema development. There are conflicting reports on the necessity of a PAB. The PAB field provides a good coverage of level I/II axillary LNs because these nodes are usually at a greater depth. The main concern regarding a PAB is that it produces a hot spot in the anterior region of the axilla. Planning studies optimized a traditional PAB field. Prospective studies and the vast majority of retrospective studies have reported the use of a PAB field does not result in increasing the risk of lymphedema development over supraclavicular-only field. The controversies in the incidence of lymphedema suggest that field design may be more important than field arrangement. A key factor regarding the use of a PAB is the depth of axillary LNs. The PAB field should not be used unless there is an absolute indication for its application. Clinicians should weigh lymphedema risk in individual patients against the limited benefit of a PAB, in particular after axillary dissection. The testing of the inclusion of upper arm lymphatics in the regional LN irradiation target volume, and universal methodology measuring lymphedema are all areas for possible future studies.

AB  - The plant-microbe holobiont has garnered considerable attention in recent years, highlighting its importance as an ecological unit. Similarly, manipulation of the microbial entities involved in the rhizospheric microbiome for sustainable agriculture has also been in the limelight, generating several commercial bioformulations to enhance crop yield and pest resistance. These bioformulations were termed biofertilizers, with the consistent existence and evolution of different types. However, an emerging area of interest has recently focused on the application of these microorganisms for waste valorization and the production of "bio-organic" fertilizers as a result. In this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science to determine the type of microbial inoculants used for the bioconversion of waste into "bio-organic" fertilizers. The Bacillus, Acidothiobacillus species, cyanobacterial biomass species, Aspergillus sp. and Trichoderma sp. were identified to be consistently used for the recovery of nutrients and bioconversion of wastes used for the promotion of plant growth. Cyanobacterial strains were used predominantly for wastewater treatment, while Bacillus, Acidothiobacillus, and Aspergillus were used on a wide variety of wastes such as sawdust, agricultural waste, poultry bone meal, crustacean shell waste, food waste, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sewage sludge ash. Several bioconversion strategies were observed such as submerged fermentation, solid-state fermentation, aerobic composting, granulation with microbiological activation, and biodegradation. Diverse groups of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) with different enzymatic functionalities such as chitinolysis, lignocellulolytic, and proteolysis, in addition to their plant growth promoting properties being explored as a consortium for application as an inoculum waste bioconversion to fertilizers. Combining the efficiency of such functional and compatible microbial species for efficient bioconversion as well as higher plant growth and crop yield is an enticing opportunity for "bio-organic" fertilizer research.

AB  - BackgroundThis review aims to understand the present circumstances on the provision of prehospital trauma care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly scoping the challenges experienced by LMICs in this regard. The objective is to systematically evaluate the currently available evidence on this topic. Based on the themes and challenges identified in the provision of prehospital trauma care in LMICs, we provide a series of recommendations and a knowledge base for future research in the field.MethodsA systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored and reported on prehospital trauma care in LMIC in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, from inception to March 2022. All original articles reporting on prehospital trauma care from 2010 to 2022 in LMICs were assessed, excluding case reports, small case series, editorials, abstracts, and pre-clinical studies; those with data inconsistencies that impede data extraction; and those with study populations fewer than ten.ResultsThe literature search identified 2,128 articles, of which 29 were included in this review, featuring 27,848 participants from LMICs countries. Four main areas of focus within the studies were identified: (1) exploring emergency service systems, frameworks, and interconnected networks within the context of prehospital trauma care; (2) transportation of patients from the response site to hospital care; (3) medical education and the effects of first responder training in LMICs; and (4) cultural and social factors influencing prehospital trauma care-seeking behaviors. Due to overarching gaps in social and health care systems, significant barriers exist at various stages of providing prehospital trauma care in LMICs, particularly in injury identification, seeking treatment, transportation to hospital, and receiving timely treatment and post-intervention support.ConclusionThe provision of prehospital trauma care in LMICs faces significant barriers at multiple levels, largely dependent on wider social, geographic, economic, and political factors impeding the development of such higher functioning systems within health care. However, there have been numerous breakthroughs within certain LMICs in different aspects of prehospital trauma care, supported to varying degrees by international initiatives, that serve as case studies for widespread implementation and targets. Such experiential learning is essential due to the heterogenous landscapes that comprise LMICs.

AB  - Agriculture is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and beef cattle are particularly emissions intensive. GHG emissions are typically expressed as a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) 'carbon footprint' per unit output. The 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP(100)) is the most commonly used CO(2)e metric, but others have also been proposed, and there is no universal reason to prefer GWP(100) over alternative metrics. The weightings assigned to non-CO2 GHGs can differ significantly depending on the metric used, and relying upon a single metric can obscure important differences in the climate impacts of different GHGs. This loss of detail is especially relevant to beef production systems, as the majority of GHG emissions (as conventionally reported) are in the form of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), rather than CO2. This paper presents a systematic literature review of harmonised cradle to farm-gate beef carbon footprints from bottom-up studies on individual or representative systems, collecting the emissions data for each separate GHG, rather than a single CO(2)e value. Disaggregated GHG emissions could not be obtained for the majority of studies, highlighting the loss of information resulting from the standard reporting of total GWP(100) CO(2)e alone. Where individual GHG compositions were available, significant variation was found for all gases. A comparison of grass fed and non-grass fed beef production systems was used to illustrate dynamics that are not sufficiently captured through a single CO(2)e footprint. Few clear trends emerged between the two dietary groups, but there was a non-significant indication that under GWP(100) non-grass fed systems generally appear more emissions efficient, but under an alternative metric, the 100-year global temperature potential (GTP(100)), grass-fed beef had lower footprints. Despite recent focus on agricultural emissions, this review concludes there are insufficient data available to fully address important questions regarding the climate impacts of agricultural production, and calls for researchers to include separate GHG emissions in addition to aggregated CO(2)e footprints.

AB  - Background
   Numerous clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are published to guide management of osteoporosis. Little is known about their quality or how recommendations have changed over time.
   Objective
   To systematically assess the quality and content of the guidelines on screening for osteoporosis, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards for trustworthy guidelines.
   Methods
   We conducted a systematic search for osteoporosis CPGs published between 2002-2016, using multiple databases and guideline websites. Two reviewers appraised the quality of eligible CPGs using the AGREE II. High quality CPGs were considered if they scored >= 60 in four or more domains including the domain for rigor of development. Non-parametric tests were used to test for the change of quality over time. One reviewer assessed the guidelines with IOM standards. We summarized the different evidence grading systems and extracted and compared the recommendations.
   Results
   A total of 33 CPGs were identified. The mean scores for AGREE II differed by domain (range: 42% to 71%). CPGs scored higher on domains for clarity of presentation, scope and purpose, and rigor of development. CPGs scored lower on domains for stakeholder involvement, editorial independence and applicability. Assessment of CPGs by IOM standards showed that CPGs scored better on standards for systematic review, establishing evidence foundation and rating strength of recommendation, articulation of recommendation, and establishing transparency. While scored lower on standards for updating, external review, and the development group composition. There was no difference in AGREE II and IOM defined guidelines' quality before and after the introduction of the two tools (P values >0.05). The IOM identified four more guidelines as high quality compared to the AGREE II. Examining these additional guidelines indicated that the two tools may give conflicting results especially for the rigor of development domain. Recommendations in certain areas showed substantial differences between guidelines.
   Conclusion
   Osteoporosis screening CPGs are of variable quality, and their recommendations often differ. Guideline quality as measured by AGREE II and IOM standards has not improved overtime. Guideline developers should work together to improve the quality and consistency of recommendations to improve the likelihood that their guidelines will be used in practice.

AB  - The scenario of the Automobile Industry has changed, not only in India but also for the world as a whole. Rise in demand for more sustainable mobility and vehicles with increased usage of renewable energies have given rise to a revolution. This revolution has not only been affecting mankind for better implementation of resources but has also shown tremendous greener and cleaner effects on the flora and fauna of the land as a whole. There has been electrification of vehicles, addition of superior systems to generate lesser harmful effluents and also changing the guidelines of emissions to cleaner and more sustainable ones. The purpose of this paper is to review and state the existence of different pieces of literature for the transition from Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) to Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI). Much has been written about the transition to BS-VI, the difficulties, and the positive effects on vehicle reliability, economy and the environment. In particular, this work explores the parallels between BS-VI and the corresponding Euro norms and their sequence of implementation. The aforesaid transition has increased the number of oil refineries in India that produce BS-VI-compliant fuels, keeping in mind the increased need for it. This paper explores the current state of the literature and throws light on many of the questions regarding this significant transition. The authors have tried to study the ongoing issues including the stress of inventory management of diesel-run passenger cars, the different refinements required to process and manufacture the BS-VI-compliant vehicles, people's reaction on the changes brought in by the issuing bodies with respect to the norms, to name a few. The focus of the research has been on Bharat Stage emission norms, their implementation challenges and automobile pollution in India to name a few. The authors also discuss the needs, advantages and challenges faced by the industry, producers and customers and conclude that this change is one of the reasons for the decline in car sales in India as it may affect the buying power of the customers.

AB  - As one of the earth's key ecosystems, rivers have been intensively studied and modelled through the application of machine learning (ML). With the amount of large data available, these computer algorithms are ever increasing in numerous fields, although there is ongoing scepticism and scholars still question the actual impact and deliverables of algorithms. This study aims to provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art ML-based techniques, trends, opportunities and challenges in river research by applying text mining and automated content analysis. Unsupervised and supervised learning have dominated river research while neural networks and deep learning have also gradually gained popularity. Matrix factorisation and linear models have been the most popular ML algorithms, with around 1300 and 800 publications on these topics in 2020 respectively. In contrast, river researchers have had few applications in multiclass and multilabel algorithm, associate rule and Naive Bayes. The current article proposes an end-to-end workflow of ML applications in river research in order to tackle major ML challenges, including four steps: (1) data collection and preparation; (2) model evaluation and selection; (3) model application; and (4) feedback loops. Within this workflow, river modellers have to balance numerous trade-offs related to model traits, such as complexity, accuracy, interpretability, bias, data privacy and accessibility and spatial and temporal scales. Any choices made when balancing the trade-offs can lead to different model outcomes affecting the final applications. Hence, it is necessary to carefully consider and specify modelling goals, understand the data collected and maintain feedback loops in order to continuously improve model performance and eventually reach the research objectives. Moreover, it remains crucial to address the users' needs and demands that often entail additional elements, such as computational cost, development time and the quantity, quality and compatibility of data. Furthermore, river researchers should account for new technologies and regulations in data collection and protection that are transforming the development and applications of ML, most notably data warehouse and information management with multiple-cycles that are becoming a cornerstone of the integration of ML in decision-making in river and ecosystem management.

AB  - Purpose Building on recent smart hospitality systematic reviews and extensive literature analyses, this paper aims to explore recent developments, themes and issues within smart hospitality. It synthesises existing knowledge, extrapolating forward and contributes to the future development of smart hospitality by serving as a reference to enrich academic/industry discussions and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach The research examined 8 recent review articles on smart hospitality and tourism and extracted 145 articles in peer-reviewed sources from Web of Science focussed on smart hospitality. These publications supported in-depth analysis to explore the body of knowledge and develop foresight for the future of smart hospitality within business ecosystems at tourism destinations. It synthesises knowledge and provides the basis for the development of a comprehensive in-depth research agenda in smart hospitality innovations as well as the formulation of agile hospitality ecosystems. Findings This paper illustrates that smart hospitality introduces disruptive innovations that affect the entire hospitality ecosystem. Smart hospitality takes advantage of smart cities and smart tourism towards establishing agile business ecosystems in networked destinations. Having reviewed the existing literature, the study developed a conceptual framework and introduced a comprehensive future research agenda. This includes the drivers of smart hospitality, namely, customer-centricity, personalisation, individualisation and contextualisation; marketing-driven hospitality excellence and metaverse; as well as operation agility, asset strategy, talent management and supplier interoperation. It also identified the foundations that provide the infostructure for smart hospitality, including ambient intelligence, big data, processes and sustainability, providing the capability blocks to co-create value for all stakeholders in the hospitality ecosystem. Originality/value This study conceptualises smart hospitality as a disruptive and innovative power that will affect the competitiveness of hospitality and tourism organisations as part of a comprehensive ecosystem. It identifies the key stakeholders and explores how they can take advantage of emerging developments. This paper proposes the drivers and foundation for future research on smart hospitality. The research provides a conceptual synthesis of the literature and the concepts that have been elaborated. The foundations are effectively the infostructure that enables the drivers to add value to different stakeholders. Key issues are identified to stimulate further research on the area to support smart hospitality development and adoption.

AB  - Circular economy and renewable energy infrastructure such as offshore wind farms are often assumed to be developed in synergy as part of sustainable transitions. Offshore wind is among the preferred technologies for low-carbon energy. Deployment is forecast to accelerate over ten times faster than onshore wind between 2021 and 2025, while the first generation of offshore wind turbines is about to be decommissioned. However, the growing scale of offshore wind brings new sustainability challenges. Many of the challenges are circular economy-related, such as increasing resource exploitation and competition and underdeveloped end-of-use solutions for decommissioned components and materials. However, circular economy is not yet commonly and systematically applied to offshore wind. Circular economy is a whole system approach aiming to make better use of products, components and materials throughout their consecutive lifecycles. The purpose of this study is to enable the integration of a sustainable circular economy into the design, development, operation and end-of-use management of offshore wind infrastructure. This will require a holistic overview of potential circular economy strategies that apply to offshore wind, because focus on no, or a subset of, circular solutions would open the sector to the risk of unintended consequences, such as replacing carbon impacts with water pollution, and short-term private cost savings with long-term bills for taxpayers. This study starts with a systematic review of circular economy and wind literature as a basis for the coproduction of a framework to embed a sustainable circular economy throughout the lifecycle of offshore wind energy infrastructure, resulting in eighteen strategies: design for circular economy, data and information, recertification, dematerialisation, waste prevention, modularisation, maintenance and repair, reuse and repurpose, refurbish and remanufacturing, lifetime extension, repowering, decommissioning, site recovery, disassembly, recycling, energy recovery, landfill and re-mining. An initial baseline review for each strategy is included. The application and transferability of the framework to other energy sectors, such as oil and gas and onshore wind, are discussed. This article concludes with an agenda for research and innovation and actions to take by industry and government.

AB  - Climate change increasingly affects agricultural systems, making it necessary for farmers to adapt to changing climatic conditions. An important element shaping farmers' adaptation decisions and their vulnerability is their respective land tenure system. Especially land tenure security can strongly influence farmers' incentives for adapting to climate change. We review the literature to understand to what extent tenure security and other land tenure characteristics affect farmers' ability to withstand climate change and how climate change is operationalised. 106 mostly peer reviewed studies are examined using thematic network analysis and a network of interactions between land tenure and climate change in farming contexts is devised. The results show that three main interactions link land tenure systems and climate change with regard to agricultural livelihoods: (i) land tenure characteristics influence farmers' adaptation uptake, type and intensity, (ii) certain tenure settings contribute to vulnerability of different socio-demographic groups in agricultural systems, e.g. women, migrants and indigenous communities, and (iii) the perception of tenure security itself is affected by climate change. Yet, the concept of tenure security is poorly defined in most studies, at times resulting in misleading conclusions and leaving important research gaps with regard to optimal land tenure incentives for farmers' adaptation response. Climate change is often simplistically integrated into the assessments, without validation and analysis of longer term trends. None of the studies reviewed provides a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the multiple dimensions linking climate change and land tenure. Further exploration and empirical validation of the connection between land tenure and climate change in agricultural systems is thus warranted. This should include a more critical engagement with the exigencies of climate change response for agricultural systems, such as the need for flexible approaches to deal with climatic uncertainty. The results of this review are relevant for informing adaptation policy, where sustainable land governance has an integral role to play. Designing smart land tenure interventions based on improved understanding of (local) interactions between land tenure and climate can support farmers in effectively addressing the adverse effects of climate change.

AB  - Mixed farming systems (MFS) are the main food source and exist across almost all agroecological regions in the Global South. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify the status of integrated crop-livestock research in MFS of the Global South. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol was used to identify 210 studies (excluding reviews) addressing productivity, resilience, challenges, opportunities, and perceptions of integrating crops and livestock in the Global South from the Scopus and Web of Science database. Publication details, problem statement, experimental details and research outcomes of each study were extracted into an MS. Excel sheet. Descriptive methods such as frequency counting and the word frequency cloud were used to analyze the data and identify emerging themes. Integrated crop-livestock research was mostly conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia and not much from North Africa and the Caribbean. The integrated research has been focused on farm production of human food and animal feed by smallholder farmers and soil productivity. Maize was the most dominant crop, while for livestock, it was sheep and cattle. The integrated crop-livestock research seeked to address various challenges, including the growing demand for food and fodder, water scarcity, land scarcity and degradation, climate change, disease outbreaks and social changes. The review summarized proposed strategies and approaches to improve the efficiency of MFS in the Global South. Under the current challenges, feed quality and supply can be improved through adoption of high biomass, climate smart and improved drought-tolerant fodder crops. Using crop residues incorporated in crop fields for improved soil organic matter and controlled grazing were some strategies suggested for land rehabilitation. Building the resilience of smallholder farmers in MFS can be done through diversification and ensuring access to information, markets and finance. Policies that promote the business component, i.e., markets, training, gender equality, private investments, tenure systems and technology adoption were identified for the sustainability of MFS. There is need for research that integrates crop-livestock systems and natural resource management innovations and that evaluates sustainable intensification strategies to meet productivity goals without compromising social and ecological outcomes in MFS.

AB  - The study of marine coastal food webs has a central role in the application of the integrated ecosystem approach for marine management. Changes in food webs caused by natural or anthropic drivers can lead to dramatic shifts in the overall structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems and deterioration of their services. The present review investigates the methodological approaches employed for the assessment of coastal shelf food webs at a global scale and highlights existing gaps and limitations. Out of 1652 published articles that initially met our search criteria, 880 passed the initial screening and 493 were found relevant and were fully analyzed. The information extracted included the spatiotemporal coverage of the studies; the main methodological approaches utilized for the assessment of population state variables (i.e., biomass, size, abundance) and trophic levels; the biotic components and driving factors considered; indices used to describe the structure and functioning of coastal food webs; and main knowledge gaps. Results showed that most studies have been conducted at a subnational level, mostly in the Temperate Northern Atlantic marine realm. Overall, 54% of the studies provided quantitative information on food web structure. The most common methodological approach utilized was modeling (40%), followed by non-experimental-based correlations (30%), and natural or manipulative experiments (14%). Information on population state variables was provided by 69% of the studies, while 42% employed some of the following trophic level determination techniques: stable isotopes, gut contents, fatty acids, and molecular analysis, which were either combined or used in isolation. Specific natural or human drivers were incorporated in 76% of the studies, with fishing being the most common driver. Modeling approaches included multiple indices to describe food web attributes and/or the structure and functioning of coastal shelf ecosystems. Despite the great progress achieved through the development of new tools and techniques, food web analysis still suffers from important knowledge gaps and limitations of the methodological approaches, which are extensively discussed. The present review establishes a useful knowledge base to provide guidance for future research and assessments on coastal shelf food webs, and to support ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Objectives Hospitals are significant contributors to natural resource depletion and environmental change. Our objective was to establish the extent to which hospital environmental sustainability has been studied and the key issues that emerge for policy, practice and research.
   Methods The PubMed, Engineering Village, Cochrane and King's Fund databases were searched for articles relating to hospital environmental sustainability published in English between 1 January 1990 and 1 October 2013. Further studies were found by review of reference lists. One hundred ninety-three relevant articles were found and 76 were selected for inclusion in the review.
   Results Common research themes were identified: hospital design, direct energy consumption, water, procurement, waste, travel and psychology and behaviour. Some countries (particularly the United Kingdom) have begun to invest systematically in understanding the environmental effects of hospitals. We found large variability in the extent of the evidence base according to topic. Research regarding the architectural fabric of hospital buildings is at a relatively mature stage. Similarly, there is a developed research base regarding devices and technologies used within hospitals to reduce the environmental effects of direct hospital energy and water use. Less is known about the clinical, psychological and social factors that influence how health care professionals use resources, travel to/from hospital, and interact with the buildings and technologies available. A significant part of the environmental footprint of hospitals relates to clinical practice, e.g. decisions regarding the use of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Medical cradle to grave' life cycle assessment studies have been published to understand the full financial and environmental costs of hospital activities. The effects of preventive or demand management measures which avoid unnecessary hospital procedures are likely to be much greater than incremental changes to how hospital procedures are performed.
   Conclusions There remain significant gaps in the evidence base on hospital sustainability. Assessments of environmental impacts and natural resource use are beginning to be produced, both at the level of individual hospitals and at the health system level. These are an important start, but in many areas do not yet provide sufficiently detailed information to guide decision-making. There are many areas where the interests of patients and the environment coincide, but others where tensions exist. Rising resource costs and climate change mitigation measures are likely to create an increasing stimulus for research on hospital sustainability. Such research will benefit from inter-disciplinary coordination across research funders and countries.

AB  - Satellite based remote sensing offers one of the few approaches able to monitor the spatial and temporal development of regional to continental scale droughts. A unique element of remote sensing platforms is their multi-sensor capability, which enhances the capacity for characterizing drought from a variety of perspectives. Such aspects include monitoring drought influences on vegetation and hydrological responses, as well as assessing sectoral impacts (e.g., agriculture). With advances in remote sensing systems along with an increasing range of platforms available for analysis, this contribution provides a timely and systematic review of multi sensor remote sensing drought studies, with a particular focus on drought related datasets, drought related phenomena and mechanisms, and drought modeling. To explore this topic, we first present a comprehensive summary of large-scale remote sensing datasets that can be used for multi-sensor drought studies. We then review the role of multi-sensor remote sensing for exploring key drought related phenomena and mechanisms, including vegetation responses to drought, land-atmospheric feedbacks during drought, drought-induced tree mortality, drought-related ecosystem fires, post-drought recovery and legacy effects, flash drought, as well as drought trends under climate change. A summary of recent modeling advances towards developing integrated multi-sensor remote sensing drought indices is also provided. We conclude that leveraging multi-sensor remote sensing provides unique benefits for regional to global drought studies, particularly in: 1) revealing the complex drought impact mechanisms on ecosystem components; 2) providing continuous long-term drought related information at large scales; 3) presenting real-time drought information with high spatiotemporal resolution; 4) providing multiple lines of evidence of drought monitoring to improve modeling and prediction robustness; and 5) improving the accuracy of drought monitoring and assessment efforts. We specifically highlight that more mechanism-oriented drought studies that leverage a combination of sensors and techniques (e.g., optical, microwave, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and constellations) across a range of spatiotemporal scales are needed in order to progress and advance our understanding, characterization and description of drought in the future.

AB  - Dairy milk is a ubiquitous nutrient-dense beverage and ingredient, especially in Western diets. However, consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to dairy, called plant-based milks (PBMs), to avoid allergens, pursue a plant-based diet, or reduce their environmental impacts. The base ingredients used in PBMs have a wide range of environmental impacts, which may translate to substantial variation across the impacts associated with PBMs themselves. To assess the state of the literature on this topic, we performed a scoping review of the environmental impacts of PBMs, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. Recent growth in the variety of PBMs available means that there is unlikely yet enough data for conclusive statements regarding environmental impacts of all PBM types, which makes this topic appropriate for a scoping review. We included all relevant documents found through searching scholarly databases. We found 20 studies covering 6 types of PBMs, but the literature does not examine many other types of PBMs. All studies examined use the life cycle assessment methodology. The most data regarding environmental impacts were available for soy- and almond-based milks, and the most common impact quantified was greenhouse gas emissions. We also examined the nutrient composition of PBMs compared with dairy using data from the USDA. PBMs attempt to replicate the organoleptic properties of dairy but often do not exactly match the nutrient profile of dairy. We identified a need for the application of a standardized methodology to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts of the wide variety of PBMs available, which are presented as environmentally preferable to dairy.
   Statement of Significance: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first scoping review to explore the literature regarding the environmental impacts of plant-based milks. This review aggregates all such known literature and identifies important knowledge gaps to prioritize for future research to fill. Such research would help identify the most sustainable choices for plant-based milks as well as potential instances where impacts would be comparable to or exceed those of dairy milks.

AB  - As part of the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), SDG target 7.1 recognizes universal electrification and the provision of clean cooking fuel as two fundamental challenges for global society. Faltering progress toward SDG target 7.1 calls for innovative technologies to stimulate advancements. Hydrogen has been proposed as a versatile energy carrier to be applied in both pillars of SDG target 7.1: electrification and clean cooking. This paper conducts a semi-systematic literature review to provide the status quo of research on the application of hydrogen in the rationale of SDG 7.1, covering the technical integration pathways, as well as the key economic, environmental, and social aspects of its use. We identify decisive factors for the future development of hydrogen use in the rationale of SDG target 7.1 and, by complementing our analysis with insights from the related literature, propose future avenues of research. The literature on electrification proposes that hydrogen can serve as a backup power supply in rural off-grid communities. While common electrification efforts aim to supply appliances that use lower amounts of electricity, a hydrogen-based power supply can satisfy appliances with higher power demands including electric cook stoves, while simultaneously supporting clean cooking efforts. Alternatively, with the exclusive aim of stimulating clean cooking, hydrogen is proposed to be used as a clean cooking fuel via direct combustion in distribution and utilization infrastructures analogous to Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). While expected economic and technical developments are seen as likely to render hydrogen technologies economically competitive with conventional fossil fuels in the future, the potential of renewably produced hydrogen usage to reduce climate-change impacts and point-of-use emissions is already evident today. Social benefits are likely when meeting essential safety standards, as a hydrogen-based power supply offers service on a high tier that might overachieve SDG 7.1 ambitions, while hydrogen cooking via combustion fits into the existing social habits of LPG users. However, the literature lacks clear evidence on the social impact of hydrogen usage. Impact assessments of demonstration projects are required to fill this research gap.

AB  - Background: An estimated two-thirds of the world's 3.2 million stillbirths occur antenatally, prior to labour, and are often overlooked in policy and programs. Poorly recognised, untreated or inadequately treated maternal infections such as syphilis and malaria, and maternal conditions including hypertensive disorders, are known risk factors for stillbirth.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the evidence for 16 antenatal interventions with the potential to prevent stillbirths. We searched a range of sources including PubMed and the Cochrane Library. For interventions with prior Cochrane reviews, we conducted additional meta-analyses including eligible newer randomised controlled trials following the Cochrane protocol. We focused on interventions deliverable at the community level in low-/middle-income countries, where the burden of stillbirths is greatest.
   Results: Few of the studies we included reported stillbirth as an outcome; most that did were underpowered to assess this outcome. While Cochrane reviews or meta-analyses were available for many interventions, few focused on stillbirth or perinatal mortality as outcomes, and evidence was frequently conflicting. Several interventions showed clear evidence of impact on stillbirths, including heparin therapy for certain maternal indications; syphilis screening and treatment; and insecticide-treated bed nets for prevention of malaria. Other interventions, such as management of obstetric intrahepatic cholestasis, maternal anti-helminthic treatment, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria, showed promising impact on stillbirth rates but require confirmatory studies. Several interventions reduced known risk factors for stillbirth (e. g., anti-hypertensive drugs for chronic hypertension), yet failed to show statistically significant impact on stillbirth or perinatal mortality rates. Periodontal disease emerged as a clear risk factor for stillbirth but no interventions have reduced stillbirth rates.
   Conclusion: Evidence for some newly recognised risk factors for stillbirth, including periodontal disease, suggests the need for large, appropriately designed randomised trials to test whether intervention can minimise these risks and prevent stillbirths. Existing evidence strongly supports infection control measures, including syphilis screening and treatment and malaria prophylaxis in endemic areas, for preventing antepartum stillbirths. These interventions should be incorporated into antenatal care programs based on attributable risks and burden of disease.

AB  - Background: This systematic literature review describes the potential public health impact of evidence-based multi-level interventions to improve obesity-related behaviours in adults, using the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.
   Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library) were searched to identify intervention studies published between January 2000 and October 2013. The following inclusion criteria were used: (1) the study included at least one outcome measure assessing obesity-related behaviours (i.e. diet, physical activity or sedentary behaviour), (2) the study collected data over at least one year and (3) the study's intervention targeted adults, was conducted in a specified geographical area or worksite, and was multi-level (i. e. targeting both individual and environmental level). Evidence of RE-AIM of the selected interventions was assessed. Potential public health impact of an intervention was evaluated if information was provided on at least four of the five RE-AIM dimensions.
   Results: Thirty-five multi-level interventions met the inclusion criteria. RE-AIM evaluation revealed that the included interventions generally had the potential to: reach a large number of people (on average 58% of the target population was aware of the intervention); achieve the assumed goals (89% found positive outcomes); be broadly adopted (the proportion of intervention deliverers varied from 9% to 92%) and be sustained (sixteen interventions were maintained). The highest potential public health impact was found in multi-level interventions that: 1) focused on all levels at the beginning of the planning process, 2) guided the implementation process using diffusion theory, and 3) used a website to disseminate the intervention.
   Conclusions: Although most studies underreported results within the RE-AIM dimensions, the reported Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance were positively evaluated. However, more information on external validity and sustainability is needed in order to take informed decisions on the choice of interventions that should be implemented in real-world settings to accomplish long-term changes in obesity-related behaviours.

AB  - Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) constitutes the most labile fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which also functions as a source of CO2 emissions from inland waters. However, no systematic review is available on DOM indicators of BDOC and CO2 production potential. Optical and molecular indices can be used to track small changes in DOM composition during biodegradation. In this review, we identified four different methods for measuring BDOC together with their strengths and limitations. In addition, we discuss the potential of using documented optical indices based on absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular indices based on Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry as proxies for estimating BDOC and biodegradationinduced CO2 production based on previously reported relationships in the literature. Many absorbance- and fluorescence-based indices showed inconsistent relationships with BDOC depending on watershed characteristics, hydrology, and anthropogenic impacts. Nevertheless, several indices, including specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), humification index (HIX), and terrestrial humic-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components, tended to have negative relationships with BDOC in tropical and temperate watersheds under baseflow or drought periods. Protein-like FDOM exhibited the strongest correlation with BDOC in different systems, except during storms and flood events. Despite the limited number of studies, DOM molecular indices exhibited consistent relationships with BDOC, suggesting that the relative abundance of aliphatic formulas and the molecular lability index could act as reliable proxies. The DOM optical indices explain up to 96% and 78% variability in BDOC and CO2, respectively; nonetheless, there were limited studies on molecular indices, which explain up to 74% variability in BDOC. Based on literature survey, we recommend several sensitive indices such as SUVA254, HIX, and terrestrial humic- and protein-like FDOM, which could be useful indicators of BDOC and dissolved CO2 in inland water. Future research should incorporate a wider range of geographic regions with various land use, hydrology, and anthropogenic disturbances to develop system- or condition-specific DOM optical or molecular proxies for better prediction of BDOC and CO2 emissions.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have severe consequences for the world, some of which are already being felt. According to projections, in some regions, droughts will be more frequent and intense in the 21st century. This calls for purposeful interventions by governments to mitigate the impacts. Drought-affected communities are more vulnerable to famine. The effects of drought are felt in people's education levels, nutrition, health, sanitation, and women and the safety of children in these communities. The impact of drought can be seen in the livelihoods of people affected by it. Against this backdrop, there is the need to document the effects of drought on women and children's health in the affected communities. Such a study calls for a systematic approach. This study explores the various dimensions of the effects of droughts. It accessed electronic databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, Pub-Med, JSTOR to identify a substantial number of studies using key words and expressions. To begin with, the word drought was kept constant in all combinations of keywords and phrases. The search was then refined by using the word drought with keywords, such as livelihood, vulnerability, sustainable development, adaption and mitigation, migration, health impact, and risk management to search the required articles. Only studies conducted in the period 2000 - 2019 were considered for this review. The review's findings show that due to a lack of water during a drought, the burden of work on women and children increased considerably. Most faced severe health issues like malnutrition and anemia. The livelihoods of women were also affected because of which they were forced to adopt various strategies to overcome the problems posed by droughts. Droughts occur every year in different parts of India. Actions are required to mitigate the effects of drought, including the provision of drinking water, food, aid and relief aid to distressed farmers, employment support, support for changes in livelihoods, water security, and drought-proofing. State policies and actions must give particular attention to women and children because they are the most vulnerable. Employment-generation actions should also include youth by providing appropriate training for developing appropriate skills.

AB  - Urban health indicator (UHI) tools provide evidence about the health impacts of the physical urban environment which can be used in built environment policy and decision-making. Where UHI tools provide data at the neighborhood (and lower) scale they can provide valuable information about health inequalities and environmental deprivation. This review performs a census of UHI tools and explores their nature and characteristics (including how they represent, simplify or address complex systems) to increase understanding of their potential use by municipal built environment policy and decision-makers. We searched seven bibliographic databases, four key journals and six practitioner websites and conducted Google searches between January 27, 2016 and February 24, 2016 for UHI tools. We extracted data from primary studies and online indicator systems. We included 198 documents which identified 145 UHI tools comprising 8006 indicators, from which we developed a taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies the significant diversity of UHI tools with respect to topic, spatial scale, format, scope and purpose. The proportions of UHI tools which measure data at the neighborhood and lower scale, and present data via interactive maps, have both increased over time. This is particularly relevant to built environment policy and decision-makers, reflects growing analytical capability and offers the potential for improved understanding of the complexity of influences on urban health (an aspect noted as a particular challenge by some indicator producers). The relation between urban health indicators and health impacts attributable to modifiable environmental characteristics is often indirect. Furthermore, the use of UHI tools in policy and decision-making appears to be limited, thus raising questions about the continued development of such tools by multiple organisations duplicating scarce resources. Further research is needed to understand the requirements of built environment policy and decision-makers, public health professionals and local communities regarding the form and presentation of indicators which support their varied objectives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines are important to standardize treatments and optimize outcomes. Several societies have published authoritative guidelines for patients with colon cancer, and a certain degree of variation can be predicted.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare Western and Asian guidelines for the management of colon cancer.
   DATA SOURCES: A literature review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for studies published between 2010 and 2017 by the online resources from the official Web sites of the societies/panels. Sources included guidelines by European Society of Medical Oncology, the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
   STUDY SELECTION: Only full-text studies and the latest guidelines dealing with colon cancer were included. Studies and guidelines were separately assessed by 2 authors, who independently identified discrepancies and areas for further research. These were discussed and agreed with by all the authors.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The recommendations of the guidelines of each society were compared, seeking discrepancies and potential areas for improvement.
   RESULTS: Endoscopic techniques for the management of early colon cancer are discussed in detail in the Asian guidelines. Asian guidelines advocate extended (D3) lymphadenectomy on a routine basis in T3/T4 and in selected T2 patients, whereas such an approach is still under investigation in Western countries. Only US guidelines describe neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All the guidelines recommend adjuvant treatment in selected stage II patients, but agreement exists that this is performed without solid evidence, because better outcomes are hypothesized based on studies including stage III or stage II/III patients. The role of cytoreductive surgery with intra-abdominal chemotherapy is dubious, and European guidelines only recommend it in the setting of trials. Asian guidelines endorse an aggressive surgical approach to peritoneal disease. Only US guidelines include a patient advocate in the drafting panel.
   LIMITATIONS: Bias may have arisen from country-specific socioeconomic and cultural issues, and from the latest available updates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical approaches to colon cancer differ significantly among Western and Asian guidelines, reflecting different concepts of treatment. The role of adjuvant treatment in node-negative disease and quality-of-life assessment need further research.

AB  - Geographers are paying increasing attention to the geopolitics of knowledge production. China has attracted particular interest given the state's professed goal of becoming a scientific power. Little research, however, has attended to the politics of scientific research relating to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Instead, a focus on the discourses and environmental impacts of infrastructure projects is paramount. Understanding the situated nature of research on the BRI, particularly within the environmental sciences, is crucial considering the Chinese state's ambitions to become a global scientific power and a leader in green energy and climate change. We carry out a systematic review of 537 publications in Chinese and English on the Green BRI, an ostensibly more environmentally-friendly version of the initiative. We find four main research themes across the entire corpus: 1) environmental impact assessments; 2) empirical analysis of non-state actors involved in Green BRI governance; 3) identification of overseas commercial opportunities for China's green industries; and 4) detection of policy alignment of the Chinese initiative with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For each theme, we articulate the main cleavages separating the Chinese and foreign corpuses and critique the geopolitics and subjectivities embedded in environmental studies of the BRI. The two corpuses agree on: 1) the need for a greener BRI; 2) the need for more diversified governance that engages actors beyond the state; and 3) the ability for host country context and capacity to influence the BRI's implementation. The corpuses disagree regarding: 1) the severity of the initiative's potential impacts; 2) investors' and non-profit organizations' intentions and appro-priate roles; and 3) whether China should export its norms and standards or instead adopt international ones. We attribute these cleavages to divergent implicit geopolitics embedded within the Chinese and foreign knowledge communities, which reflects broader interstate power competition. This research underscores how knowledge production is geopolitically situated even within environmental studies, which are often viewed as objective. At a time of heightening international tension, this article urges consideration of how emerging geopolitical ideas and narratives affect the practices and policies of science in rising powers.

AB  - Background: Increased dependence on Western diets and low physical activity have largely contributed to weight gain and associated chronic diseases in the Canadian Inuit population. The purpose of this study was to systematically review factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviors to guide health promotion interventions and provide recommendations for future studies.
   Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify relevant articles. Searches were conducted between May 2014 and July 2014, and inclusive of articles published up until July 2014. Articles were searched using four databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. Eligible studies focused on diet and/or physical activity or determinants of diet and/or physical activity in Canadian Inuit population, and were published in English.
   Results: A total of 45 articles were included in the analysis. A detailed appraisal of the articles suggested that many Inuit have disconnected from the traditional ways of life, including harvesting and processing of traditional food species and the associated physical activity. In the last two decades there has been a significant shift from consumption of healthy traditional foods to energy-dense store-bought foods particularly among younger Inuit (<50 years of age). Additionally, low socioeconomic status (SES) and high transportation cost affect food accessibility and contribute to poor dietary choices in the population. However, a few articles that described the mediating role of psychosocial factors reported that higher SES, increased healthful food knowledge, and self-efficacy towards healthy dietary behavior, were associated with greater intentions to make healthier food choices and participate in physical activity.
   Conclusion: It is evident that the rapid social, cultural, and environmental changes in the Arctic have altered dietary and physical activity behaviors of Canadian Inuit. However, our understanding is limited on how these behaviours might be influenced in the face of these changes. Prospective studies are needed to advance our knowledge of cognitive and environmental determinants of Inuit energy balance-related behaviours. These studies can inform the development of health promotion interventions in the population.

AB  - IMPORTANCE As the rate of publication of new and sometimes conflicting medical research increases, clinicians rely heavily on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to inform practice. However, CPGs are of widely variable quality, and there are no existing objective measures to rate the quality of CPGs.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically assess 421 CPGs for the management of common noncommunicable diseases in primary care using the validated Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument, version II (AGREE-II) tool and elucidate the factors associated with quality of CPGs.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and 12 websites for CPGs were searched for CPGs for the management of common noncommunicable diseases in primary care published between January 1, 2011, and August 30, 2017. The assessment of the quality of CPGs was performed by 3 appraisers using the 6 domains of the AGREE-II instrument. A multiple logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with quality of CPGs.
   FINDINGS Of the 421 CPGs reviewed, 23.5%(99) were classified as high quality. Among included guidelines, clarity of presentation (70%) and scope and purpose (61%) had the highest median AGREE-II scores. The domains with the lowest median scores were applicability (22%) and rigor of development (33%). Factors associated with high-quality CPGs included having more than 20 authors (odds ratio, 9.08; 95% CI, 3.35-24.62), development at governmental institutions (odds ratio, 10.38; 95% CI, 2.72-39.60), and reporting funding (odds ratio, 10.34; 95% CI, 4.77-22.39). Year of publication, region, guideline version, and scope were not associated with quality among included CPGs.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Primary care professionals and policymakers should be aware that CPGs in primary care are of widely variable quality, with less than 25% of included CPGs rated as high quality. High-quality CPGs were associated with a higher number of authors, governmental institutions, and the report of funding. Region of origin was not associated with quality of CPGs, which suggests that the improvement of the quality of CPGs should be an international concern.

AB  - A live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax (R)) against herpes zoster (HZ) and posther-petic neuralgia (PHN) was licensed for persons 50 years of age and older in 2006 and became available in Germany in September 2013. Based on the conclusion, that an effective and sustainable reduction of the HZ disease burden cannot be achieved with this vaccine, the STIKO decided against issuing a recommendation for routine HZ vaccination at this time. This decision is based on a systematic review of available data on the efficacy, duration of protection, and safety of the vaccine, and is supported by the results of health economic modelling. Both, the risk of developing HZ and the severity of the illness increase markedly with age. The efficacy of the vaccine, however, decreases with advancing age, from 70% for persons in their 50s to 41% for persons in their 70s to less than 20% for persons 80 years of age and older. The duration of vaccine related protection is limited to only a few years. The modelling results show only a slight, age-dependent reduction in the total number of HZ cases through vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine.
   The reduction ranged from 2.6% for persons vaccinated at the age of 50 to 0.6% for those vaccinated at the age of 80, based on assumed vaccine coverage of 35.5%. In addition to the vaccine's poor efficacy and duration of protection, HZ vaccination does not offer any added value in terms of herd immunity, since HZ is a disease of an endogenously reactivated pathogen with low transmission potential.
   Finally, the live attenuated vaccine is often contraindicated in persons who are at greatest risk of HZ and its complications. Thus, in the overall appraisal, the epidemiological benefit-risk assessment of the HZ vaccination did not lead to a recommendation for routine vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine. An individual benefit-risk assessment may, however, lead to a different decision in individual patients.

AB  - Background Global public health action to address noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) requires new approaches. NCDs are primarily prevented and managed in the community where there is little investment in digital health systems and analytics; this has created a data chasm and relatively silent burden of disease. The nascent but rapidly emerging area of precision public health offers exciting new opportunities to transform our approach to NCD prevention. Precision public health uses routinely collected real-world data on determinants of health (social, environmental, behavioural, biomedical and commercial) to inform precision decision-making, interventions and policy based on social position, equity and disease risk, and continuously monitors outcomes - the right intervention for the right population at the right time. This scoping review aims to identify global exemplars of precision public health and the data sources and methods of their aggregation/application to NCD prevention. Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was followed. Six databases were systematically searched for articles published until February 2021. Articles were included if they described digital aggregation of real-world data and 'traditional' data for applied community, population or public health management of NCDs. Real-world data was defined as routinely collected (1) Clinical, Medication and Family History (2) Claims/Billing (3) Mobile Health (4) Environmental (5) Social media (6) Molecular profiling (7) Patient-centred (e.g., personal health record). Results were analysed descriptively and mapped according to the three horizons framework for digital health transformation. Results Six studies were included. Studies developed population health surveillance methods and tools using diverse real-world data (e.g., electronic health records and health insurance providers) and traditional data (e.g., Census and administrative databases) for precision surveillance of 28 NCDs. Population health analytics were applied consistently with descriptive, geospatial and temporal functions. Evidence of using surveillance tools to create precision public health models of care or improve policy and practice decisions was unclear. Conclusions Applications of real-world data and designed data to address NCDs are emerging with greater precision. Digital transformation of the public health sector must be accelerated to create an efficient and sustainable predict-prevent healthcare system.

AB  - Guangdong Province (GD), one of the most prosperous and populous regions in China, still experiences haze events and growing ozone pollution in spite of the substantial air-quality improvement in recent years. Integrated control of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone in GD calls for a systematic review of historical emissions. In this study, emission trends, spatial variations, source-contribution variations, and reduction potentials of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), PM2.5, inhalable particles (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in GD from 2006 to 2015 were first examined using a dynamic methodology, taking into account economic development, technology penetration, and emission controls. The relative change rates of anthropogenic emissions in GD during 2006-2015 are -48 % for SO2, -0.5 % for NOx, -16 % for PM2.5, -22 % for PM10, 13 % for CO, 3 % for NH3, and 13 % for VOCs. The declines of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 emissions in the whole province mainly resulted from the stringent emission control in the Pearl River delta (PRD) region, where most previous control measures were focused, especially on power plants (SO2 and NOx), industrial combustion (SO2, PM2.5, PM10), on-road mobile sources (NOx), and dust sources (PM2.5 and PM10). Emissions from other areas (non-PRD, NPRD), nevertheless, remain relatively stable due to the lax control measures and rapidly growing energy consumption. In addition, emission leaks of SO2 and NOx from industries are observed from PRD to NPRD in 2010 and 2011. As a result, emissions in NPRD are increasingly important in GD, particularly those from industrial combustion. The contribution of NPRD to the total SO2 emissions in GD, for example, increased from 27 % in 2006 to 48 % in 2015. On-road mobile sources and solvent use are the two key sources that should receive more effective control measures in GD. Current control-driven emission reductions from on-road mobile sources are neutralized by the substantial growth of the vehicle population, while VOC emissions in GD steadily increase due to the growth of solvent use and the absence of effective control measures. Besides, future work could focus on power plants and industrial combustion in GD and industrial process sources in NPRD, which still have large emission reduction potentials. The historical emission inventory developed in this study not only helps to understand the emission evolution in GD, but also provides robust data to quantify the impact of emission and meteorology variations on air quality and unveil the primary cause of significant air-quality change in GD in the recent decade.

AB  - Background: Sex trafficking and sexual exploitation has been widely reported, especially in conflict-affected settings, which appear to increase women's and children's vulnerabilities to these extreme abuses.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of ten databases and extensive grey literature to gather evidence of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation in conflict-affected settings. International definitions of "sexual exploitation" and "sex trafficking" set the indicator parameters. We focused on sexual exploitation in forms of early or forced marriage, forced combatant sexual exploitation and sexual slavery. We extracted prevalence measures, health outcomes and sexual exploitation terminology definitions. The review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and includes quality appraisal.
   Results: The search identified 29 eligible papers with evidence of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation in armed conflict settings in twelve countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The evidence was limited and not generalizable, due to few prevalence estimates and inconsistent definitions of "sexual exploitation". The prevalence estimates available indicate that females were more likely than males to be victims of sexual exploitation in conflict settings. In some settings, as many as one in four forced marriages took place before the girls reached 18 years old. Findings suggest that the vast majority of former female combatants were sexually exploited during the conflict. These studies provided various indicators of sexual exploitation compatible to the United Nation's definition of sex trafficking, but only 2 studies identified the exploitation as trafficking. None of the studies solely aimed to measure the prevalence of sex trafficking or sexual exploitation. Similar descriptions of types of sexual exploitation and trafficking were found, but the inconsistent terminology or measurements inhibited a meta-analysis.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate there are various forms of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in conflict-affected settings, primarily occurring as early or forced marriage, forced combatant sexual exploitation, and sexual slavery. The studies highlight the extraordinary vulnerability of women and girls to these extreme abuses. Simultaneously, this review suggests the need to clarify terminology around sex trafficking in conflict to foster a more cohesive future evidence-base, and in particular, robust prevalence figures from conflict-affected and displaced populations.

AB  - Background: The clinical outcome of transtrochanteric rotational osteotomy (TRO) for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) remains controversial, and the promising clinical results of several Japanese studies could not be reproduced in American and European studies. Trying to solve controversies on TRO for ONFH rising from apparently conflicting studies, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates (with conversion to artificial joint replacement and radiographic failure as endpoints) after TRO. Methods: All eligible studies were searched in seven comprehensive databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, VIP Database, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and Wan Fang Database prior to June 2019. The outcomes evaluated were 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO. The odds ratio and risk difference for the non-comparative binary data with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome. The included studies were assessed for methodologic bias and potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored. Results: Nineteen studies of TRO for ONFH were eligible for this meta-analysis according to inclusion criteria. Based on the previous report, two calculation methods (Methods 1 and 2) were adopted in this meta-analysis. Furthermore, we performed a sub-group analysis of the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates (Method 1) after TRO for ONFH: Asian sub-population and non-Asian sub-population. Taking conversion to artificial joint replacement as the endpoint, 5- and 10-year hip survival rates (Method 1) after TRO for ONFH in the Asian population were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.82-0.89) and 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65-0.78), respectively, and 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO for ONFH in the non-Asian population were 0.55 (95% CI = 0.43-0.67) and 0.42 (95% CI = 0.28-0.55), respectively. The 5- and 10-year hip survival rates (Method 2) after TRO for ONFH were 0.90 (95% CI = 0.79-0.95) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.81-0.94), respectively. Taking radiographic failure as the endpoint, 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO for ONFH were 0.70 (95% CI = 0.64-0.76) and 0.53 (95% CI = 0.46-0.61), respectively. Conclusions: The 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO for ONFH were satisfactory in the Asian population, and were acceptable in the non-Asian population despite high early failure rates.

AB  - Purpose In some regions including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region where construction is one of the main industries, the implementation of BIM is still at a slow rate. This article attempts to know the current situation of BIM and explore the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach that includes a systematic literature review and a survey questionnaire was adopted to achieve the aim of this research. For the systematic review, four main databases were search considering a period of 2010-2019 to identify the main challenges in the BIM implementation. A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. A structured questionnaire developed on these challenges was sent to 206 selected from the top construction organizations from all over the GCC region. Findings A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. The respondents for the questionnaire were selected from the top construction organization from all over the GCC region. A large number of the respondents (69.79%) reported that their organizations are planning for BIM implementation in their future projects. The results show that top challenges fall under the main categories of "Organization", "Technical", "Government and Legal" and "Environment". Research limitations/implications While the paper provides an overview of BIM in a global context, however, the dynamics and maturity of the construction industry in different regions are quite different from each other. Since the data collected in this research is from the GCC region, the results are more relevant to the GCC region. Practical implications The finding of this research identifies the main challenges which GCC construction is facing in the implementation of BIM. The finding will, therefore, be useful for the key stakeholders to develop strategies to overcome these challenges and pave the road to take the advantages of BIM implementation in construction. Social implications The BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry will not only improve the performance of the industry but will also open the doors for new opportunities and employment. The BIM implementation in construction will help the region to achieve Goal 9 (industrial innovation and improved infrastructure) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Originality/value The results of this study help to understand the overall situation including the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. This study will be helpful for all the stakeholders to develop strategies for the effective implementation of BIM in the GCC construction industry.

AB  - BackgroundCreating liveable' cities has become a priority for various sectors, including those tasked with improving population health and reducing inequities. Two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, with the most rapid urbanisation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there is limited guidance about what constitutes a liveable city from a LMIC perspective, with most of the evidence relating to high-income countries, such as Australia. Existing liveability frameworks include features such as public transport, affordable housing, and public open space; however, these frameworks may not capture all of the liveability considerations for cities in LMIC contexts.ObjectivesThis case study formed a multi-sectoral partnership between academics, policymakers (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Victorian (Australia) Department of Health and Human Services), and a non-government organisation (UN Global Compact - Cities Programme). This study aimed to: 1) conceptualise and prioritise components of urban liveability within the Bangkok, Thailand context; 2) identify alignment to or divergence from other existing liveability tools; and 3) identify potential indicators and data sources for use within a Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework.MethodsThe Urban Liveability Workshop involving technical leaders from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and a rapid review of liveability literature informed the conceptualisation of liveability for Bangkok. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants in Bangkok provided input into the liveability framework. Indicators identified for Bangkok were mapped onto existing liveability tools, including the UN Global Compact CityScan.ResultsFindings revealed commonalities with the Australian liveability definition, as well as new potential indicators for Bangkok. The resulting Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework provides a structure for measuring liveability in Bangkok that can be implemented by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration immediately, pending appropriate data acquisition and licensing. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants identified core issues for implementation, including limited spatial data available at the district-level or lower.ConclusionsThis study conceptualised urban liveability for Bangkok, a city in a LMIC context, with potential for adjustment to other cities. Future work should leverage opportunities for using open source data, building local capacity in spatial data expertise, and knowledge sharing between cities.

AB  - The role of citizen science in environmental monitoring has received interest in the research community over the last decade, with citizen scientists playing a key role in engaging with and gathering scientific evidence to support natural resource management. Likewise, the involvement of citizen science in aquatic research is growing. One area of aquatic research where there has been successful application of citizen science is in support of plastic-pollution research. Plastic-pollution research benefits from support by citizen scientists both because of the ubiquity of plastic within our environments, requiring data to be collected from a wide geographical area, and because of the need for systemic behavior change at both individual and societal levels. Recent studies highlight citizen science contributions to plastic-pollution research within marine systems, but our knowledge is limited about how citizen science can support limnetic plastic-pollution research, with no known published systematic reviews. The involvement of citizen science within freshwater monitoring has been widely discussed, but most peer-reviewed literature focuses on commonly targeted water-quality parameters (e.g., nutrients). This is not surprising given that freshwater plastic waste is a newly emerging field of interest; thus, the support of citizen science in this research area is only just beginning. This review is the 1(st) to explore the status of freshwater citizen science focused on plastic pollution. Based on a synthesis of 12 peer-reviewed publications, we considered the environmental and geographic extent of the research, research scope, methods, involvement of citizen science, and data quality. We also discuss how citizen science can contribute to emerging issues in freshwater science. Through our review we found that the use of citizen science within the field of freshwater plastic-pollution research remains rare, with most projects following the contributory model of citizen participation. Additionally, methods and standardized approaches for citizen recruitment, engagement, and training were limited in the peer-reviewed literature. Greater transparency of methods and approaches used will be key to opening up the potential for citizen science within this evolving research field. This review can be used as a starting point for researchers to develop their own freshwater plastic-waste monitoring programs involving citizen scientists.

AB  - Background Indigenous youth in Canada face profound health inequities which are shaped by the rippling effects of intergenerational trauma, caused by the historical and contemporary colonial policies that reinforce negative stereotypes regarding them. Moreover, wellness promotion strategies for these youth are replete with individualistic Western concepts that excludes avenues for them to access holistic practices grounded in their culture. Our scoping review explored strategies, approaches, and ways health and wellness can be enhanced by, for, and with Indigenous youth in Canada by identifying barriers/roadblocks and facilitators/strengths to enhancing wellness among Indigenous youth in Canada. Methods We applied a systematic approach to searching and critically reviewing peer-reviewed literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews [PRISMA-ScR] as a reporting guideline. Our search strategy focused on specific keywords and MeSH terms for three major areas: Indigenous youth, health, and Canada. We used these keywords, to systematically search the following electronic databases published in English between January 01, 2017, to May 22, 2021: Medline [Ovid], PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, Scopus, and iportal. We also used hand-searching and snowballing methods to identify relevant articles. Data collected were analysed for contents and themes. Results From an initial 1695 articles collated, 20 articles met inclusion criteria for this review. Key facilitators/strengths to enhancing health and wellness by, for, and with Indigenous youth that emerged from our review included: promoting culturally appropriate interventions to engage Indigenous youth; using strength-based approaches; reliance on the wisdom of community Elders; taking responsibility; and providing access to wellness supports. Key barriers/roadblocks included: lack of community support for wellness promotion activities among Indigenous youth; structural/organizational issues within Indigenous communities; discrimination and social exclusion; cultural illiteracy among youth; cultural discordance with mainstream health systems and services; and addictions and risky behaviours. Conclusion This scoping review extracted 20 relevant articles about ways to engage Indigenous youth in health and wellness enhancement. Our findings demonstrate the importance of promoting health by, and with Indigenous youth, by engaging them in activities reflexive of their cultural norms, rather than imposing control measures that are incompatible with their value systems.

AB  - The operations of other businesses rely heavily on the logistics sector, making logistics the most crucial industry. There are multiple issues available in the existing logistics sector including the lack of logistics optimization and unsustainability operations. To deal with these issues, the concept of the Physical Internet (PI) has arisen. For this reason, the current study conducts a comprehensive literature review to determine how PI has emerged within the logistics sector to improve its condition. In this research, we present a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the present situation of the PI in the logistics literature by conducting a systematic review of 114 publications published in 39 top journals on the topic between 2007 and 2022. This paper makes three significant contri-butions to the existing literature using such an analysis. To begin with, it provides an overarching context for the part played by the PI in the overall logistics industry. Second, it provides a road layout of the breadth and depth of the research on PI and the overall logistics, including the approaches taken by researchers, regions covered, sectors examined, and theoretical stances taken by those who have explored the topic thus far. Finally, it ad-dresses the conclusions based on the different clusters discovered and the issues of existing logistics systems along with the moderators of influencing the PI and its outcomes. Given the rising significance of PI and channels for sustainability in the logistics sector, this is the first time that an effort has been made to investigate the function of the PI within the context of overall logistics performance. The paper identifies crucial gaps in research and brings to light different factors that have the potential to shed light on this essential subject. Furthermore, we argue that there is an immediate need to build new business models for enhanced adaptation and execution of the PI strategy, and we urge business managers, academics, and regulators to consider it. In addition, we advocate that professionals scrutinize ways in which the PI approach may be applied to the existing business structures.

AB  - Introduction Lower limb arthroplasty is successful at relieving symptoms associated with joint failure. However, physically-demanding activities can cause primary osteoarthritis and accordingly such exposure post-operatively might increase the risk of prosthetic failure. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether there was any evidence of increased risk of revision arthroplasty after exposure to intensive, physically-demanding activities at work or during leisure-time.
   Methods We searched Medline, Embase and Scopus databases (1985-July 2021) for original studies including primary lower limb arthroplasty recipients that gathered information on physically-demanding occupational and/or leisure activities and rates of revision arthroplasty. Methodological assessment was performed independently by two assessors using SIGN, AQUILA and STROBE. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO [CRD42017067728].
   Results Thirteen eligible studies were identified: 9 (4,432 participants) after hip arthroplasty and 4 (7,137participants) after knee arthroplasty. Narrative synthesis was performed due to considerable heterogeneity in quantifying exposures. We found limited evidence that post-operative activities (work or leisure) did not increase the risk of knee revision and could even be protective. We found insufficient high-quality evidence to indicate that exposure to physically-demanding occupations increased the risk of hip revision although "heavy work", agricultural work and, in women, health services work, may be implicated. We found conflicting evidence about risk of revision hip arthroplasty associated with either leisure-time or total physical activities (occupational or leisure-time).
   Conclusion There is currently a limited evidence base to address this important question. There is weak evidence that the risk of revision hip arthroplasty may be increased by exposure to physically-demanding occupational activities but insufficient evidence about the impact on knee revision and about exposure to leisure-time activities after both procedures. More evidence is urgently needed to advise lower limb arthroplasty recipients, particularly people expecting to return to jobs in some sectors (e.g., construction, agriculture, military).

AB  - All countries of the European Union are required to determine the evolution of groundwater quality, including trend assessment. With this aim, the Water Framework Directive advises using standardized statistical analysis, like least squares regression. But this methodology is not applicable to all situations and what's more, does not offer a sound methodological framework. There are many statistical procedures to evaluate temporal behaviour of environmental data but, when applied unconnectedly, erroneous conclusions can be reached due to bias of assuming partial or particular conducts. In this paper, a methodology for studying such information is proposed, integrating most common methods for time series analysis. To provide a sound scientific basis to the methodology, statistic intervals combined with trend assessment are proposed, after adjusting a regression curve and applying smoothing techniques to select the baseline level. Confidence intervals have been used when a threshold value does exist. Whether it is not fixed or the baseline level exceeds the standard, prediction intervals were employed. The approach has been analysed at Plana de Vinaroz Groundwater Body (PV). As a result, PV is classed of poor chemical status in regard to diffuse pollution and sea water intrusion, and consequently a programme of measures is necessary. In relation with marine intrusion, a regional downward trend has been found, showing no further deterioration. An additional outcome of the procedure is a methodological framework for the systematic review of the relevant information for evaluation of Groundwater Body chemical status, which includes additional steps to check the effectiveness of the programme of measures and update the baseline level periodically. The proposed methodology, based on procedures usually applied separately, provides a comprehensive framework for groundwater quality data analysis. It will allow more rigorous implementation objectives of the Directive. Results obtained for the developed case are more robust from the statistical point of view, because all hypotheses have been contemplated.

AB  - Introduction
   Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) disproportionately affect low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs) where 80% of global NCD related deaths occur. LLMICs are the primary focus of interventions to address development and poverty indicators. We aimed to synthesise the evidence of these interventions' impact on the four primary NCDs (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) and their common behavioural risk factors (unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use).
   Methods
   We systematically searched four online databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Global Health) for primary research conducted in LLMICS, published between January 1st 1990 and February 15th 2016. Studies involved development or poverty interventions which reported on outcomes relating to NCDs. We extracted summary level data on study design, population, health outcomes and potential confounders.
   Results
   From 6383 search results, 29 studies from 24 LLMICs published between 1999 and 2015 met our inclusion criteria. The quality of included studies was limited and heterogeneity of outcome measures required narrative synthesis. One study measured impact on NCD prevalence, one physical activity and 27 dietary components. The majority of papers (23), involved agricultural interventions. Primary outcome measures tended to focus on undernutrition. Intensive agricultural interventions were associated with improved calorie, vitamin, fruit and vegetable intake. However, positive impacts were reliant on participant's land ownership, infection status and limited in generalisability. Just three studies measured adult obesity; two indicated increased income and consequential food affordability had the potential to increase obesity. Overall, there was poor alignment between included studies outcome measures and the key policy options and objectives of the Global Action Plan on NCDs.
   Conclusions
   Though many interventions addressing poverty and development have great potential to impact on NCD prevalence and risk, most fail to measure or report these outcomes. Current evidence is limited to behavioural risk factors, namely diet and suggests a positive impact of agricultural-based food security programmes on dietary indicators. However, studies investigating the impact of improved income on obesity tend to show an increased risk. Embedding NCD impact evaluation into development programmes is crucial in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and the rapid epidemiological transitions facing LLMICs.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine whether the disclosure obligations in areas of water stress required under the revised Global Reporting Initiative standard (GRI) 303 Water and Effluents, 2018 will improve the quality of corporate water reporting. As a key new requirement is to disclose the impact of water withdrawals from (and discharges to) areas experiencing water stress, the authors examine the ambiguity of the term "water stress" and the extent to which following the GRI's guidance to use the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and/or the Water Risk Filter will enable quality corporate water reporting. Design/methodology/approach The study is informed by the notion of public interest reporting, on the basis that the provision of contextual water information is in the public interest. To explore the ambiguity of the term "water stress", the authors conduct a semi-systematic review of hydrology literature on water stress and water stress indices. To explore the efficacy of using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and/or the Water Risk Filter, the authors review the operation and underlying data sources of both databases. Findings The term "water stress" has a range of definitions and the indicators of water stress encompass a wide variety of differing factors. The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and the Water Risk Filter use a combination of different risk indicators and are based on source data of varying quality and granularity. Further, different weightings of water risk information are available to the user, which yield different evaluations of water stress. A variety of approaches are permitted under GRI 303. Practical implications Effective implementation of GRI 303 may be impeded by the ambiguity of the term "water stress", varying quality and availability of the water stress information and the fact that different water stress calculation options are offered by the water databases. The authors suggest that the GRI closely monitor compliance, implementation approaches and scientific developments in relation to the water stress requirements with a view to providing further guidance and improving future iterations of the standard. Originality/value Whilst there have been many calls for improved contextual water reporting, few previous studies have explored the challenges to implementing reporting requirements related to the determination of "water stress".

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the gaps and potential future research avenues in the big data research specifically in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts systematic literature review (SLR) approach to observe and understand trends and extant patterns/themes in the big data analytics (BDA) research area particularly in construction-specific literature. Findings A significant rise in construction big data research is identified with an increasing trend in number of yearly articles. The main themes discussed were big data as a concept, big data analytical methods/techniques, big data opportunities - challenges and big data application. The paper emphasises "the implication of big data in to overall sustainability" as a gap that needs to be addressed. These implications are categorised as social, economic and environmental aspects. Research limitations/implications - The SLR is carried out for construction technology and management research for the time period of 2007-2017 in Scopus and emerald databases only. Practical implications - The paper enables practitioners to explore the key themes discussed around big data research as well as the practical applicability of big data techniques. The advances in existing big data research inform practitioners the current social, economic and environmental implications of big data which would ultimately help them to incorporate into their strategies to pursue competitive advantage. Identification of knowledge gaps helps keep the academic research move forward for a continuously evolving body of knowledge. The suggested new research avenues will inform future researchers for potential trending and untouched areas for research. Social implications Identification of knowledge gaps helps keep the academic research move forward for continuous improvement while learning. The continuously evolving body of knowledge is an asset to the society in terms of revealing the truth about emerging technologies. Originality/value There is currently no comprehensive review that addresses social, economic and environmental implications of big data in construction literature. Through this paper, these gaps are identified and filled in an understandable way. This paper establishes these gaps as key issues to consider for the continuous future improvement of big data research in the context of the construction industry.

AB  - Objective: In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of motivation in Software Engineering. The objective of this review is to plot the landscape of current reported knowledge in terms of what motivates developers, what de-motivates them and how existing models address motivation.
   Methods: We perform a systematic literature review of peer reviewed published studies that focus on motivation in Software Engineering. Systematic reviews are well established in medical research and are used to systematically analyse the literature addressing specific research questions.
   Results: We found 92 papers related to motivation in Software Engineering. Fifty-six percent of the studies reported that Software Engineers are distinguishable from other occupational groups. Our findings suggest that Software Engineers are likely to be motivated according to three related factors: their 'characteristics' (for example, their need for variety); internal 'controls' (for example, their personality) and external 'moderators' (for example, their career stage). The literature indicates that de-motivated engineers may leave the organisation or take more sick-leave, while motivated engineers will increase their productivity and remain longer in the organisation. Aspects of the job that motivate Software Engineers include problem solving, working to benefit others and technical challenge. Our key finding is that the published models of motivation in Software Engineering are disparate and do not reflect the complex needs of Software Engineers in their career stages, cultural and environmental settings.
   Conclusions: The literature on motivation in Software Engineering presents a conflicting and partial picture of the area. It is clear that motivation is context dependent and varies from one engineer to another. The most commonly cited motivator is the job itself, yet we found very little work on what it is about that job that Software Engineers find motivating. Furthermore, surveys are often aimed at how Software Engineers feel about 'the organisation', rather than 'the profession'. Although models of motivation in Software Engineering are reported in the literature, they do not account for the changing roles and environment in which Software Engineers operate. Overall, our findings indicate that there is no clear understanding of the Software Engineers' job, what motivates Software Engineers, how they are motivated, or the outcome and benefits of motivating Software Engineers.

AB  - Background The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) represents an international commitment to equality in the enjoyment of human rights. International human rights scholars posit that, in facilitating constructive dialogues between states and human rights experts, the near-universally ratified Convention is a powerful tool for achieving global health goals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, the performance of such rights-based approaches in achieving gender equality, and empowering all women, has not been systematically measured and evaluated on a global scale. This study seeks to address the urgent need to support data-driven analyses to hold governments to account through the development of a global dataset measuring state action on women's health and human rights. Methods Standard systematic review methods will be used to review CEDAW periodic review reports produced by United Nations (UN) Member States, civil society organisations and the CEDAW Committee. Global participation with the review mechanism, the scope of health inequities covered by Committee recommendations, the nature of reported government action and the extent of implementation of each program will be extracted from each report. Only data from the two most recent reporting cycles will be analysed. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse quantitative data, and all qualitative data will be analysed using policy mapping techniques. Discussion Using these data, the study will navigate the nature and the extent of state action to address these issues including by increasing women's leadership and participation, data collection, strengthening health systems, governance and coordination and establishing new human rights infrastructure. It will use the diversity of health and human rights issues affecting women to reframe traditional conceptualisations of global women's health which have largely focussed on sexual and reproductive health, to the exclusion of other aspects of women's lives through the life course. In addition, the study will aid the development of authoritative guidance on how each of these areas of state action and inaction contribute to health inequities, and a framework for designing interventions to address discrimination against women as it relates to health.

AB  - IntroductionDespite remarkable strides in global efforts to reduce maternal mortality, low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to grapple with a disproportionate burden of maternal mortality, with malnutrition emerging as a significant contributing factor to this enduring challenge. Shockingly, malnourished women face a mortality risk that is twice as high as their well-nourished counterparts, and a staggering 95% of maternal deaths in 2020 occurred within LMICs. The critical importance of addressing maternal malnutrition in resource-constrained settings cannot be overstated, as compelling research studies have demonstrated that such efforts could potentially save thousands of lives. However, the landscape is marred by a scarcity of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) specifically tailored for pregnant individuals aimed at combatting maternal malnutrition and reducing mortality rates. It is against this backdrop that our study endeavors to dissect the feasibility, adoption, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of EBIs designed to combat maternal malnutrition.MethodsOur comprehensive search encompassed eight prominent databases covering the period from 2003 to 2022 in LMICs. We began our study with a comprehensive search across multiple databases, yielding a total of 149 studies. From this initial pool, we eliminated duplicate entries and the remaining studies underwent a thorough screening process resulting in the identification of 63 full-text articles that aligned with our predefined inclusion criteria.ResultsThe meticulous full-text review left us with a core selection of six articles that shed light on interventions primarily centered around supplementation. They underscored a critical issue -the limited understanding of effective implementation in these countries, primarily attributed to inadequate monitoring and evaluation of interventions and insufficient training of healthcare professionals. Moreover, our findings emphasize the pivotal role of contextual factors, such as cultural nuances, public trust in healthcare, the prevalence of misinformation, and concerns regarding potential adverse effects of interventions, which profoundly influence the successful implementation of these programs.DiscussionWhile the EBIs have shown promise in reducing maternal malnutrition, their true potential for feasibility, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability hinges on their integration into comprehensive programs addressing broader issues like food insecurity and the prevention of both communicable and non-communicable diseases.

AB  - Background Schistosomiasis affects over 250 million people worldwide. Despite children and the poor being key risk groups, limited research and control activities target pre-school aged children (PSAC) and hard-to-reach populations. As endemic countries shift the goals of their schistosomiasis programs from morbidity control to disease elimination, there is a need for inclusive planning to cover all affected age groups from all geographical areas and populations to achieve sustainable impact and health equity.Methods We conducted searches in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), and LILACS per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Quality assessment of identified articles was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Relevant study data were extracted from the articles and entered into Microsoft Excel 2016 for descriptive analysis.Results From the 17,179 screened articles, we identified 13 eligible studies on schistosomiasis in PSAC living in hard-to-reach areas and populations. All identified studies were from sub-Saharan Africa. The mean sample size of the retained studies was 572, with a balanced sex distribution among the young children sampled in each study. Ten studies investigated Schistosoma mansoni, one investigated Schistosoma haematobium, while two covered both S. mansoni and S. haematobium in the target population. The prevalence of S. mansoni among PSAC in the included studies was estimated at 12.9% in Ghana, 80.3-90.5% in Kenya, 35.0% in Madagascar, 9.6-78.0% in Senegal, 11.2-35.4% in Sierra Leone, 44.4-54.9% in Tanzania and 39.3-74.9% in Uganda. Out of the three studies that investigated S. haematobium, the presence of the infection was reported in only one study carried out in Nigeria. Schistosome infections reported in nearly all studies included in this review were of light intensity. Only one study conducted in Nigeria documented visible hematuria in 17.7% of the PSAC studied.Conclusions The findings document the high prevalence of schistosomiasis among PSAC in hard-to-reach populations and underscore the need to consider this population subgroup when designing the expansion of preventive chemotherapy and schistosomiasis control activities.

AB  - The global decline in insect diversity is worrisome and little is known about insects' response to land use change. Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) are megadiverse and a key component in ecosystem functioning as generalist predators in forest habitats and agroecosystems. These beetles are sensitive to environmental changes related to the modification of natural habitats, however there is still no consensus on their usefulness as potential ecological disturbance indicators. Through an exhaustive literature review and a global quantitative analysis, we evaluated the response of rove beetles to land use change in different biogeographic regions to see if these beetles can be used as an ecological disturbance indicator. Using Hill's series (qD), species density and the density of individuals, rove beetle response was evaluated for different types of land use ranging from native habitats to crops and urban zones. Rove beetle density and richness respond negatively to crops and pastures, but urban zones were as diverse as some native habitats. The magnitude of the response varied among biogeographic regions and appears to be related to the life history traits of the species that make up the beetle communities. The high degree of variation observed in the response of rove beetles might result from the lack of information about the influence of the landscape's characteristics on local response. The idea that the simplification of native habitats leads to a reduction in rove beetle density and diversity is partially supported. However, in order to generalize a pattern of rove beetle response to the global scale, it is necessary to standardize the protocol for comparative studies in addition to considering other community attributes (e.g. species composition). The use of Staphylinidae as a potential ecological disturbance indicator in human-dominated landscapes is widely discussed.

Due to its importance in organizational context, researchers are investigating it from various perspectives, making it a burgeoning research area. Hence, this study aims to review the literature, provide identity in terms of various patterns and trends, and build the intellectual structure (academic structure) of psychological capital research by presenting a big picture. It further provides the theories, characteristics, context and methodologies (TCCM) analysis and potential avenues for possible future research to facilitate the growth of the field. Design/methodology/approach This study compiles, evaluates and synthesizes the extant literature of psychological capital, consisting of 954 journal articles collected from Web of Science (WOS) database, using bibliometric techniques, content analysis, and TCCM analysis. Findings The study identifies various patterns and trends of psychological capital research and unfolds four major themes, namely psychological capital theoretical concept development, psychological capital relationship building with organizational variables, psychological capital as an underlying mechanism for linkage between organizational variables and psychological capital interventions. It also identifies TCCM outcome and potential avenues for possible future research. The study reveals that psychological capital research area is progressing and has enormous potential to advance in the future. Research limitations/implications This study is pivotal to past-future orientation wherein past is being investigated for developing new pathways of psychological capital research. It has used research articles published in the WOS database, and future studies may further enhance the understanding of psychological research using other databases. Practical implications In addition to advance a comprehensive understanding of psychological capital research, this study will be a quick reference and notable and profound resource for researchers venturing into this marked research area. Further, it will facilitate to leaders and managers to look into various possible avenues to enhance psychological capital of their subordinates for greater organizational good. Originality/value To the best of authors' knowledge, this is first study to advance a comprehensive and systematic understanding of psychological capital by integrating bibliometric, TCCM and content analysis.

AB  - Shoreline change and coastal erosion resulting from natural events such as sea level rise and negative anthropogenic activities continue to be problems in many of the world's coastal regions. Many coastal socio-ecological systems have become vulnerable as a result, especially in developing countries with less adaptive capacity. We utilized the systematic method to understand the research progress and policy recommendations on shoreline change and coastal erosion in West Africa. A total of 113 documents were retrieved from Scopus and the Web of Sciences databases, and 43 documents were eligible following established criteria. It was revealed that research on shoreline change and coastal erosion has progressed substantially since 1998, with most research studies originating from the Ghanaian territory. Again, most of the shoreline change and erosion problems in West Africa result from natural events such as sea level rise. However, there was evidence of anthropogenic influences such as sand mining, dam construction, and human encroachment causing shoreline change and erosion in the region. Research in the region has also progressed in terms of methodological approaches. Since 2004, researchers have utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to source and analyze shoreline change and erosion. However, a combination of remote sensing and field observation approaches is required to clearly depict the erosion problems and aid policy direction. The overall call to action regarding policy recommendations revolves around improving coastal adaptation measures and the resilience of communities, instituting proper coastal zone management plans, and improving shoreline change and coastal erosion research. To protect lives and property, policymakers in the region need to set up good coastal zone management plans, strengthen adaptation measures, and make coastal communities more resistant to possible risks.

AB  - Invasive species are one of the most pressing global challenges for biodiversity and agriculture. They can cause species extinctions, ecosystem alterations, crop damage, and spread harmful diseases across broad regions. Overcoming this challenge requires collaborative management efforts that span multiple land tenures and jurisdictions. Despite evidence on the importance and approaches to collaboration, there is little understanding of how success is evaluated in the invasive species management literature. This is a major gap, considering evaluating success is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of future management projects. To overcome this knowledge gap, we systematically reviewed the published literature to identify the stages at which success is evaluated - that is, the Process stage (collaborative management actions and Processes), Outputs stage (results of management actions to protect environmental, economic, and social values) and Outcomes stage (effects of Outputs on environmental, economic, and social values) of collaborative invasive species management projects. We also assessed what indicators were used to identify success and whether these evaluations vary across different characteristics of collaborative invasive species management. Our literature search detected 1406 papers, of which 58 met our selection criteria. Out of these, the majority of papers evaluated success across two stages (n = 25, 43.1%), whereas only ten (17.2%) papers evaluated success across all stages. Outputs were the most commonly evaluated stage (n = 40, 68.9%). The most widely used indicators of success for these stages included increased collaboration of stakeholders (Process stage), the number of captured/eradicated/controlled invasive species (Outputs stage) and change in biodiversity values, such as the number of threatened species (Outcomes stage). Most indicators of success were environmentally focused. We highlight the need to align the indicators of success and evaluation stages with the fundamental objectives of the projects to increase the effectiveness of evaluations and thereby maximise the benefits of collaborative invasive species management.

AB  - Objective: By comparing the Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening (UNHS) program as implemented in Shanghai and other regions in China and countries around the world, this study makes an assessment of the Shanghai model and summarizes the experiences implementing the UNHS program, so as to provide a valuable reference for other countries or regions to carry out UNHS more effectively. Since Shanghai is one of the most developed regions in China, we also examined the relationship between economic development and the UNHS starting year and coverage rate.
   Methods: The study conducted a systematic review of published studies in Chinese and English on the program status of neonatal hearing screening to compare and analyze the implementation of the UNHS program in 20 cities or provinces in China and 24 regions or countries around the world. The literature search in Chinese was conducted in the three most authoritative publication databases, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), WANFANGDATA, and CQVIP (http://www.ccivip.comi). We searched all publications in those databases with the keywords "neonatal hearing screening" (in Chinese) between 2005 and 2014. English literature was searched using the same keywords (in English). The publication database included Medline and Web of Science, and the search time period was 2000-2014.
   Results: Shanghai was one of the first regions in China to implement UNHS, and its coverage rate was among the top regions by international comparison. The starting time of the UNHS program had no relationship with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in the same year. Economic level serves as a threshold for carrying out UNHS but is not a linear contributor to the exact starting time of such a program. The screening coverage rate generally showed a rising trend with the increasing GDP per capita in China, but it had no relationship with the area's GDP per capita in selected regions and countries around the world. The system design of UNHS is the key factor influencing screening coverage. Policy makers, program administrators, and cost-sharing structures are important factors that influence the coverage rates of UNHS.
   Conclusion: When to carry out a UNHS program is determined by the willingness and preference of the local government, which is influenced by the area's social, political and cultural conditions. Mandatory hearing screening and minimal-cost to no-cost intervention are two pillars for a good coverage rate of UNHS. In terms of system design, decision-making, implementation, funding and the concrete implementation plan are all important factors affecting the implementation of the UNHS. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Research on estuarine ecology in South America (SA) increased quail-quantitatively since the early 1980 in search of consistent recommendations for estuarine conservation. The most important ecological theory achieved is that the seasonal fluctuation of the salinity gradient creates an ecocline influenced by gradual changes between river-dominated to marine-like waters. Estuarine fish fauna adapts to these changeable abiotic characteristics, including the spatial, and seasonal bioavailability of dissolved oxygen and numerous pollutants. However, studies on the influence of the estuarine ecocline are still missing for key estuarine systems. This study provides an overview of fish ecology and anthropogenic impacts within estuarine systems of SA and discusses priorities for environmental conservation. Research on fish reached important conclusions regarding essential habitats and fish interaction with other biological and abiotic compartments over spatio-temporal settings, including conditions of severe anthropogenic impacts. These impacts are related to unplanned urban settlements, industrial estates, ports, damming of major rivers, dredging activities, and deforestation for extensive farming. Changes in estuarine morphology alter natural flows and lead to habitat losses, disrupting the ecocline and impairing fishes from moving among formerly connected habitats, especially earlier ontogenetic phases. In addition, industrial, urban, and farming activities often result in high loads of metals and persistent organic pollutants, organic enrichment and oxygen depletion. Moreover, plastic debris, a ubiquitous contaminant with sources on every human activity, including fishing, when fragmented into microplastics, become preferably concentrated in semi-enclosed environments, as estuaries. Metals, POPs and microplastics are actually asserted to be persistent. When in high concentrations, they become bioavailable to the estuarine trophic web through bioaccumulation, being biomagnified or biotransfered toward higher trophic level organisms, such as top predator fishes. Therefore, research on environmental quality and fish ecology must be based on robust sampling designs along the whole ecocline using long-term approaches. In addition, basic sanitation, co-management, an improved licensing system and scientifically-based risk assessments/monitoring for all sorts of enterprise are also urgent. These conservation priorities need to be in place before human-driven changes surpass the ecosystem's capacity to produce resources and maintain services.

AB  - IntroductionMicromobility initiatives, including electric scooters (e-scooters), are part of the United Kingdom government's sustainability drive. Since summer 2020, multiple trials have been conducted across the United Kingdom. Safety concerns have been raised around e-scooters joining other vehicles on United Kingdom roads, alongside the numerous private e-scooters illegally ridden on public land. Although literature has been published abroad on perceptions, risk-taking behaviours and attitudes surrounding e-scooters, independent United Kingdom research has concentrated on analysing trauma. Our aim was to identify common themes and recommendations to form conclusions on factors affecting e-scooter trauma hospital admissions.MethodsA systematic literature search in June 2023 extracted studies focused on the primary outcomes of risk factors, perceptions, and attitudes surrounding e-scooters globally from the EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Sciences databases. Two independent reviewers conducted a critical appraisal to extract potential biases and study characteristics. A critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) analysis was also completed. Two online surveys distributed in Birmingham and Wolverhampton focused on: public perception towards e-scooters, and road user attitudes around e-scooters. The target population was residents of the West Midlands who were both riders and non-riders of e-scooters. The surveys were opened in late-March 2023 and closed in late-July 2023.Results443 studies were retrieved with 13 studies being eligible according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. CASP assessment concluded that the studies were of good quality, however heterogeneity meant sample sizes could not be meaningfully aggregated. Many studies focused on safety concerns whilst others observed risk-taking behaviour, non-rider perceptions, and infrastructure. Our surveys received 299 responses and respondents reported risk-taking behaviours such as pavement riding, alcohol consumption, and minimal helmet use. However, positive opinions were expressed on e-scooter convenience but concerns were raised regarding rider and non-rider safety.DiscussionWhilst global literature had investigated e-scooter attitudes, risk-taking behaviours and perceptions, there was no comparable independent United Kingdom literature. Our literature review and analysis of survey responses concluded that e-scooters were perceived as a sustainable form of transport; however, safety concerns were raised. Our study points to risk-taking behaviours by riders being associated with admissions into hospital emergency departments. We conclude that well maintained infrastructure could improve the safety of both e-scooter riders and vulnerable pedestrians, whilst education and enforcement of clear rules may reduce risk-taking behaviour. The recommendations found in the PACTS reports, and documents from the RNIB confirm our findings. We recommend that hospital data and future studies should differentiate between private and rental e-scooters for robust conclusions to be made.

AB  - Tourism is one of most perspective and dynamic businesses in the world. It is of great significance to plan and develop tourism purposefully and sustainably though the search for compromises between environmental, economic and social aims of society. The sustainable tourism development management has to retain high satisfaction degree of tourists' needs, assure significant experience for consumers, increasing their consciousness under issues of sustainability, and propagating practices of sustainable tourism among them. The significance of sustainable tourism sector development ambition is analysed in this paper through the lens of strengthening its competitiveness. The paper analyses scientific literature and seeks to discover the main forms and factors for the strengthening of the tourism competitiveness by implementing economic, social and environmental targets of tourism destination territories development. The broad systematic literature review provided for some interesting findings: The business participants are interested in the implementation of new technologies in tourism services having positive impact on environment and local communities; however, a lot of challenges exist how to change environment, increase of consumers' motivations for sustainable tourism services and to change their behaviour towards more sustainable one. The current Covid 19 outbreak and high risks of future pandemics have risen new challenges for sustainable tourism development. In this paper the main sustainable tourist development challenges are addressed and new insights for the strengthening of competitiveness of sustainable tourism destination are provided. The future research guidelines are set based on analysis performed. Highlights

AB  - The impacts of plant invasion on biodiversity are substantially visible and concerning. Despite the numerous studies conducted on the management of invasive alien plants (MIAPs), limited reviews are available on how to restore the lost diversity of native communities after the control of invasive alien plants. Here, through a systematic review we synthesize recent developments related to the restoration of native plant communities after MIAP and provide a checklist to make decisions for addressing various outstanding questions based on different contexts. We address (1) how the restoration of biodiversity after the MIAP could be improved by controlling reinvasion and novel invaders, and (2) what kind of follow up restoration methods should be employed to increase the diversity and functioning of native communities. Further, we briefly describe the importance of managing multitrophic interactions for reestablishing self-sustainable native plant communities after restoration. This review will guide researchers and restoration practitioners on how to move beyond the MIAP to conduct more research, and what actions to take for restoring the diversity of native communities on temporal and spatial scales. Based on the review of the state of knowledge, we offer the following practical implications: (1) given the investment of resources to curb invasive alien plants, active restoration efforts post invasion control are critical for effective recovery of biodiversity, regardless of the type of control method employed; (2) reducing the abundance of invasive seedbank, a robust legacy of invasion, and managing the arrival of new invasive seeds from the surroundings are crucial before the sowing or planting of native species; and (3) aiming to restore the desired diversity of native plant communities requires a thorough understanding of the conditions and level of assisted active restoration to implement the different practices.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to analyze whether symmetry of left and right sides, gender, measuring method, and ethnicity have influences on width (W), length (L), and width to length ratio (W/L) of the maxillary central incisor (MCI) and provide a reference for dental treatment planning in the esthetic zone. Materials and Methods An electronic search was conduct of the dental literature. Studies reporting data about measurements were included. Data were extracted and analyzed for the differences between left and right, male and female, different measuring methods, and ethnicities by Review Manager and Stata statistical software. Results Seventeen studies were included. There were no differences between measurement of the left and right groups, perceived and actual measuring groups. However, differences were found between genders in MCI'sWandLbut no difference inW/L. Differences were also found between Asians and Caucasian subjects in MCI'sW,L, andW/L. Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest that symmetry of left and right sides and measuring method do not influence MCI dimension. Gender and ethnicity are found as influence factors for MCI dimension. We believe these findings can be helpful for dentists to decide and design the dimensions of the restorations for maxillary anterior teeth in clinical practices. Clinical significance
   In the process of designing maxillary anterior teeth for implantation, the contralateral MCI can be helpful to create a symmetrical esthetic restoration. For patients with maxillary anterior tooth loss or diastemas, dentists should divide the left and right space equally and keep the MCI contact area aligned with the midline. Dentists should take face size and gender into consideration when making treatment plans for the MCI. Facial parameters as well as the size ratios of the previous teeth can be evaluated and may influence the size and shape of the teeth. When measuring anterior teeth or facial dimensions for esthetic evaluation, the recommended method is to measure the perceived sizes of a facial view image created by a digital camera. Slight discrepancies may exist between the actual and measured values due to the curvature of the arch and the angle in which the photograph was taken.

AB  - y A central question in contemporary ecology is how climate change will alter ecosystem structure and function across scales of space and time. Climate change has been shown to alter ecological patterns from individuals to ecosystems, often with negative implications for ecosystem functions and services. Furthermore, as climate change fuels more frequent and severe extreme climate events (ECEs) like marine heatwaves (MHWs), such acute events become increasingly important drivers of rapid ecosystem change. However, our understanding of ECE impacts is hampered by limited collection of broad scale in situ data where such events occur. In 2011, a MHW known as the Ningaloo Nino bathed the west coast of Australia in waters up to 4 degrees C warmer than normal summer temperatures for almost 2 months over 1000s of kilometers of coastline. We revisit published and unpublished data on the effects of the Ningaloo Nino in the seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia (24.6-26.6 degrees S), at the transition zone between temperate and tropical seagrasses. Therein we focus on resilience, including resistance to and recovery from disturbance across local, regional and ecosystem-wide spatial scales and over the past 8 years. Thermal effects on temperate seagrass health were severe and exacerbated by simultaneous reduced light conditions associated with sediment inputs from record floods in the south-eastern embayment and from increased detrital loads and sediment destabilization. Initial extensive defoliation of Amphibolis antarctica, the dominant seagrass, was followed by rhizome death that occurred in 60-80% of the bay's meadows, equating to decline of over 1,000 km(2) of meadows. This loss, driven by direct abiotic forcing, has persisted, while indirect biotic effects (e.g., dominant seagrass loss) have allowed colonization of some areas by small fast-growing tropical@species (e.g., Halodule uninervis). Those biotic effects also impacted multiple consumer populations including turtles and dugongs, with implications for species dynamics, food web structure, and ecosystem recovery. We show multiple stressors can combine to evoke extreme ecological responses by pushing ecosystems beyond their tolerance. Finally, both direct abiotic and indirect biotic effects need to be explicitly considered when attempting to understand and predict how ECEs will alter marine ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Soil invertebrates have an essential role in decomposition, nutrient turnover and soil structure formation, all of which are strongly threatened by urbanization. Sealing, compaction by trampling and pollution destroy and degrade city soils and potentially damage soil-living invertebrates. The existing literature on how urbanization affects soil invertebrates is inconsistent, presenting both negative and positive effects. Therefore, here we aimed to synthesize the effects of urbanization on soil invertebrates considering their taxonomic (Acari, Annelida, Carabidae, Collembola, Gastropoda, Isopoda, Myriapoda, Nematoda) and functional (soil living vs. soil-related; mobility) identities, as well as to examine how the overall effect is modulated by climatic conditions (total annual precipitation, annual mean ambient temperature), urban heat island effect (based on ambient temperature differences between urban and rural areas) and city population. In a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses, we extracted 158 effect sizes from 75 studies on abundance and 125 effect sizes from84 studies on species richness. Invertebrate abundance showed an increase (r= 0.085), whereas species richness significantly decreased with increasing urbanization (r=-0.168). The reason behind this could be that a few generalist species can adapt well to the urban environment and achieve strongly elevated densities. The species richness of annelids (r = -0.301), springtails (r = -0.579), and snails (r=-0.233) decreased with advancing urbanization, most probably because these animals are sensitive to soil compaction and pollution, both of which are common consequences of urbanization. The temperature did not modify the effects of urbanization, but precipitation modified the effects on abundance (r=-0.457). Abundance increased with advancing urbanization in drier climates, probably because irrigation increased soil moisture, whereas it decreased in wet climates, as urban areas were drier than their surroundings. Making future citiesmore climate-neutral could better sustain soil biodiversity.

AB  - 1. INTRODUCTION, GAPS, AND OBJECTIVES
   Decades of environmental degradation have contributed to transitioning the sustainability discourse from the scientific and technological (Ioannidis and Chalvatzis 2017; Pappas et al. 2018) to the public and corporate domains. Within this context, stakeholders aim to control and mitigate environmental degradation represent wide-ranging institutions and organisations (Goworek et al. 2018; Kumar 2016). Among them, corporate organisations are under pressure to implement strategies that will lead to improved environmental and business performance, which have attracted strong attention in the marketing/management field (Tollin and Christensen 2019). This is particularly true in an international business context, where due to growing globalization trends, firms have to demonstrate responsible citizenship for sustainability not only in their home market, but also in host countries. However, sustainability has been conceptualized in a relatively vague way by researchers, which, coupled with the great diversity of its drivers and outcomes (Chalvatzis et al. 2018) reported by the sizable literature in the field, causes confusion in promoting best practice and advancing theory (Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim 2012). In light of these problems, there is a need to systematically review and assess the extant body of research on the antecedents and performance outcomes of international environmental marketing/management strategies. In doing so, our review intents to: (a) identify and analyse the theoretical background of this line of research; (b) assess the research methodologies employed by previous empirical studies; (c) identify and assimilate the key thematic areas and specific topics addressed by prior research; and (d) identify the key variables used in the existing literature (e) develop an agenda for future research on the subject.
   2. METHODOLOGY
   A two-stage process was adopted for the present review: article identification and article analysis. In order to identify the initial pool of articles, we adopted the concept-driven systematic review method approach (Webster and Watson 2002). To accumulate a complete census of relevant literature and build the initial pool of studies, articles with relevant topics were searched in various electronic databases, such as Ebsco, Scopus and Science Direct, which provide a comprehensive coverage with full access. We have used the following keywords to identify relevant articles: environmental marketing; environmental strategy; green marketing; environmentally friendly; sustainable marketing; natural environment; environmental orientation; environmental proactivity; environmental awareness; and environmental management. This was done in conjunction with international-related keywords, namely multinational firms; global corporations; global consumers; international marketing; cross-cultural marketing; and cross-national marketing. These keywords were identified from previous reviews on the subject and were refined by two established scholars in the field. We searched these pre-defined keywords in article title, author supplied keywords, and author supplied abstract. We limited our search to articles published in English in academic peer-reviewed journals, since the inception of this field of research in the early 1960s. This initial search from the various electronic databases yielded 949 articles, of which 498 had to be removed because of being duplicated while another 167 were found irrelevant after carefully screening the title and the abstract.
   2.1 Article identification
   We critically appraised the full text of the remaining 284 potentially relevant articles, by taking into consideration the following four criteria with regard to the studies contained: (1) to be published in an academic journal rather than a book, book chapters or conference proceedings; (2) to focus on environmental marketing/management strategies as an independent concept, rather than as a sub-dimension of Corporate Social Responsibility; (3) to be of an international nature, by examining the sustainability strategies of firms (e.g., exporters, MNEs, etc.) when crossing their national boundaries; and (4) to have empirical nature, with papers having a conceptual, methodological, review, or meta-analytical nature being excluded. Only 68 articles met these pre-defined selection criteria, which were subsequently examined by two academic experts in order to verify their appropriateness. The outcome of this process was to exclude another seven articles. We have carefully reviewed the reference lists of the 61 articles that passed the cross check, revealing another 34 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria set, thus bringing the final sample of articles useful for the review to 95.
   2.2 Article analysis
   To map research on the antecedents and outcomes of environmental marketing/management strategy within the international marketing context, we proceeded with a content analysis of the selected articles. In doing so, we have designed a coding frame incorporating publication details, theories undertaken located mainly in developed economies with less attention paid on emerging and developing economies. The majority of the reviewed studies had a particular focus on manufacturing industries where there are studies where multiple industries are included which allows for examination of industry type control effects. More recent studies start to examine other industries such as energy, tourism, transportation, and other service industries. The vast majority of the research is undertaken using primary data and few studies used secondary ESG data sourced by national or third-party institutions. The articles were classified into six broad thematic categories and multiple sub-categories such as (1) energy efficiency; (2) water conversation; (3) green supply chain management; (4) waste management; (5) product/ service eco- friendliness; and (6) emissions reduction.
   3.2 Study Implications
   Based on the thematic clustering undertaken, we developed an integrative framework for environmental marketing and management practices and a coherent agenda for future research directions. The systematic review confirms that managers might adopt environmentally friendly marketing/ management strategy as a means of increasing their performance. Competences such knowledge, systems and routines developed within the company are found to stimulate a proactive environmental strategy which research has shown that can enhance different performance outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundDrainage activities have caused widespread wetland loss, groundwater drawdown and impairment of ecosystem services. There are now several national programs for wetland restoration, primarily focused on reintroducing ecosystem services such as habitats and nutrient retention. In Sweden, recent dry summers have also reinforced interest in hydrological functions such as the potential for enhanced groundwater storage, both in and around the wetland. However, there are several knowledge gaps regarding groundwater storage effects of restoration, including if they extend beyond the wetland and how they vary with local conditions. Therefore, we have systematically reviewed groundwater storage effects from the interventions of restoring, constructing or draining boreo-temperate wetlands. Drainage was included primarily to evaluate to what degree restoration can reverse drainage effects. MethodsWe searched 8 databases for scientific journal publications in English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, French, German and Polish. Gray literature was searched in English and Swedish. Articles were included based on their relevance for Swedish conditions, i.e., in previously glaciated areas with boreal or temperate climate. Extracted outcome data were groundwater level changes, along with other variables including type of wetland and intervention and, when reported, distance between sampling point and intervention. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for studies that reported groundwater levels at different distances and studies that reported overall effects. Included studies were subject to critical appraisal to evaluate their susceptibility to bias, primarily selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias. Critical appraisal results were used in sensitivity analysis. Review findingsOut of 11,288 screened records, 224 articles fulfilled the criteria, and from these, 146 studies were included in meta-analysis. Most studies (89%) investigated peatlands, primarily from Finland, the UK and Canada. Restoration and drainage studies were equally common. Only nine studies reported measurements beyond the wetland area. Our synthesis is therefore primarily focused on effects within wetlands. In peatland restoration, the observed groundwater level rise decreased exponentially with distance from the restored ditch and was reduced to 50% after 9 [95% confidence interval: 5, 26] m. Drainage reached somewhat farther, with 50% of the groundwater drawdown remaining at 21 [11, 64] m. On average, restoration increased groundwater levels by 22 [16, 28] cm near the intervention, whereas drainage caused a drawdown of 19 [10, 27] cm. Assuming that sampling was unbiased, effects were similar for bogs, fens and mires. Restricting the meta-analysis to the 58% of studies that were of high validity did not alter conclusions. ConclusionsEffects of peatland restoration and drainage were of similar magnitudes but opposite directions. This indicates that, on average, rewetting of drained peatlands can be expected to restore groundwater levels near the ditch. However, restoration may not reach all the area affected by drainage, and there was a strong dependence on local context. For managers of wetland projects, it is thus important to follow up and monitor restoration effects and reinforce the intervention if necessary. Our results also point to a need for better impact evaluation if increased storage beyond the restored wetland area is desired.

AB  - Bicycling for transportation improves health, reduces pollution and congestion, and produces economic rewards for communities. This paper presents a targeted update and appraisal of the current literature on the factors that influence bicycling for transportation. This is a systematic literature review. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed research published in English that reported on qualitative or quantitative findings. Studies were included if they reported on: (1) adults, (2) presented findings that were specific to bicycling for transportation (separate from walking, or overall active transport, or commuting), (3) were cross-sectional or observational (not experimental), and (4) examined the influences on bicycling behavior. Following a final manual review by the authors, 102 (out of an original 773) studies met the search criteria. The findings are organized using the ecological model as a framework. At the individual level, the research identified demographic characteristics, health and physical activity, and psychological factors as significant influences on transportation bicycling, but these factors might be closely related to the context. At the social and cultural level, limited available studies found that community norms and social support were significant, although these constructs lacked consistent definitions. At the environmental level, numerous aspects of the built and natural environment (in a range of scales) were identified as significant, but raised questions of scale and potential interactions with other levels of the ecological model. There is extensive literature on factors that influence transportation bicycling; however, future research is required that simultaneously considers multiple influences at multiple levels, via multiple potential pathways. For communities that want to increase transportation bicycling with specific interventions, maximizing their impact will depend on understanding the individual, social, and physical contexts to determine the most appropriate approach.

AB  - Free-ranging wild vertebrates need to cope with natural and anthropogenic stressors that cause short and/or long-term behavioural and physiological responses. In areas of high human disturbance, the use of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones as biomarkers to measure stress responses is an increasingly common tool for understanding how animals cope with human disturbance. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate how human disturbances such as habitat conversion, habitat degradation, and ecotourism influence baseline GC hormones of free-ranging wild vertebrates, and we further test the role of protected areas in reducing the impact of such disturbances on these hormones. A total of 58 studies met the inclusion criteria, providing 152 data points for comparing levels of GC hormones under disturbed and undisturbed conditions. The overall effect size suggests that human disturbance does not cause a consistent increase in levels of GC hormones (Hedges' g = 0.307, 95% CI = -0.062 to 0.677). However, when the data were analysed by disturbance type, living in unprotected areas or in areas with habitat conversion were found to increase GC hormone levels compared to living in protected or undisturbed areas. By contrast, we found no evidence that ecotourism or habitat degradation generates a consistent increase in baseline GC hormone levels. Among taxonomic groups, mammals appeared more sensitive to human disturbance than birds. We advocate the use of GC hormones for inferring major human-caused contributors to the stress levels of free-ranging wild vertebrates - although such information needs to be combined with other measures of stress and interpreted in the context of an organism's life history, behaviour, and history of interactions with human disturbance.

AB  - Agricultural policies play a crucial part in any economy, Sustainable agriculture policy ensure food safety and socio-economic development but also vary considerably across the various regions of the world, A comparative policy analysis helps to determine various positive and negative factors which can help and promote the implementation of sustainable agriculture policies for future. This article compares three Indian states and one German bio village in terms of their policy. This study uses a systematic literature review of 72 published Journal articles indexed in reputed databases to first identify the key drivers, enablers, and bottlenecks and subsequently, in terms of these, compares agricultural policies of the three best performing states in India (Punjab, Gujarat, Sikkim) and bio-village Juhnde (Germany). NVivo software is used for the content analysis to check the word frequency and relevancy of the research done, ranking of these states, and bio-village extends key takeaway for crafting effective and efficient agricultural policies that can be replicated in other regions. Indian states of Punjab and Gujarat are still lagging in terms of sustainable agricultural policies, exploitation of natural resources is the main concern in both the two states, issues such as low groundwater table and excessive use of chemical fertilizers are still the main bottlenecks for Punjab and Gujarat province. Secondly, the Indian north-eastern state Sikkim has shown the world how the best policies can promote socioeconomic development in any region, the state government of Sikkim has worked as an enabler for the agriculture sector. Germany's first bio village has paved the way to the other German villages, Juhnde village has set an example for other villages and provinces to install bioenergy plants.

AB  - Roads have numerous direct and indirect ecological impacts on wildlife. Vehicle collisions are a top impact of roads on birds, with tens of millions of birds thought to be killed each year in the United States. However, currently available mortality estimates are extrapolated from a single study. We reviewed the literature and used 20 mortality rates extracted from 13 studies to systematically quantify data-driven estimates of annual U.S. mortality from bird-vehicle collisions. We generated 4 separate estimates along with uncertainty using different subsets of data deemed to be rigorous enough to contribute relatively little bias to estimates. All of our estimates of vehicle mortality are higher than previous U.S. figures. When averaging across model iterations, we estimated that between 89 and 340 million birds die annually from vehicle collisions on U.S. roads. Sensitivity analyses indicated that uncertainty about survey-related biases (scavenger removal and searcher detection of carcasses) contributes the greatest amount of uncertainty to our mortality estimates. Future studies should account for these biases to provide more accurate local estimates of mortality rates and to inform more precise national mortality estimates. We found relatively little information available to quantify regional, seasonal, and taxonomic patterns of vehicle collision risk, and substantial uncertainty remains about whether collisions contribute to large-scale impacts on bird populations. Nonetheless, the large magnitude of bird mortality caused by vehicle collisions combined with evidence that collisions can contribute to local population declines for some species highlights the need for implementation of conservation and management actions to reduce this mortality.

AB  - Roads are a potential threat to bat conservation. In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats - notably woodland - was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.

AB  - Background
   With an estimated 27 million annual incidents of maternal morbidity globally, how they are manifested or experienced is diverse and shaped by societal, cultural and personal influences. Using qualitative research to examine a woman's perception of her pregnancy, its complications, and potential long-term impact on her life can inform public health approaches and complement and inform biomedical classifications of maternal morbidities, historically considered a neglected dimension of safe motherhood. As part of the WHO's Maternal Morbidity Working Group's efforts to define and measure maternal morbidity, we carried out a thematic analysis of the qualitative literature published between 1998 and 2017 on how women experience maternal morbidity in low and lower-middle income countries.
   Results and conclusions
   Analysis of the 71 papers included in this study shows that women's status, their marital relationships, cultural attitudes towards fertility and social responses to infertility and pregnancy trauma are fundamental to determining how they will experience morbidity in the pregnancy and postpartum periods. We explore the physical, economic, psychological and social repercussions pregnancy can produce for women, and how resource disadvantage (systemic, financial and contextual) can exacerbate these problems. In addition to an analysis of ten themes that emerged across the different contexts, this paper presents which morbidities have received attention in different regions and the trends in researching morbidities over time. We observed an increase in qualitative research on this topic, generally undertaken through interviews and focus groups. Our analysis calls for the pursuit of high quality qualitative research that includes repeat interviews, participant observation and triangulation of sources to inform and fuel critical advocacy and programmatic work on maternal morbidities that addresses their prevention and management, as well as the underlying systemic problems for women's status in society.

AB  - Introduction: Community-supported agriculture (CSA) offers a high potential to provide synergies between ecological, economic and social sustainability aspects. While CSA is still in a niche, it has experienced rapid growth and increasing interest during the last years. An overview of sustainability impacts of CSA based on quantitative empirical work is missing, which is needed for well-informed and targeted policies and funding, as well as to tackle research gaps.Methods: Here we reviewed the literature to systematically assess empirical and quantitative findings regarding sustainability outcomes of CSA at different levels.Results: We found that < 30% of the 39 studies included assessed ecological sustainability aspects. If CSA farms were compared to reference systems, they mostly performed better with regard to resource use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of studies evaluated social aspects. While many studies showed that CSA yet fails to reach low-income households, and therefore members do not represent the average population, CSA membership improves health and sustainability behavior. Economic variables were assessed in more than half of the considered studies, but knowledge on the relative performance remains scarce. Nevertheless, first studies indicate high economic viability.Discussion: Our review suggests a largely positive performance of CSA with regard to sustainability. Accordingly, if CSA would reach a bigger share in the food system, it could contribute to a transformation toward sustainable food systems. To address important knowledge gaps, we recommend the consideration of more and particularly ecological sustainability aspects, comparisons across different farming and marketing systems and the integration of knowledge from different sources such as theses and practical knowledge documented in various languages in different parts of the world.

AB  - With increasing cultural and linguistic diversity in today's classrooms, a growing body of research continues to explore the varied ways in which digital tools and multiple modalities can tap into emergent bilingual students' academic and linguistic strengths. To understand the empirical landscape of this growing research, the authors systematically reviewed the literature on emergent bilinguals and digital multimodal composition in secondary classrooms. Through an inductive approach, the authors analyzed 70 studies to understand key findings and characteristics of the extant research. Five main themes of findings emerged across the research. First, a majority of studies illustrated how digital multimodal composing supports emergent bilingual students' identity expression. With expanded opportunities to share ideas through multiple modes, students used their projects to bridge transnational identities, (re)present themselves, and communicate in empowering ways. Second, nearly half of the studies emphasized how the integration of digital multimodal projects can reshape classrooms by challenging language ideologies, transforming the classroom as a locus for social justice, and expanding temporal and spatial boundaries as students compose for multiple audiences. Third, many studies demonstrated how emergent bilinguals develop as designers and leverage the unique semiotic resources of multiple modes when composing. Fourth, approximately a third of the studies showed how multimodal composition offers emergent bilinguals opportunities to expand their existing linguistic repertoires. Finally, a quarter of the studies illustrated the potential of multiple modes to mediate learning during composing processes. The authors discuss the implications of these themes and critical new directions for future research on digital multimodal composing with emergent bilingual students.

AB  - Precast concrete buildings (PCB) offer several advantages, including swift construction, exceptional quality, enhanced durability, decreased formwork requirements, and reduced labour. However, it is crucial to effectively study the connections between the various prefabricated elements that make up the structure, particularly in the face of dynamic loads and seismic actions. Extensive research has been conducted to develop seismic-resistant PCB, underscoring the necessity of exploring research approaches, identifying trends, addressing gaps, and outlining future research directions. A thorough analysis was carried out on a literature set comprising 127 articles published between 2012 and May 2023, using a three-step research process that included bibliometric search, quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis. The primary objective was to identify prevailing research trends and pinpoint current gaps that would contribute to the advancement of future research. The scientific mapping of authors' keywords revealed the correlation between PCB and topics such as dry connections, energy dissipation, optimal design, and progressive collapse, highlighting the diverse nature of current research in the field. Furthermore, the qualitative literature analysis demonstrated that frame and shear wall systems emerged as the predominant categories. This dominance can be attributed to the seismic performance reference being the traditional cast-in-place building approach. Nonetheless, this study brings attention to several notable research gaps. These gaps include the necessity to explore innovative, resilient structural systems in greater detail and the requirement for adopting state-of-the-art methodologies that facilitate decision-making processes in integrating PCB seismic safety and sustainability. This study provides a roadmap for future research projects and reports on the latest developments and trends in seismically safe PCB research.

AB  - A supply chain consists of many stakeholders such as suppliers, carriers and customers. It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a "one trusted ledger" that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our findings, one potential impact of deploying blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain can obtain verified information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research, we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conflict of interests. Future work such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying this technology within a supply chain. Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain.

AB  - Agricultural water requirements differ between foods. Population-level dietary preferences are therefore a major determinant of agricultural water use. The "water footprint" (WF) represents the volume of water consumed in the production of food items, separated by water source; blue WF represents ground and surface water use, and green WF represents rain water use. We systematically searched for published studies using the WF to assess the water use of diets. We used the available evidence to quantify the WF of diets in different countries, and grouped diets in patterns according to study definition. "Average" patterns equated to those currently consumed, whereas "healthy" patterns included those recommended in national dietary guidelines. We searched 7 online databases and identified 41 eligible studies that reported the dietary green WF, blueWF, or total WF (green plus blue) (1964 estimates for 176 countries). The available evidence suggests that, on average, European (170 estimates) and Oceanian (18 estimates) dietary patterns have the highest green WFs (median per capita: 2999 L/d and 2924 L/d, respectively), whereas Asian dietary patterns (98 estimates) have the highest blue WFs (median: 382 L/d per capita). Foods of animal origin are major contributors to the green WFs of diets, whereas cereals, fruits, nuts, and oils are major contributors to the blue WF of diets. "Healthy" dietary patterns (425 estimates) had green WFs that were 5.9% (95% CI: -7.7, -4.0) lower than those of "average" dietary patterns, but they did not differ in their blue WFs. Our review suggests that changes toward healthier diets could reduce totalwater use of agriculture, butwould not affect bluewater use. Rapid dietary change and increasing water security concerns underscore the need for a better understanding of the amount and type of water used in food production to make informed policy decisions.

AB  - Rapid climate change occurring in the Arctic may affect the diet of ecologically and culturally important northern fish species. Here, a systematic literature review was completed for eight fish species found across the North American Arctic, with a focus on Inuit Nunangat, to identify major prey items, summarize feeding strategies, and highlight data gaps. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden Char (Salvelinus malma), Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus), and Burbot (Lota lota), were selected as species of interest due to their ecological and cultural importance. The 74 studies reviewed indicate that these species are generalist feeders that demonstrate wide dietary niches, as well as the tendency to avoid agonistic interactions by partitioning resources when they co-occur with an overlapping species. Across coastal, lacustrine, and riverine systems, the most commonly consumed prey items are insects (Diptera spp.), as well as benthic forage fishes such as sculpins (Family: Cottidae). Insects are major prey items in riverine systems, where diets appear to be more generalized, compared to lakes. Anadromous species in coastal waters most commonly feed on various crustaceans and forage fishes. Benthic forage fishes, insects, zooplankton, and mollusks are widely consumed prey items in Arctic lakes. Burbot, Inconnu, and resident Dolly Varden had the most specialized feeding strategies, due in part to their habitat requirements and morphology, while Lake Trout and resident Arctic Char often form multiple ecotypes in lakes, some with different feeding behaviors. Knowledge gaps regarding northern fish trophic ecology are highlighted, and in particular include riverine systems and winter foraging behavior. This review is intended to inform predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on fish tropic ecology and to guide future research.

AB  - Nowadays, companies, governments, and designers are concerned about the environmental impact derived from the development of new products. In light of this trend, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) is gaining relevance since CE enables a set of strategies to avoid and reduce resource consumption, energy, and emissions derived from transforming raw material into functional products. These strategies also imply extending product lifespan, keeping their value as long as possible, and closing the loop of materials involved in such products. Future engineers will face the CE model, which involves a radical shift from the current linear model based on throw-away practices. Therefore, there is a need to educate professionals with knowledge in the topic and advance the research in the field. However, CE has not been yet globally introduced in the engineering curriculum in many parts of the world, and the research in the field has also been limited. CE has not been widely adopted yet as a strategy for the sustainable development of new products. Consequently, this article reviews and summarizes the research work and some implementation initiatives on CE in learning activities for engineering students during the last 10 years following a systematic approach.
   Results of the study provide a broad viewpoint in terms of where the research work is taking place and the means of disseminating the results. Additionally, an analysis based on the content reflects the methodological approaches used to introduce CE in the curriculum. Finally, the literature review also identifies the focus areas of the CE research and the emphasis during the lifecycle of the products. This work also reflects on some challenges for implementing CE in the engineering curriculum. The analysis presented in this article serves as a keystone for educators, lecturers, and researchers in engineering education to include and implement CE strategies and methodological tools in the curriculum of engineering and advance the research work in this area.

AB  - Background In recent years, more than 120 million people each year have needed urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Armed conflict has profoundly negative consequences in communities. Destruction of civilian infrastructure impacts access to basic health services and complicates widespread emergency responses. The number of conflicts occurring is increasing, lasting longer and affecting more people today than a decade ago. The number of children living in conflict zones has been steadily increasing since the year 2000, increasing the need for health services and resources. This review systematically synthesised the indexed and grey literature reporting on the delivery of trauma and rehabilitation interventions for conflict-affected populations.
   Methods A systematic search of literature published from 1 January 1990 to 31 March 2018 was conducted across several databases. Eligible publications reported on women and children in low and middle-income countries. Included publications provided information on the delivery of interventions for trauma, sustained injuries or rehabilitation in conflict-affected populations.
   Results A total of 81 publications met the inclusion criteria, and were included in our review. Nearly all of the included publications were observational in nature, employing retrospective chart reviews of surgical procedures delivered in a hospital setting to conflict-affected individuals. The majority of publications reported injuries due to explosive devices and remnants of war. Injuries requiring orthopaedic/reconstructive surgeries were the most commonly reported interventions. Barriers to health services centred on the distance and availability from the site of injury to health facilities.
   Conclusions Traumatic injuries require an array of medical and surgical interventions, and their effective treatment largely depends on prompt and timely management and referral, with appropriate rehabilitation services and post-treatment follow-up. Further work to evaluate intervention delivery in this domain is needed, particularly among children given their specialised needs, and in different population displacement contexts.

AB  - Despite expanding urban areas and increased awareness of urbanization impacts on wildlife, trends in urban wildlife studies have not been evaluated systematically. We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The palm oil industry has emerged as one of the leading producers and exporters, as supported by data from the Central Bureau of Statistics in 2021, which indicates that Indonesian palm oil exports reached an impressive value of USD 18.44 billion, or IDR 258 trillion, in 2020, marking 18.43 percent growth compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the domestic markets for palm oil and palm kernel oil remain substantial despite improvements in export quantities. Various industries, including cooking oil refineries, specialty fats, shortening, margarine, bath soaps, and oleochemicals, present potential markets for palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). The palm oil industry encompasses four related subsectors, namely growers, millers, refiners, and oleochemicals, forming an integrated value chain from upstream to downstream. The current focus on environmental, economic, and social sustainability drives companies to adopt internal green activities and expand their efforts toward sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Implementing SSCM practices is often seen as economically beneficial, as research has demonstrated their positive impact on corporate performance from a resource perspective. Many green management applications are utilized in the palm oil industry. This study examines and highlights existing sustainable management practices across the entire palm oil supply chain, focusing on producing high-quality palm oil. This study utilized a systematic review methodology. A total of 62 articles were analyzed, which involved an extensive review of the relevant literature to identify research trends, gaps, and issues. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by expanding the theory of organizational readiness to prepare globally competitive palm oil products. The research findings hold practical significance for practitioners and academics by providing a comprehensive road map for implementing green management applications at the organizational level in the palm oil industry's upstream-to-downstream chain.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of life cycle assessment publications performed on primary pig production, defining their functional unit as "mass of pig live-weight". After the initial search in Scopus and Web of Science, a four-step screening process for eliminating results out of scope was applied, resulting in a total of seventy-four (74) studies. The publication years ranged between the years 2005 and 2023, with assessments conducted across twenty-seven (27) countries. Reported impact potentials for climate change, acidification, eutrophication, land-, water-, and energy use are presented and discussed in individual sections. Contribution to climate change was primarily attributed to feed production, animal housing and manure management. Climate change impacts ranged from-0.02 to 11.2 kg CO2-eq per kg pig live weight excluding land use changes. Inclusion of direct land use change was reported to increase the climate change impact up to 470 %. Substantial differences of climate change impacts were observed in studies including production from multiple countries. A reduction of 31-37 % of the climate change impact per kg of pig live weight was reported on national levels over the last two decades. Feed changes resulted in reductions of up to 35 % to the climate change impacts, although more commonly below 20 %. Manure management systems and housing of animals were commonly compared in conjunction with multiple systematic changes in conventional and organic production. Incorporation of anaerobic digestion and biogas production was consistently reported beneficial, achieving reduction in climate change impacts of up to 64 % through substitution of energy or natural gas. Substantial impact mitigation will most likely be achieved through a wide selection of improvements including breed selection, animal feed, animal housing and manure management system changes. Issues relating to assessment approach/method and modelling choices are discussed, as their heterogeneity presents a limitation in terms of comparability of assessment results.

AB  - Solid waste generation and its impact on human health and the environment have long been a matter of concern for governments across the world. In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on resource recovery (reusing, recycling and extracting energy from waste) using more advanced approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) in Australia. AI is a powerful technology that is increasingly gaining popularity and application in various fields. The adoption of AI techniques offers alternative innovative approaches to solid waste management (SWM). Although there are previous studies on AI technologies and SWM, no study has assessed the adoption of AI applications in solving the diverse SWM problems for achieving sustainable waste management in Australia. Moreover, there are inconsistencies and a lack of awareness on how AI technologies function in relation to their application to SWM. This study examines the application of AI technologies in various areas of SWM (generation, sorting, collection, vehicle routing, treatment, disposal and waste management planning) to enhance sustainable waste management practices in Australia. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2005 to 2021 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the adoption of AI applications on SWM, compares the performance of AI applications, explores the benefits and challenges, and provides best practice recommendations on how resource efficiency can be optimized to improve economic, environmental and social outcomes. This study found that AI-based models have better prediction abilities when compared to other models used in forecasting solid waste generation and recycling. Findings show that waste generation in Australia has been steadily increasing and requires upgraded and improved recovery infrastructure and the appropriate adoption of AI technologies to enhance sustainable SWM. Australia's adoption of AI recycling technologies would benefit from a national approach that seeks consistency across jurisdictions, while catering for regional differences. This study will benefit researchers, governments, policy-makers, municipalities and other waste management organizations to increase current recycling rates, eliminate the need for manual labor, reduce costs, maximize efficiency, and transform the way we approach the management of solid waste.

AB  - Augmented reality has emerged as a transformative technology, with the potential to revolutionize the tourism industry. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of studies tracing the progression of AR and its application in tourism, from early exploration to recent advancements. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution, contexts, and design elements of AR in tourism over the period (2002-2022), offering insights for further progress in this domain. Employing a dual-method approach, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on 861 articles collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, to investigate the evolution of AR research over time and across countries, and to identify the main contexts of the utilization of AR in tourism. In the second part of our study, a systematic content analysis was conducted, focusing on a subset of 57 selected studies that specifically employed AR systems in various tourism situations. Through this analysis, the most commonly utilized AR design components, such as tracking systems, AR devices, tourism settings, and virtual content were summarized. Furthermore, we explored how these components were integrated to enhance the overall tourism experience. The findings reveal a growing trend in research production, led by Europe and Asia. Key contexts of AR applications in tourism encompass cultural heritage, mobile AR, and smart tourism, with emerging topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and COVID-19. Frequently used AR design components comprise mobile devices, marker-less tracking systems, outdoor environments, and visual overlays. Future research could involve optimizing AR experiences for users with disabilities, supporting multicultural experiences, integrating AI with big data, fostering sustainability, and remote virtual tourism. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of AR in shaping the future of tourism in the post COVID-19 era, by providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in the tourism industry.

AB  - In recent years, the Industry 4.0 concept has gained considerable attention from professionals, researchers and decision makers. For its part, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of managing the agri-food supply chain to ensure the food that the population needs. Industry 4.0 and its extensions can address the needs of the agri-food supply chain by bringing new features such as security, transparency and traceability in line with sustainable development goals. This study aims to systematically analyze the literature to address the challenges and barriers against the application of industry 4.0 and its related technologies in the management of an agri-food supply chain. Currently, despite the large number of publications, there is no clear agreement on what Industry 4.0 is, and even less its extensions. The next revolution that includes new technologies and improves several existing technologies brings additional conceptual and practical complexity. Consequently, in this work we first determine the main components of I 4.0 and their extensions by studying the literature, and then, in the second step, define the agri-food supply chain on which I 4.0 technologies are applied. Two well-known databases-Web of Science and Scopus-were chosen to extract data for the systematic review of the literature. For the final evaluation, we identified 24 of 100 reviewed publications. The results provide an exhaustive analysis of the different I 4.0 technologies and their extensions that are applied in regards to the agri-food supply chain. In addition, we find 15 challenges that are classified into five major themes in the agri-food supply chain: technical, operational, financial, social and infrastructure. The four most important challenges identified are technological architecture, security and privacy, big data management and IoT (internet)-based infrastructure. Only a few articles addressed sustainability, which reaffirms and demonstrates a considerable gap in terms of the sustainable agri-food supply chain, with waste management being the one that has attracted the most attention. This review provides a roadmap for academics and practitioners alike, showing the gaps and facilitating the identification of I 4.0 technologies that can help address the challenges facing the efficient management of an agri-food supply chain.

AB  - Purpose -The research paper aims to analyse the scholarly literature on advancing HR analytics as an intervention for attrition, a problem that lingers on organisational performance. This study aspires to provide an in-depth literature review and critically assess the knowledge gaps in HR analytics and attritions within organisational performance.Design/methodology/approach- The review analyses the corpus of 196 research articles published in ostensible journals between 2011 and 2023. To identify research gaps and provide valuable insights, this study synthesises relevant studies using School of thought (S), Context (C), Methodology (M), Triggers (T), Barriers (B), Facilitators (F) and Outcomes (O) (SCM-TBFO framework). This study employs the R programming language to conduct a systematic literature review in accordance with the "preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis" (PRISMA) guidelines.Findings- The emerging discipline of HR analytics encompasses the potential to manage attrition and drive organisational performance enhancements effectively. The study of SCM-TBFO encompasses a multidimensional approach, incorporating diverse perspectives and analysing its complex aspects compared to various approaches. The School of thought includes the human capital theory, expectancy theory and resource-based view. The varied research contexts entail the USA, United Kingdom, China, France, Italy and India. Further, the methodologies adopted in the studies are artificial neural networking (ANN), regression, structure equation modelling (SEM) case studies and other theoretical studies. HR analytics and attrition triggers are data mining decision systems, forecasting for firm performance and employee satisfaction. The barriers include leadership styles, cultural adaptability and lack of analytic skills, data security and organisational orientation. The facilitators were categorised into data and technology-related facilitators, human resource policies and organisational growth and performance-related facilitators. The study's primary outcomes are technology adoption, effective HR policies, HR strategies, employee satisfaction, career and organisational expansion and growth.Originality/value- The primary goal of the literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of HR analytics and its impact on organisational performance, particularly in relation to attrition. Further, the study suggests that attrition, a critical organisational concern, can be effectively managed by strategically utilising HR analytics and empowering data-driven interventions that optimise performance and enhance overall organisational outcomes.

AB  - Research Question/Issues: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of all scholarly publications in the field of corporate governance (CG) since the Enron scandal of 2001. Using bibliometric methods, we identify prominent themes that have served as the foundation of CG research, prominent topics in the field along with their temporal developments, and recent trends in CG research. In addition, we identify the authors and journals that have had the biggest impact in the field.
   Research Findings/Insights: We document that the number of annual publications in CG has increased by a factor of eight since the early 2000s, with research articles being published in a wide variety of general interest journals, as well as in outlets specialized in the field of CG. We identify six research themes as the foundation of CG research: the theoretical foundations of CG, ownership, CG mechanisms and firm outcomes, disclosures, the board of directors, and family firms. We further find 19 major bibliographic keyword clusters that have been explored by researchers in the past 20 years. Research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability, governance mechanisms, control mechanisms and disclosures, board diversity, CG in family firms, and CG in the Chinese context are the most dynamic areas of research in recent years.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications: We systematically analyze the literature on CG and outline theoretical foundations, structuring academic contributions by keyword clusters. Links between keyword clusters as well as the most dynamic research areas are identified. The analysis provides guidance for researchers regarding suitable outlets for the different thematic clusters and helps as a basis to identify research opportunities.
   Practitioner/Policy Implications: We document growing research interest in the field of CSR and sustainability. The growing body of literature in these areas can inform CG and CSR policies in the future. Our comprehensive bibliographic analysis provides an overview of CG research themes across research disciplines and streams of the literature.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement Enset is a staple food for over 20 million people via its starch-rich corm and pseudostem, yet it is virtually unknown outside a narrow zone of cultivation in southern Ethiopia. Due to acculturation and urbanization coupled with climate change, emerging pests and the introduction of new crops, the extensive indigenous knowledge associated with this crop is in danger of being lost, imperilling the future food security and prosperity of millions of Ethiopians. Here, we synthesize the current state of enset ethnobotanical research, identifying key gaps and challenges, and provide a framework for further enset research to safeguard this important, but neglected, tropical crop.
   Summary
   Enset (Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman) is the major starch staple of the Ethiopian Highlands, where its unique attributes enhance the food security of approximately 20 million people and have earned it the title "The Tree Against Hunger". Yet enset-based agriculture is virtually unknown outside of its narrow zone of cultivation, despite growing wild across much of East and Southern Africa. Here, we review historical production data to show that the area of land under enset production in Ethiopia has reportedly increased 46% in two decades, whilst yield increased 12-fold over the same period, making enset the second most produced crop species in Ethiopia-though we critically evaluate potential issues with these data. Furthermore, we address a major challenge in the development and wider cultivation of enset, by reviewing and synthesizing the complex and fragmented agronomic and ethnobotanic knowledge associated with this species; including farming systems, processing methods, products, medicinal uses and cultural importance. Finally, we provide a framework to improve the quality, consistency and comparability of data collected across culturally diverse enset-based agricultural systems to enhanced sustainable use of this neglected starch staple. In conclusion, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for enset cultivation beyond its restricted distribution, and the regional food security potential it could afford smallholders elsewhere in Southern and East Africa.

AB  - Purpose - Despite the increased adoption and reported benefits of kaizen event (KE) programs, there is a lack of empirical research documenting their design, implementation and outcomes, as well as what designs may be more vs less effective. This paper aims to present an empirical study describing the characteristics, including outcomes achieved, program attributes, and implementation problems, of 16 established ICE programs. Although this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, the goal is to identify areas for future research, including attributes that appear to support or detract from program success, and the outcomes and implementation problems experienced.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using semi-structured interviews, qualitative data were collected to characterize established KE programs in 16 manufacturing, service, and government organizations. The data were examined using content analysis to identify the most frequent codes for each characteristic, which were then compared to ICE program characteristics synthesized from a systematic review of published KE sources. Based on this, a set of propositions were identified to guide future research on KE programs.
   Findings - The majority of the 16 organizations reported successful programs, although there was noted variation in organization success. The organizations also neglected to measure many aspects of program success which they considered to be highly important, in particular, human resource outcomes. In addition, the organizations appeared to struggle with sustainability and believe that sustainability problems could threaten long-term KE program viability. Other potentially influential factors include the types of processes targeted, event types, catalysts for events, and KE resources. The findings were used to develop propositions for future research in these and other specific areas.
   Practical implications - The study provides a better understanding of the characteristics of established KE programs, as well as common areas in need of improvement even in these programs, and can be used by practitioners in establishing or improving their KE programs.
   Originality/value - By documenting established KE programs across organizations and comparing actual practices to published sources, this study contributes to the development of KE theory and also provides direction for future empirical research.

AB  - Background: This is the eighth in a series of papers reporting Sustainability in Health care by Allocating Resources Effectively (SHARE) in a local healthcare setting. The SHARE Program was a systematic, integrated, evidence-based program for disinvestment within a large Australian health service. One of the aims was to explore methods to deliver existing high quality synthesised evidence directly to decision-makers to drive decision-making proactively. An Evidence Dissemination Service (EDS) was proposed. While this was conceived as a method to identify disinvestment opportunities, it became clear that it could also be a way to review all practices for consistency with current evidence. This paper reports the development, implementation and evaluation of two models of an in-house EDS.
   Methods: Frameworks for development of complex interventions, implementation of evidence-based change, and evaluation and explication of processes and outcomes were adapted and/or applied. Mixed methods including a literature review, surveys, interviews, workshops, audits, document analysis and action research were used to capture barriers, enablers and local needs; identify effective strategies; develop and refine proposals; ascertain feedback and measure outcomes.
   Results: Methods to identify, capture, classify, store, repackage, disseminate and facilitate use of synthesised research evidence were investigated. In Model 1, emails containing links to multiple publications were sent to all self-selected participants who were asked to determine whether they were the relevant decision-maker for any of the topics presented, whether change was required, and to take the relevant action. This voluntary framework did not achieve the aim of ensuring practice was consistent with current evidence. In Model 2, the need for change was established prior to dissemination, then a summary of the evidence was sent to the decision-maker responsible for practice in the relevant area who was required to take appropriate action and report the outcome. This mandatory governance framework was successful. The factors influencing decisions, processes and outcomes were identified.
   Conclusion: An in-house EDS holds promise as a method of identifying disinvestment opportunities and/or reviewing local practice for consistency with current evidence. The resource-intensive nature of delivery of the EDS is a potential barrier. The findings from this study will inform further exploration.

AB  - Dioxins have been an inconvenience to the Baltic Sea ecosystem for decades. Although the concentrations in the environment and biota have continuously decreased, dioxins still pose a risk to human health. The risk and its formation vary in different parts of the Baltic Sea, due to variability in the environmental and societal factors affecting it. This paper presents a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis about the regional dioxin risk formation in four sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and evaluates, whether systemic approach changes our thinking about the risk and its effective management. We studied the dioxin flux from atmospheric deposition to the Baltic Sea food webs, accumulation to two commercially and culturally important fish species, Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) and Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), and further to risk group members of four Baltic countries. Based on 46 studies, we identified 20 quantifiable variables and indexed them for commensurable regional comparison. Spatial differences in dioxin pollution, environmental conditions, food web dynamics, and the following dioxin concentrations in herring and salmon, together with fishing and fish consumption, affect how the final health risk builds up. In the southern Baltic Sea, atmospheric pollution levels are relatively high and environmental processes to decrease bioavailability of dioxins unfavorable, but the growth is fast, which curb the bioaccumulation of dioxins in the biota. In the North, long-range atmospheric pollution is minor compared to South, but the local pollution and slower growth leads to higher bioaccumulation rates. However, based on our results, the most remarkable differences in the dioxin risk formation between the areas arise from the social sphere: the emissions, origin of national catches, and cultural differences in fish consumption.

AB  - Artificial refuges are human-made structures that aim to create safe places for animals to breed, hibernate, or take shelter in lieu of natural refuges. Artificial refuges are used across the globe to mitigate the impacts of a variety of threats on wildlife, such as habitat loss and degradation. However, there is little understanding of the science underpinning artificial refuges, and what comprises best practice for artificial refuge design and implementation for wildlife conservation. We address this gap by undertaking a systematic review of the current state of artificial refuge research for the conservation of wildlife. We identified 224 studies of artificial refuges being implemented in the field to conserve wildlife species. The current literature on artificial refuges is dominated by studies of arboreal species, primarily birds and bats. Threatening processes addressed by artificial refuges were biological resource use (26%), invasive or problematic species (20%), and agriculture (15%), yet few studies examined artificial refuges specifically for threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) species (7%). Studies often reported the characteristics of artificial refuges (i.e. refuge size, construction materials; 87%) and surrounding vegetation (35%), but fewer studies measured the thermal properties of artificial refuges (18%), predator activity (17%), or food availability (3%). Almost all studies measured occupancy of the artificial refuges by target species (98%), and over half measured breeding activity (54%), whereas fewer included more detailed measures of fitness, such as breeding productivity (34%) or animal body condition (4%). Evaluating the benefits and impacts of artificial refuges requires sound experimental design, but only 39% of studies compared artificial refuges to experimental controls, and only 10% of studies used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. As a consequence, few studies of artificial refuges can determine their overall effect on individuals or populations. We outline a series of key steps in the design, implementation, and monitoring of artificial refuges that are required to avoid perverse outcomes and maximise the chances of achieving conservation objectives. This review highlights a clear need for increased rigour in studies of artificial refuges if they are to play an important role in wildlife conservation.

AB  - To tackle the alarming increase in e-waste or end-of-life (EoL) electronic products, consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied. End users or consumers are the starting point where ewaste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy (CE), such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household waste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers' e-waste-related knowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into the CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international peer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers' disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research.

AB  - Biodiversity is already experiencing the effects of climate change through range expansion, retraction, or relocation, potentializing negative effects of other threats. Future projections already indicate richness reduction and composition modifications of bird communities due to global warming, which may disrupt the provision of key ecological services to ecosystem maintenance. Here, we systematically review the effect of morphological, ecological, and geographical traits on the amount of future suitable area for birds worldwide. Specifically, we tested whether body mass, diet, habitat type, movement pattern, range size, and biogeographic realm affect birds' suitable area. Our search returned 75 studies that modeled the effects of climate change on 1,991 bird species. Our analyses included 1,661 species belonging to 128 families, representing 83% of the total, for which we were able to acquire all the six traits. The proportion of birds' suitable area was affected by range size, body mass, habitat type, and biogeographic realm, while diet and movement pattern showed lower relative importance and were not included in our final model. Contrary to expectations, the proportion of birds' suitable area was negatively related to range size, which may be explained by higher climatic stability predicted in certain areas that harbor species with restricted distribution. In contrast, we observed that birds presenting higher body mass will show an increase of the proportion of suitable area in the future. This is expected due to the high exposure of smaller birds to environmental changes and their difficulty to keep thermoregulation. Our results also indicated a low proportion of suitable area to forest-dependent birds, which is in accordance with their higher vulnerability due to specific requirements for reproduction and feeding. Finally, the proportion of suitable area was low for birds from Oceania, which is expected since the region encompasses small islands isolated from continents, preventing their species from reaching new suitable areas. Our study highlights that different traits should be considered when assessing extinction risk of species based on future projections, helping to improve bird conservation, especially the most vulnerable to climate change.

AB  - A sustainability transition (ST) of the agri-food system (AFS) is necessary due to manifold environmental and social exigencies. Scholars widely refer to the multi-level perspective (MLP) in the analysis of those transitions. The fast pace of articles covering AFS transitions, the evolving research on spaces between the three levels, and the consisting unclear conceptualization of MLP levels call for a systematic update on literature utilizing MLP in AFS articles covering ST. As a basis for reporting, this systematic literature review uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The search was conducted on the database Scopus encompassing the period from 2018 to 2022. After the selection procedure, 58 articles were included in the review. We extracted data based on a combination of a concept-driven and data-driven coding scheme. Qualitative research approaches outweigh and interrelated activities within the AFS are being analyzed, predominantly in the agricultural sectors. The focus lays on ongoing transitions. The concept of sustainability and its direction is considered as given (e.g., through the case lens), without further elaborations. The niche constitutes the most prominent object of study and scholars refer to rather socially innovative activities than technological innovations, providing distinct views on radicality and strategies to breakthrough. A space between niche and regime is being presented, with slightly distinct conceptualisations. Actors from both levels collaborate and exert transformative power. The regime is presented as static but also more vividly evolving views on the regime are demonstrated. The landscape receives the least attention and the focus lays on immaterial characteristics. Combinations of MLP with other frameworks have proven useful, for instance, regarding elaborations on the agency on the landscape level. Generally, an unclear conceptualization of regime and landscape persists, lacking a theoretical elaboration. Further research applying MLP should aim for a deeper examination of its theoretical construct, especially in terms of regime and landscape. More quantitative or mixed-methods research could supplement the current dominating qualitative approaches by testing and validating qualitatively constructed theories and phenomena.

AB  - Deer are key components of many ecosystems and estimating deer abundance or density is critical to understanding these roles. Many field methods have been used to estimate deer abundance and density, but the factors determining where, when, and why a method was used, and its usefulness, have not been investigated. We systematically reviewed journal articles published during 2004-2018 to evaluate spatio-temporal trends in study objectives, methodologies, and deer abundance and density estimates, and determine how they varied with biophysical and anthropogenic attributes. We also reviewed the precision and bias of deer abundance estimation methods. We found 3,870 deer abundance and density estimates. Most estimates (58%) were for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). The 6 key methods used to estimate abundance and density were pedestrian sign (track or fecal) counts, pedestrian direct counts, vehicular direct counts, aerial direct counts, motion-sensitive cameras, and harvest data. There were regional differences in the use of these methods, but a general pattern was a temporal shift from using harvest data, pedestrian direct counts, and aerial direct counts to using pedestrian sign counts and motion-sensitive cameras. Only 32% of estimates were accompanied by a measure of precision. The most precise estimates were from vehicular spotlight counts and from capture-recapture analysis of images from motion-sensitive cameras. For aerial direct counts, capture-recapture methods provided the most precise estimates. Bias was robustly assessed in only 16 studies. Most abundance estimates were negatively biased, but capture-recapture methods were the least biased. The usefulness of deer abundance and density estimates would be substantially improved by 1) reporting key methodological details, 2) robustly assessing bias, 3) reporting the precision of estimates, 4) using methods that increase and estimate detection probability, and 5) staying up to date on new methods. The automation of image analysis using machine learning should increase the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates from direct aerial counts (visible and thermal infrared, including from unmanned aerial vehicles [drones]) and motion-sensitive cameras, and substantially reduce the time and cost burdens of manual image analysis.

AB  - Sustainable production and consumption of food systems cannot be achieved without considering the entirety of the supply chain and the actors involved at each stage along the way. This requires more in-depth analyses of social dimensions often neglected in favor of the environmental and economic ones. Yet, inattention to the social dimension of sustainability in food supply chains has yielded a lack of agreement regarding what to consider and how to measure it. This review identifies the current state of art of how social sustainability aspects are measured through various tools and indicators, following the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) protocol. The selection criteria resulted in 101 papers and gray literature documents published from 20 0 0 to 2021. Thirty-four social sustainability tools are analyzed based on five food supply chain stages, namely production, processing, wholesale, retail, and consumer and four stakeholders as adapted from the most recent Social Life Cycle Assessment guidelines, namely farmers, workers, consumers, and society. Production and processing related assessment tools are mostly publicly funded, while wholesale, retail, and consumer tools are often privately funded. Moreover, the availability of assessment tools decreases along the supply chain. Production has the highest number of tools (17) and quantitative indicators, targeting mostly farmers through job conditions and quality of life indicators. Processing stage tools (5) target mostly workers, through quantitative indicators related to fair job conditions. The wholesaler stage tools (4) and indicators are the least connected, while the retail stage (2) is the most inclusive in terms of qualitative social sustain ability indicators. The consumer stage tools (2) also has a low number of social indicators and interactions, despite being the stage that influences the supply chain the most. It is clear that food supply chain stakeholders can benefit from the implementation of social sustainability aspects, although these benefits become inconsistent if not respected in each stage. A need for an unceasing thread of respected social sustainability should permeate the whole supply chain, as environmental certification currently does, becoming the priority for policy makers in the sector to focus their attention on the emerged hotspots for intervention from this research.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Background: There is an increasing recognition that non communicable diseases impose large economic costs on households, societies and nations. However, not much is known about the magnitude of diabetes expenditure in African countries and to the best of our knowledge no systematic assessment of the literature on diabetes costs in Africa has been conducted. The aim of this paper is to capture the evidence on the cost of diabetes in Africa, review the methods used to calculate costs and identify areas for future research.
   Methods: A desk search was conducted in Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and Science direct as well as through other databases, namely Google Scholar. The following eligibility criteria were used: peer reviewed English articles published between 2006 and 2016, articles that reported original research findings on the cost of illness in diabetes, and studies that covered at least one African country. Information was extracted using two data extraction sheets and results organized in tables. Costs presented in the studies under review are converted to 2015 international dollars prices (I$).
   Results: Twenty six articles are included in this review. Annual national direct costs of diabetes differed between countries and ranged from I$3.5 billion to I$4.5 billion per annum. Indirect costs per patient were generally higher than the direct costs per patient of diabetes. Outpatient costs varied by study design, data source, perspective and healthcare cost categories included in the total costs calculation. The most commonly included healthcare items were drug costs, followed by diagnostic costs, medical supply or disposable costs and consultation costs. In studies that reported both drug costs and total costs, drug costs took a significant portion of the total costs per patient. The highest burden due to the costs associated with diabetes was reported in individuals within the low income group.
   Conclusion: Estimation of the costs associated with diabetes is crucial to make progress towards meeting the targets laid out in Sustainable Development Goal 3 set for 2030. The studies included in this review show that the presence of diabetes leads to elevated costs of treatment which further increase in the presence of complications. The cost of drugs generally contributed the most to total direct costs of treatment. Various methods are used in the estimation of diabetes healthcare costs and the costs estimated between countries differ significantly. There is room to improve transparency and make the methodologies used standard in order to allow for cost comparisons across studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) appear to be promising predictors for endometrial cancer (EC). However, conflicting results exist in the diagnostic performance comparison among CA125 and HE4.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and other databases till December 2015. All studies included were closely assessed with the QUADAS. Diagnostic value of HE4, CA125 and HE4+CA125 was systematically evaluated, and comparison among the predictive performances of HE4, CA125 were conducted. Sensitivity, specificity, DOR (diagnostic odds ratio), and area under the SROC curve were summarized with a random model. Meta-regression was used to explore the heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: 8 studies including 1832 cases (1129 in the study group and 703 in the control group) were included in our meta-analysis. Mean estimates of HE4 and their 95% CIs were: sensitivity 0.53 (95% CI: 0.50-0.56), specificity 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89-0.93), DOR 17.01 (95% CI: 7.88-36.72). The area under the SROC curve of HE4 in the diagnosis of EC was 0.77. However, CA125 had lower sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and the area under the SROC in diagnosis of EC with sensitivity 0.26 (95% CI: 0.24-0.29), specificity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.84), DOR 2.61 (95% CI: 0.92-7.41), and the area under the SROC 0.37. In patients with EC diagnosed by HE4+CA125, the overall sensitivity was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54-0.62) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) in predicting EC. DOR and the area under the SROC curve of HE4+CA125 for diagnosis of EC were 21.86 (95% CI: 11.08-43.15) and 0.83 respectively, which showed a higher level of diagnostic accuracy than HE4 alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: HE4 is helpful for distinguishing EC from healthy and benign disease. CA125 is not better than HE4 either for EC diagnosis. HE4+CA125 is promising a predictor of EC to replace He4, but its utilization requires further exploration.

AB  - Background: Respite services provide a break in the caregiving relationship for people with dementia and their carers, however they are often under-used and service acceptability can be low. This study aims to understand key stakeholders' experiences of respite services for people with dementia, with a view to informing respite service development.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted of the Pubmed/MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases (1980-2016, English) with fixed search terms relating to 'respite' and 'dementia', following PRISMA guidelines. Noblit and Hare's approach to meta-ethnography was employed. Key concepts were identified across the papers and reciprocal and refutational translation techniques were applied to primary studies; findings were synthesized into third order interpretations and finally, a 'line-of-argument' was developed.
   Results: In total 23 papers were reviewed, which described 20 independent samples across 12 countries. The views of 889 participants were synthesized (13 people with dementia, 690 carers, 44 'service providers', 52 frontline staff, 70 managers, 12 volunteers, six academic/policy-makers, and two independent consultants). Five key concepts were identified and outlined i.e. 1) the transition to service use 2) expanding organizational capacity 3) dementia care quality 4) building a collaborative care partnership and 5) dyad restoration. There was broad agreement around the key areas for service development across the range of stakeholders (flexible and responsive person-centred care, meaningful activity for people with dementia, enhanced client-service communication and informational support). However, there was clear divergence in stakeholder perspectives around the barriers to implementation of such developments. Organizational tension was evident between frontline staff and management in respite services, hindering the cultural change necessary to facilitate service development in line with dyad's needs and preferences.
   Conclusion: Respite services must surmount internal organizational barriers to change, and cultivate a collaborative solution-focused care culture, which acknowledges the centrality of the dyad and their care preferences. Future research should explore the development of alternative/modified community respite service models, which have greater capacity to be responsive to the needs of each individual dyad. The perspectives of people with dementia must be included in research in this area going forward.

AB  - Background: Integrated vector management (IVM) is recommended as a sustainable approach to malaria control. IVM consists of combining vector control methods based on scientific evidence to maximize efficacy and cost-effectiveness while minimizing negative impacts, such as insecticide resistance and environmental damage. Zooprophylaxis has been identified as a possible component of IVM as livestock may draw mosquitoes away from humans, decreasing human-vector contact and malaria transmission. It is possible, however, that livestock may actually draw mosquitoes to humans, increasing malaria transmission (zoopotentiation). The goal of this paper is to take a realist approach to a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature to understand the contexts under which zooprophylaxis or zoopotentiation occur.
   Methods: Three electronic databases were searched using the keywords 'zooprophylaxis' and 'zoopotentiation', and forward and backward citation tracking employed, to identify relevant articles. Only empirical, peer-reviewed articles were included. Critical appraisal was applied to articles retained for full review.
   Results: Twenty empirical studies met inclusion criteria after critical appraisal. A range of experimental and observational study designs were reported. Outcome measures included human malaria infection and mosquito feeding behaviour. Two key factors were consistently associated with zooprophylaxis and zoopotentiation: the characteristics of the local mosquito vector, and the location of livestock relative to human sleeping quarters. These associations were modified by the use of bed nets and socio-economic factors.
   Discussion: This review suggests that malaria risk is reduced (zooprophylaxis) in areas where predominant mosquito species do not prefer human hosts, where livestock are kept at a distance from human sleeping quarters at night, and where mosquito nets or other protective measures are used. Zoopotentiation occurs where livestock are housed within or near human sleeping quarters at night and where mosquito species prefer human hosts.
   Conclusion: The evidence suggests that zooprophylaxis could be part of an effective strategy to reduce malaria transmission under specific ecological and geographical conditions. The current scientific evidence base is inconclusive on understanding the role of socio-economic factors, optimal distance between livestock and human sleeping quarters, and the effect of animal species and number on zooprophylaxis.

AB  - Background: The early identification of patients at risk of dying from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is critical for their treatment and for defining hospital resource consumption. Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) has been extensively investigated for its prognostic value in CAP. However, the results are conflicting. The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to explore the diagnostic accuracy of MR-proADM for predicting mortality in patients suffering from CAP, particularly emergency department (ED) patients.
   Method: We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane databases. Studies were included if a 2 x 2 contingency table could be constructed based on both the MR-proADM level and the complications or mortality of patients diagnosed with CAP. The prognostic accuracy of MR-proADM in CAP was assessed using the bivariate meta-analysis model. We used the Q-test and I-2 index to evaluate heterogeneity.
   Results: MR-proADM displayed moderate diagnostic accuracy for predicting complications in CAP, with an overall area under the SROC curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95 % CI: 0.70-0.78). Eight studies with a total of 4119 patients in the emergency department (ED) were included. An elevated MR-proADM level was associated with increased risk of death from CAP (RR 6.16, 95 % CI 4.71-8.06); the I-2 value was 0.0 %, and a fixed-effects model was used to pool RR. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.74 (95 % CI: 0.67-0.79) and 0.73 (95 % CI: 0.70-0.77), respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 2.8 (95 % CI, 2.3-3.3) and 0.36 (95 % CI, 0.29-0.45), respectively. In addition, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 8 (95 % CI, 5-11), and the overall area under the SROC curve was 0.76 (95 % CI, 0.72-0.80).
   Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated that MR-proADM is predictive of increased complications and higher mortality rates in patients suffering from CAP. Future studies are warranted to determine the prognostic accuracy of MR-proADM in conjunction with severity scores or other biomarkers and to determine an optimal cut-off level.

AB  - Introduction Proximity and access to water have long been central to human culture and accordingly deliver countless societal benefits. Over 200 million people live on Europe's coastline, and aquatic environments are the top recreational destination in the region. In terms of public health, interactions with 'blue space' (eg, coasts, rivers, lakes) are often considered solely in terms of risk (eg, drowning, microbial pollution). Exposure to blue space can, however, promote health and well-being and prevent disease, although underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
   Aims and methods The BlueHealth project aims to understand the relationships between exposure to blue space and health and well-being, to map and quantify the public health impacts of changes to both natural blue spaces and associated urban infrastructure in Europe, and to provide evidence-based information to policymakers on how to maximise health benefits associated with interventions in and around aquatic environments. To achieve these aims, an evidence base will be created through systematic reviews, analyses of secondary data sets and analyses of new data collected through a bespoke international survey and a wide range of community-level interventions. We will also explore how to deliver the benefits associated with blue spaces to those without direct access through the use of virtual reality. Scenarios will be developed that allow the evaluation of health impacts in plausible future societal contexts and changing environments. BlueHealth will develop key inputs into policymaking and land/water-use planning towards more salutogenic and sustainable uses of blue space, particularly in urban areas.
   Ethics and dissemination Throughout the BlueHealth project, ethics review and approval are obtained for all relevant aspects of the study by the local ethics committees prior to any work being initiated and an ethics expert has been appointed to the project advisory board. So far, ethical approval has been obtained for the BlueHealth International Survey and for community-level interventions taking place in Spain, Italy and the UK. Engagement of stakeholders, including the public, involves citizens in many aspects of the project. Results of all individual studies within the BlueHealth project will be published with open access. After full anonymisation and application of any measures necessary to prevent disclosure, data generated in the project will be deposited into open data repositories of the partner institutions, in line with a formal data management plan. Other knowledge and tools developed in the project will be made available via the project website (www.bluehealth2020.eu). Project results will ultimately provide key inputs to planning and policy relating to blue space, further stimulating the integration of environmental and health considerations into decision-making, such that blue infrastructure is developed across Europe with both public health and the environment in mind.

AB  - 1. The number of published meta-analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta-analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.
   2. We identified 322 meta-analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta-analysis, the quality of published meta-analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.
   3. We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term 'meta-analysis' in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta-analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta-analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.
   4. Methodological issues for meta-analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.
   5. The use of meta-analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta-analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta-analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.
   6. Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta-analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta-analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta-analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta-analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.

AB  - Farmland protection is important for ensuring national food security and promoting sustainable socioeconomic development. China has a far lower amount of farmland area per capita than the global average. To improve farmland productivity, the Chinese government has implemented a basic farmland protection system (BFPS). A comprehensive and systematic analysis of the evolution mechanism of the BFPS, the failures of the BFPS and the key measures of the modern BFPS reform is lacking in the current literature. Based on a systematic review of the history of China's BFPS, this study first summarizes the evolutionary mechanism of the BFPS, then analyzes the current conflicts faced by the BFPS on this basis, proposes several main breakthrough strategies for improving the BFPS and finally provides key ideas for further strengthening the development of the BFPS in the future. The results of this study show that China's BFPS has gone through three development stages since 1963 and that there are differences in the main factors hindering the improvement in basic farmland productivity in the different stages. Correspondingly, the systems adopted to meet the demands for basic farmland protection are also different. The evolution of the BFPS is similar to a "scale" that constantly seeks balance between "system demand" and "system supply". In the present stage, the main conflicts faced by China's BFPS are between basic farmland quality and requirements for supplementary delimitation and production patterns; between basic farmland quantity, urban development and food security; and between basic farmland-use regulation and modern agriculture and the market economy. The Chinese government should further optimize the BFPS through improving the delimitation system, establishing a classified protection system and strengthening the basic farmland protection compensation system. To accelerate the establishment of a territorial spatial planning system in the future, the BFPS should also be fully integrated with the concept of an ecological civilization, be applied to resolve the contradiction between development and protection and be used to help improve the land-space-utilization control system, thus creating a unified development guide for national land.

AB  - Background: Successful models of nursing and midwifery in the community delivering healthcare throughout the lifespan and across a health and illness continuum are limited, yet necessary to guide global health services. Primary and community health services are the typical points of access for most people and the location where most care is delivered. The scope of primary healthcare is complex and multifaceted and therefore requires a practice framework with sound conceptual and theoretical underpinnings. The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual model informed by a scoping evidence review of the literature.
   Methods: A scoping evidence review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Databases included CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SocINDEX using the EBSCO platform and the Cochrane Library using the keywords: model, nursing, midwifery, community, primary care. Grey literature for selected countries was searched using the Google 'advanced' search interface. Data extraction and quality appraisal for both empirical and grey literature were conducted independently by two reviewers. From 127 empirical and 24 non-empirical papers, data extraction parameters, in addition to the usual methodological features, included: the nature of nursing and midwifery; the population group; interventions and main outcomes; components of effective nursing and midwifery outcomes.
   Results: The evidence was categorised into six broad areas and subsequently synthesised into four themes. These were not mutually exclusive: (1) Integrated and Collaborative Care; (2) Organisation and Delivery of Nursing and Midwifery Care in the Community; (3) Adjuncts to Nursing Care and (4) Overarching Conceptual Model. It is the latter theme that is the focus of this paper. In essence, the model depicts a person/client on a lifespan and preventative-curative trajectory. The health related needs of the client, commensurate with their point position, relative to both trajectories, determines the nurse or midwife intervention. Consequently, it is this need, that determines the discipline or speciality of the nurse or midwife with the most appropriate competencies.
   Conclusion: Use of a conceptual model of nursing and midwifery to inform decision-making in primary/community based care ensures clinical outcomes are meaningful and more sustainable. Operationalising this model for nursing and midwifery in the community demands strong leadership and effective clinical governance.

AB  - BackgroundThe literature on the prevalence of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents has expanded significantly over the last three decades around the world. Despite the field having matured significantly, there has been no meta-analysis to calculate a worldwide-pooled prevalence and to empirically assess the sources of heterogeneity of estimates.
   MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature searching in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for prevalence studies of mental disorders investigating probabilistic community samples of children and adolescents with standardized assessments methods that derive diagnoses according to the DSM or ICD. Meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the prevalence rates of any mental disorder and individual diagnostic groups. A meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of population and sample characteristics, study methods, assessment procedures, and case definition in determining the heterogeneity of estimates.
   ResultsWe included 41 studies conducted in 27 countries from every world region. The worldwide-pooled prevalence of mental disorders was 13.4% (CI 95% 11.3-15.9). The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 6.5% (CI 95% 4.7-9.1), any depressive disorder was 2.6% (CI 95% 1.7-3.9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was 3.4% (CI 95% 2.6-4.5), and any disruptive disorder was 5.7% (CI 95% 4.0-8.1). Significant heterogeneity was detected for all pooled estimates. The multivariate metaregression analyses indicated that sample representativeness, sample frame, and diagnostic interview were significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Estimates did not vary as a function of geographic location of studies and year of data collection. The multivariate model explained 88.89% of prevalence heterogeneity, but residual heterogeneity was still significant. Additional meta-analysis detected significant pooled difference in prevalence rates according to requirement of funcional impairment for the diagnosis of mental disorders.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that mental disorders affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide. The pooled prevalence estimates and the identification of sources of heterogeneity have important implications to service, training, and research planning around the world.

AB  - According to the United Nations (UN), although cities occupy only 3% of Earth's surface, they host more than half of the global population, are responsible for 70% of energy consumption, and 75% of carbon emissions. All this is a consequence of the massive urbanization verified since the 1950s and which is expected to continue in the coming decades. A crucial issue will therefore concern the management of existing cities and the planning of future ones, and this was also emphasized by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and communities). Smart Cities are often seen as ideal urban environments in which the different dimensions of a city (economy, education, energy, environment, etc.) are managed successfully and proactively. So, one of the most important challenges cities will have to face, is to guide citizens towards a form of "clean" energy consumption, and the dimension on which decision-makers will be able to work is the decarbonization of transport. To achieve this, electric mobility could help reduce polluting emissions on the road. Within this research, the strategies that six Smart Cities (London, Hamburg, Oslo, Milan, Florence, and Bologna) have implemented to encourage the transition to this form of mobility have been studied. Through a systematic review of the literature (Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) and through the study of the main political/energy documents of the cities, their policies on electric mobility have been evaluated. Then, for each city, SDG 11.6.2 was analyzed to assess the air quality in the last four years (2016-2019) and, therefore, the effectiveness of the policies. The analysis showed, in general, that the policies have worked, inducing reductions in the pollutants of PM2.5, PM10, NO2. In particular, the cities showed the most significant reduction in pollutant (above 20%) were Hamburg (-28% PM2.5 and -2%6 NO2), Milan (-25% PM2.5 and -52% NO2), and London (-26% NO2).

AB  - Introduction Australia has achieved universal health insurance for its popu-lation since 1975 - a major step forward for increasing access to primary care (PC). Nevertheless, there are reports of several multi-layered challenges, includ-ing inequity, that persist. This analysis aims to undertake a scoping review of the success, explanatory factors, and challenges of Primary Health Care (PHC) in Australia guided by the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined key charac-teristics of good PC.Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science using key terms related to PHC principles, attributes, system functioning and health care delivery modalities. We also used key PC terminologies used to assess key char-acteristics of good PC developed by WHO and key terms and attributes from Australia's health care landscape. We then integrated our search terms with the PHC Search Filters developed by Brown, L., et al. (2014). We restricted the search from 2013 to 2021. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and performed a quality check on the extracted data. We presented findings accord-ing to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Results We identified 112 articles on primary health care (PHC), represented from all Australian states and territories. Overall, Australian PHC has achieved comprehensiveness, access and coverage, quality of care, patient / person centered-ness and service coordination indicators with exemplary evidence-base practice/ knowledge translation and clinical decision-making practices at the PC settings. Yet, we identified complex and multilayered barriers including geographic and socio-economic berries and inequality, staff dissatisfaction/turn over, low adop-tion of person-centred care, inadequate sectoral collaboration, and inadequate infrastructure in rural and remote primary care units. Conclusion Primary health care in Australia, which has evolved through major reforms, has been adapting to the complex health care needs of the socio-cul-turally diversified nation, and has achieved many of the PC attributes, including service diversity, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care. Yet, there are persistent gaps in service delivery to socio-economically disadvantaged popula-tions, including indigenous people, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations, and rural-and remote-residents. These challenges could be mitigat-ed through system-wide and targeted policy-level intervention to further improve service delivery through effective and functional local health service coordination, sectoral integration, and improving health care providers' cultural competence.

AB  - Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

AB  - Background: The rate of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka has increased in recent years, with associated morbidity and economic cost to the country. This review examines the published literature for the characteristics and factors associated with non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in Psychinfo, Proquest, Medline and Cochrane databases from inception to October 2011.
   Results: 26 publications (representing 23 studies) were eligible to be included in the review. A majority of studies reported non-fatal self-poisoning to be more common among males, with a peak age range of 10-30 years. Pesticide ingestion was the most commonly used method of non-fatal self-poisoning. However three studies conducted within the last ten years, in urban areas of the country, reported non-fatal self-poisoning by medicinal overdose to be more common, and also reported non-fatal self-poisoning to be more common among females. Interpersonal conflict was the most commonly reported short-term stressor associated with self-poisoning. Alcohol misuse was reported among males who self-poisoned, and data regarding other psychiatric morbidity was limited.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that pesticide ingestion is the commonest method of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka, and it is more common among young males, similar to other Asian countries. However there appears to be an emerging pattern of increasing medicinal overdoses, paralleled by a gender shift towards increased female non-fatal self-poisoning in urban areas.
   Many non-fatal self-poisoning attempts appear to occur in the context of acute interpersonal stress, with short premeditation, and associated with alcohol misuse in males. Similar to other Asian countries, strategies to reduce non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka require integrated intervention programs with several key aspects, including culturally appropriate interventions to develop interpersonal skills in young people, community based programs to reduce alcohol misuse, and screening for and specific management of those at high risk of repetition following an attempt of self-poisoning.

AB  - Purpose
   Hospital information system (HIS) can be examined as a vital factor for developing the quality of health care and cost managing. There exists abundant literature on HISs, but implementation-based literature of HIS is rare, typically about progressive countries. However, a study that can comprehensively review published articles is scarce. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the systematic and comprehensive study of HIS in developed countries. Together, the benefits and harms relevant to HIS's different mechanisms have been considered, and the fundamental challenges of them are addressed to design more efficient HIS in the future.
   Design/methodology/approach
   HIS has been used globally for numerous years and is now being used in a wide area. HIS is broadly used in clinical settings. Information technology (IT) and information system have been suggested as a required piece to solve the health-care-related issues. Hence, to improve HIS's ability, this paper conducted a review method concentratating on research related to HIS until 2019. A total of 21 papers were recognized and examined as principal research for the summary.
   Findings
   The authors found that HIS can help in reduction of medical mistakes, enhancement doctors' performance and increase in the quality of the care provided. HIS management can be used to provide better health-care services. Therefore, HIS must be sensible and use clear structures. The authors conclude that, generally, with an increase in awareness, acceptability and the need for HIS worldwide, there will be more strategies and approaches available.
   Research limitations/implications
   First, this paper provides an outline of the status of HIS. Second, it identifies some distinct research gaps that could be worth studying. Some flawless work may be removed because of applying some filters to select the original articles. Surveying all the papers on the topic of HIS is impossible, too.
   Practical implications

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this document is to carry out a critical review of the existing literature by specifically addressing the following: (i) the integration of life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment from the perspective of research topics, category and scope of study, authors, institutions, countries, and journals working on or publishing related studies, and (ii) the main aids, challenges, opportunities, methodological difficulties, and current research efforts on the integrated approach of both tools. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify studies with an integrated use of life cycle assessment and life cycle cost in several areas. An analysis of the main aspects of the studies identified, such as bibliographic reference, year of publication, institution where the research was conducted, country, area of application, category of study, journal of publication, impact factor, and number of citations was conducted. After a search in the Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, 349 documents were identified. After a series of filters (excluding gray literature, reading titles and keywords, reading abstracts, and reading full-texts), which helped ruling out articles that did not contribute to investigating the integration of life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment, 90 documents were selected for a detailed analysis. Results and discussion The leading role of the USA and European countries in this issue should be highlighted. The integration of life cycle assessment and life cycle cost seems to be most advanced in the areas of building design and civil construction. Different strategies for the integration of the methodologies are also found, being mathematical modelling and programming for optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making the most recurrent methods. Moreover, there seems to be more challenges than opportunities in said integration. The challenges include the monetization of environmental impacts, higher volatility of economic data compared to environmental data, and differences in environmental and economic background data. These challenges can be turned into opportunities in the development of more comprehensive methodological approaches. Conclusion Challenges (e.g., time-, resource- and knowledge-intensive, different scopes) and opportunities (e.g., common system boundaries, benefitting from LCA structure to conduct LCC) for the integration of life cycle assessment and life cycle cost were identified. This combined approach allows projects, products, and services to reduce environmental and economic impacts, which can be quantified and compared through improved assessment of potential trade-offs.

AB  - Purpose China after 1949, especially since entering the 21st century, significant progress has been made in leadership research under Chinese context. However, so far there has been no systematic review and prospect of China's leadership research in the past 70 years. Therefore, with the help of scientific visualization software Citespace, this paper analyzes the research papers on leadership in the context of China from the top international journals of management science and applied psychology (1949-2018), supplemented and verified the previous research conclusions based on qualitative review, and quantitatively demonstrated the research evolution of leadership field. Design Methodology Approach Using a scientific visualization tool CiteSpace and 145 international leadership works, which were published in 64 top international journals and collected from the Web of Science database, and 852 domestic works which were published in 28 top domestic journals and collected from the CNKI database from 1949 to 2018, we draws keyword co-occurrence knowledge graph and keyword strategy map to visualize the landscape and evolution of leadership research and analyze the hot topics and research trends in the field of leadership. Findings The research found that: (1) Before 2002, there were only 7 articles published in 64 international top journal, mainly focusing on Western leadership theories such as transformational, cross-cultural comparison and the adaptability in Chinese context; (2) From 2003 to 2012, scholars had begun to introduce mainstream quantitative research paradigm in international academic community; (3) From 2013 to 2018, researches tended to be synchronized, with 461 and 99 papers published respectively. How emerging leaderships (such as ethical leadership) affect on various emerging outcome variables (such as creativity, voice behavior, unethical pro-organizational behavior etc.) is hot topic for future research. Originality Value Different from the previous qualitative reviews on organizational culture research, this paper, for the first time, uses bibliometric research methods to systematically analyze the evolution path of leadership research during the 70 years of China(1949-2018, and puts forward the future research prospects.

AB  - Background: Integrated community case management (iCCM) is a community-based child health strategy designed to reduce deaths due to pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea in low-income countries. Due to the integrated nature of the intervention and the diversity of its stakeholders and activities, iCCM is complex and comprises many systems elements. However, the extent to which studies examine these different elements is unknown. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the key areas of emphasis of the iCCM literature and assess the extent to which this takes into account systems complexity.
   Methods: This study will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology. We will systematically screen MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the specialized platform Community Case Management (CCM) Central Library for published literature in English related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of iCCM. Two investigators will independently screen the full list of titles and abstracts for eligibility, followed by a full-text review of selected titles divided between investigators. Emergent themes will be categorized according to a thematic tool iteratively developed to guide the charting and analysis process. To compare the extent to which the literature assesses systems factors, we will compare our results with the iCCM Interagency Framework. We will use the Intervention Complexity Tool for Systematic Reviews (iCAT_SR) to assess how literature measures complexity. Results will be presented in narrative fashion, supplemented by interactive graphical interfaces.
   Discussion The results of this scoping review will identify the priorities and deficiencies of the analysis and evaluation of iCCM programs and may illustrate the need for systems approaches. Bottom-up emergent iCCM themes can help researchers, policymakers, and implementers target and better emphasize true priorities of iCCM. Understanding how complexity is considered and examined in iCCM may result in greater attention to this critical dimension of iCCM program assessment, resulting in the design and development of more robust and sustainable iCCM programs.

AB  - 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) is a promising technology gaining rapid development in the recent past. Numerous reviews focused on 3D printing (3DP) in construction but very few reviews on nature-inspired 3DCP. Therefore, a thematic review of current trends in nature-inspired 3DCP is needed. Thematic reviews conducted manually are time-consuming and require repeated and indepth reading. In recent times, researchers have reasoned using coding for literature studies. Therefore, this study is aimed to synthesise literature for the application of nature-inspired strategies into 3DCP building envelopes using Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). To achieve the goal a CAQDAS tool was implemented for Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Thematic Content Analysis (TCA) in the five identified thematic areas such as 3D concrete printing, biomimicry, thermal and energy performance, infill patterns, and simulation tools. This study is limited to the last 10 years of literature from the Scopus database. In order to conduct the SLR and TCA, a three-step methodology was adopted. The first step was to plan the review; the second step was to systematically search and screen the relevant literature; and the third step was to synthesis and report the extracted data in the respective thematic categories. The outcome of SLR fetched 36 articles relevant to the topic whereas TCA established a relationship between the various identified themes and synthesised the existing knowledge in the field of 3DCP. The findings from the TCA showcased that the optimisation of the building envelope improved the structural, thermal, and energy performance of the 3DCP buildings and their contribution to the overall sustainability potential. The significance of this analysis describes the current trends in this field and adds beneficial insights into determining the sustainable aspects of 3DCP building envelopes in terms of optimising the structural, thermal, and energy performance. The contribution to this review has shown the benefits of bioinspired design application in the 3DCP and listed the future research areas for the researchers.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities and greater demands for marine natural resources has led to increases in the spatial extent and duration of pressures onmarine ecosystems. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a robust survey tool for quantifying these pressures and tracking the success of management intervention while at a range of depths, including those inaccessible to most SCUBA diver-based survey methods (similar to>30 m). As the strengths, limitations, and biases of ROVs for visually monitoring fish assemblages remain unclear, this review aims to evaluate ROVs as a survey technique and to suggest optimal sampling strategies for use in typical ROV-based studies. Using the search engines Scopus (TM) and Google Scholar (TM), 119 publications were identified that used ROVs for visual surveys of fish assemblages. While the sampling strategies and sampling metrics used to annotate the imagery in these publications varied considerably, the total abundance of fish recorded over strip transects of varying dimensions was the most common sampling design. The choice of ROV system appears to be a strong indicator of both the types of surveys available to studies and the success of ROV deployments. For instance, larger, more powerful working-class systems can complete longer and more complex designs (e.g., swath, cloverleaf, and polygonal transects) at greater depths, whereas observation-class systems are less expensive and easier to deploy, but are more susceptible to delays or cancelations of deployments. In more severe sea state conditions, radial transects, or strip transects that employ live-boating or a weight to anchor the tether to the seafloor, can be used to improve the performance of observation-class systems. As these systems often employ shorter tethers, radial transects can also be used to maximize sampling area at greater depths and on large vessels that may rotate substantially while anchored. For highly mobile species, and in survey designs where individuals are likely to be recounted (e.g., transects along oil and gas pipelines), relative abundance (MaxN) may be a more robust sampling metric. By identifying subtle, yet important, differences in the application of ROVs as a tool for visually surveying deep-water marine ecosystems, we identified key areas for improvement for best practice for future studies.

AB  - The global food system is a major contributor to climate change with 23-42% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, the transition to sustainable food systems and dietary patterns represents a big challenge and a key solution to feed a fast-growing world population while maintaining safe planet boundaries of sustainability. Organic farming is often proposed as a sustainable option, however a debate is open on its effectiveness in reducing the impact on climate when compared to conventional agriculture. Therefore, there is a need for clear indicators of climate and environmental sustainability to duly inform the food system actors and foster an effective transition towards sustainable food production and consumption. The carbon footprint (CF) is one of the most used indicators to assess the sustainability of food as it measures the contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions with different metrics (e.g. GHG per unit of product or per unit of land).Through a systematic analysis of the existing peer-reviewed studies allowing an unbiased comparison of product-based vs land-based CF, this study shows that organic food has on average lower impact on climate than conventional, both when the CF is assessed per 'land unit' (-43% GHG emissions, average) and per 'product unit' (-12% GHG emissions, average). However, the two CF metrics provide diverse results, even opposite in some cases, when individual conventional vs organic food types are compared: organic food results to be more sus-tainable than conventional in almost all cases when the 'land unit' CF metric is compared; conversely, con-ventional food results to be less impacting than organic in the 29% of cases when the 'product unit' CF is considered. According to these results, although the CF per unit of product is far more used and provides useful indications on the food emissions intensity, in some cases it can bring a misleading message towards unsus-tainability, with the paradox of making more preferable food that apparently shows lower impact per unit of product while having higher emissions per land unit. Contrariwise, the CF per unit of land better reflects the actual agricultural contribution to climate change which is driven by the land-atmosphere GHG fluxes.According to this study's results and in view of the global climate policies' targets which foster organic food production and the transition to sustainable diets, an extensive conversion of the existing global croplands into organic lands would significantly contribute to reducing total GHG emissions from the land sector.

AB  - Electric mobility is emerging all around the world to minimize environmental impacts, reduce dependency on petroleum, and diversify energy sources for transportation. Any emerging technology comes with uncertainties in terms of its environmental, economic, and social impacts on the global society, and history has shown that some technological changes have led also to great societal transformation thus shaping our future as humanity. Understanding, perceiving, and anticipating the potential changes are essential to managing as well as internalizing maximum benefits out of these technological advancements for a sustainable global community. In the literature, life cycle assessment approaches are mainly used to assess the potential environmental impacts of electric vehicles. Considering the potential impacts of emerging transportation technologies, traditional life cycle assessment is not sufficient to analyze economic and social impacts, ripple, side, or rebound effects, macro-economic impacts, and global-supply chain related impacts. In response to these knowledge gaps, traditional environmental life cycle assessment approaches are evolving into new more integrated, and broader approaches (e.g., life cycle sustainability assessment). This research aims to reveal research gaps in the sustainability assessment of electric vehicles and provide an outlook of the current state of knowledge, perspectives on research gaps, and potential ways for the adoption of integrated life-cycle modeling approaches. We conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on sustainability assessment studies for emerging electric vehicle technologies for the period between 2009 and 2020 using the Scopus database. A total of 138 life cycle assessment studies focusing on electric and autonomous (electric) vehicles are analyzed. The reviewed studies are classified and analyzed based on sustainability indicators, life cycle approaches, life cycle phases, data sources and regions, and vehicle technology and class. We also compared the global warming potential of battery electric vehicles of different class sizes. According to the literature review, five major knowledge gaps are identified; 1) lack of socioeconomic assessment, 2) lack of integrated modeling approaches and macro-level assessment; 3) limited consideration of end-of-life management and circular economy applications, 4) underrepresented developing world; 5) underrepresented emerging technologies. The findings of this review can help researchers worldwide to overview the state-of-art and state-of-practice in the field of sustainability assessment of emerging technologies and electric vehicles.

AB  - The agri-food frameworks have specific characteristics (production units with small dimensions and in great number with implications in the respective markets) that call for adjusted approaches, even more so when they are considered in Mediterranean contexts (where global warming will have relevant impacts). In fact, the Mediterranean regions and countries have particular specificities (due to their climate conditions) that distinguish them from their neighbours. This is particularly true in Europe, for example, where the southern countries present socioeconomic dynamics (associated with the respective public debt) that are different from those identified in the northern regions. From this perspective, it seems pertinent to analyse the several dimensions of the agri-food systems in the Mediterranean area. To achieve these objectives, a search was carried out on 26 December 2020 on the scientific databases Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) and Scopus for the topics "agr*-food" and "Mediterranean". These keywords were selected after a previous literature survey and to capture the agri-food contexts in Mediterranean regions. The keyword "agr*-food" was considered in this way to allow for a wider search (including "agri-food", "agro-food", etc.). Considering only articles (excluding proceeding papers, book chapters, and books, because in some cases it is difficult to access the entire content of the document), 100 and 117 documents were obtained from the WoS and Scopus, respectively. After removing the duplicated studies and taking into account the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach, 137 documents were surveyed through a literature review. As main insights, several dimensions embedded in the concept of agri-food were highlighted, from those related to heritage subjects to natural assets. On the other hand, the following subtopics were identified: agri-food dynamics and sustainability, agriculture and agri-food systems, agri-chains and food consumption, and food production and composition impact on agri-chains. Stressing the gaps in the scientific literature, related to the topics here addressed, there are possibilities to better explore the several dimensions and solutions offered by the new developments associated with smart agriculture and agriculture 4.0, specifically for the Mediterranean contexts and their challenges. Finally, to complement the PRISMA methodologies, an MB2MBA2 (Methodology Based on Benchmarking of Metadata, from scientific databases, and Bibliometric Assessment and Analysis) approach is suggested to carry out systematic literature reviews, based on bibliometric analysis.

AB  - Contaminants may affect ecosystem functioning by reducing the fitness of organisms and these impacts may cascade through ecosystems, particularly if the sensitive organisms are also habitat-forming species. Understanding how sublethal effects of toxicants can affect the quality and functions of biogenic habitats is critical if we are to establish effective guidelines for protecting ecosystems. We carried out a global systematic review and meta-analysis critically evaluating contaminant effects on properties of habitat-formers linked to ecosystem functioning. We reviewed a total of 95 publications. However, 40% of publications initially captured by the literature search were identified as having flaws in experimental design and similar to 11 % did not present results in an appropriate way and thus were excluded from the quantitative meta-analysis. We quantitatively reviewed 410 studies from 46 publications, of which 313 (similar to 76%) were on plants and seaweeds, that is macro-algae, saltmarsh plants and seagrasses, 58 (similar to 14%) studied corals and 39 (similar to 10%) looked at toxicant impacts on bivalves, with 70% of those on mussels and the remaining studies on oysters. Response variables analysed were photosynthetic efficiency, amount of chlorophyll a (as a proxy for primary production) and growth of plants, seaweeds and corals as well as leaf area of plants. We also analysed filtration, growth and respiration rates of bivalves. Our meta-analysis found that chemical contaminants have a significant negative impact on most of the analysed functional variables, with the exception of the amount of chlorophyll a. Metals were the most widely harmful type of contaminant, significantly decreasing photosynthetic efficiency of kelps, leaf area of saltmarsh plants, growth of fucoids, corals and saltmarsh plants and the filtration rates of bivalves. Organic contaminants decreased the photosynthetic efficiency of seagrass, but had no significant effects on bivalve filtration. We did not find significant effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on any of the analysed functional variables or habitat-forming taxa, but this could be due to the low number of studies available. A meta-regression revealed that relationships between concentrations of metal contaminants and the magnitude of functional responses varied with the type of metal and habitat-former. Increasing concentrations of contaminants significantly increased the negative effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of habitat-formers. There was, however, no apparent relationship between ecologically relevant concentrations of metals and effect sizes of photosynthetic efficiency of corals and seaweeds. A qualitative analysis of all relevant studies found slightly different patterns when compared to our quantitative analysis, emphasising the need for studies to meet critical inclusion criteria for meta-analyses. Our study highlights links between effects of contaminants at lower levels of organisation (i.e. at the biochemical and/or physiological level of individuals) and ecological, large-scale impacts, through effects on habitat-forming species. Contaminants can clearly reduce the functioning of many habitat-forming marine species. We therefore recommend the adoption of routine measures of functional endpoints in monitoring and conservation programs to complement structural measures.

AB  - BackgroundGlobally, the response to climate change is gradually gaining momentum as the impacts of climate change unfold. In South Africa, it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods. While slow progress with mitigation, especially in the energy sector, has garnered much attention, focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change.MethodsWe applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in South Africa. This case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the African region, or globally. We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed and Web of Science, together with relevant grey literature. We included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible. Data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically.ResultsOf the 820 publications screened, 21 were included, together with an additional xx papers. Very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high-quality research designs. Several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels. These, however, pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Systems for forecasting extreme weather, and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established. Yet, there is little evidence about the country's preparedness for extreme weather events, or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events. Seemingly, few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings. To date, little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers.ConclusionsOverall, the volume and quality of research is disappointing, and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in South Africa. This is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy, identifying effective interventions and implementing systems-based approaches rests within the health sector. More effective use of data, a traditional strength of health professionals, could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state. With increased health-sector leadership, climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent, adequately-resourced response. Such a shift in South Africa, but also beyond the country, may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - Social life cycle assessment (SLCA) is a methodology under continuous development, which may be applied at different scales: from products to economic sectors up to systems at region (meso) and country (macro) scales. Traditionally, SLCA has been focusing on the assessment of negative social externalities, whereas also positive social impacts could be associated to human interventions. The purpose of the present study is to understand how positive impacts are defined in published literature and how they could be assessed through indicators. The aim is to clarify the concept among scholars and to support decision making in business and policy context.
   The study uses a systematic review approach in order to analyse the types of indicators adopted. In the field of SLCA and according to Paragahawewa et al. (2009), "[I]ndicators are 'pointers' to the state of the impact categories (and/or subcategories) being evaluated by the SLCA". Indicators can be quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative (UNEP/SETAC 2009). This review was carried out in order to identify and analyse positive impacts and indicators. After careful scrutiny, 47 papers containing theoretical frameworks were considered, as well as 46 papers presenting case studies.
   Compared to environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), where the presence of positive impacts is lower, evaluating benefits or positive impacts can still play a major role in SLCA (BenoIt et al. 2010). A quarter of the analysed papers on theoretical frameworks take into account the topic of positive impacts and indicators. Results from case study analysis highlight as "workers", was the most considered stakeholder (in 100 % of the analysed papers), and as the majority of positive indicators used in the case study analysed are recorded in relation to "other value chain actors". Within the concept of "positive impacts", no reference should be made merely to the utility of a product or service. In a broader sense, we could refer to solutions improving the conditions of one or various stakeholders involved. In other words, these are solutions that carry a positive contribution to one or more stakeholders without harming others.
   So far, positive impacts are barely covered in literature. There is a clear need of streamlining definition and indicators, especially if they should be applied in a policy context complementing traditional-and often monetary-based, cost-benefit analysis (CBA).

AB  - Purpose - "Technological intelligence" is the capacity to appreciate and adapt technological advancements, and "artificial intelligence" is the key to achieve persuasive operational transformations in majority of contemporary organizational set-ups. Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics.
   Design/methodology/approach - As rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article. A sum of 1,854 articles extracted from Scopus database for the year 2018-2019 (31st of May) with selected keywords (artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, agent-based systems, expert systems, big data analytics and operations management) along with certain filters (subject-business, management and accounting; language-English; document-article, article in press, review articles and source-journals).
   Findings - Results obtained from cluster analysis focus on predominant themes for present as well as future researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. Emerged clusters include Cluster 1: Artificial Intelligence and Optimization; Cluster 2: Industrial Engineering/Research and Automation; Cluster 3: Operational Performance and Machine Learning; Cluster 4: Sustainable Supply Chains and Sustainable Development; Cluster 5: Technology Adoption and Green Supply Chain Management and Cluster 6: Internet of Things and Reverse Logistics.
   Originality/value - The result of review of selected studies is in itself a unique contribution and a food for thought for operations managers and policy makers.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to contribute to the event legacy discourse by exploring the nexus between event legacy literature and destination competitiveness by focusing on disability sport events or parasport and addressing an identified gap in the research literature.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is achieved through conducting a systematic review of disability sport events literature; performing an audit of international disability sport events; developing a typology of disability sport events; and outlining a research agenda drawing upon these previous steps. The typology is then placed in context to the destination competitiveness framework to provide direction for both host organizing committees and tourism destination managers. The research framework reflects the complexity of disability sport events with specific reference to the social impact of disability sport events for destinations.
   Findings - Despite calls for increased research into accessible tourism and events, the potential social legacy for communities and destinations from disability sport or parasport events remains absent from most sport, event and tourism literature. The findings and resultant typology from this study provide an interdisciplinary approach to value add to the disability sport event and destination management sectors. The combined understanding of both sectors creates an opportunity to leverage further events through marketing accessibility as a competitive advantage, seizing opportunity for international and national disability events, and the subsequent event accessible tourism and general accessible tourism that improved destination accessibility provides a host city or precinct.
   Research limitations/implications - The disability sport event typology and a research agenda that supports future research are outcomes of this research.
   Practical implications - These insights are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging the opportunities from disability sport events to support sustainable destination development and competiveness that reflect the needs of a population with diverse access needs, including our ageing population, those with temporary disability and parents with young children.
   Originality/value - This research lays the groundwork to support the desired social legacy for future host communities. From a theoretical perspective, given the paucity of research on disability sport, the typology offers a means to evaluate and monitor the impacts of various types of events from the perspectives of sustainable development, tourism, accessibility, community engagement and public policy. The addition of understanding destination competitiveness and the underlying criteria for accessible destination development provides opportunities to further leverage disability sport event beyond the event itself for ongoing accessible events, tourism and disability employment opportunities.

AB  - Institution-oriented, top-down and community-oriented, bottom-up stakeholder approaches are evaluated for their ability to enable or constrain the implementation of adaptation in developing nations. A systematic review approach is used evaluate the project performance of 18 adaptation projects by three of the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) adaptation programmes (the Strategic Priority for Adaptation (SPA), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPA)) according to effectiveness, efficiency, equity, legitimacy, flexibility, sustainability, and replicability. The ten SPA projects reviewed performed highest overall, especially with regards to efficiency, legitimacy, and replicability. The five SCCF projects performed the highest in equity, flexibility, and sustainability, and the three NAPA-related projects were the highest-performing projects with regards to effectiveness. A comparison of top-down and bottom-up approaches revealed that community stakeholder engagement in project design and implementation led to higher effectiveness, efficiency, equity, flexibility, legitimacy, sustainability, and replicability. Although low institutional capacity constrained both project success and effective community participation, projects that hired international staff to assist in implementation experienced higher overall performance. These case studies also illustrate how participatory methods can fail to genuinely empower or involve communities in adaptation interventions in both top-down and bottom-up approaches. It is thus crucial to carefully consider stakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.Policy relevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and research agenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information on the factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptation in developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerability and implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be an important factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, no study has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actual implementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholder engagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting, due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptation options, weak institutions, and competing interests to address more immediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment. In this context, this article documents and characterizes stakeholder engagement in adaptation interventions supported through the GEF, examining how top-down or bottom-up stakeholder approaches enable or constrain project performance.

AB  - Context. Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined.
   Aims. Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective.
   Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools.
   Key results. Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7).
   Conclusions. Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline.
   Implications. Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.

AB  - Food security is a central priority for international policy as one of the world's most significantly urgent targets to achieve. It is considered one of the most pressing issues in many countries, the degree of food security representing the level of self-sufficiency and well-being of citizens. In particular, in the current COVID-19 pandemic era, it has more than ever become a mission-critical goal. In this research, we report on the food security drivers and the current state of recommended policies addressing chronic food insecurity aimed at ensuring the sustainability of future food production. Mapping the determinants of food security contributes to a better understanding of the issue and aids in the development of appropriate food security policies and strategies to enhance the sustainability of food production in all facets; namely environmental, social, and economic. Adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) data screening and selection guidelines and standards, we carried out a comprehensive, reliable, systematic, and rigorous review of research from the last ten years in order to identify the most frequently mentioned drivers and policies of food security in the literature available in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science (WOS). The number of extracted articles was 141 papers in total. An analysis revealed 34 drivers of food security and 17 most recommended policies for the mitigation of food insecurity. The existence of food loss and waste (FLW) policies was the primary driver of food security, followed by food security policies (FSP) in their different forms. However, FSP were the most recommended policies, followed by FLW policies. The identified food security drivers and recommended policies should be used by policy-makers to improve food security, thus contributing to sustainable food production. Our research findings, reflected in the latest version of the Global Food Security Index (GFSI), resulted in more tangible policy implications, suggesting the addition of two dimensions regarding food security. We also identified elements not listed under the GFSI that could be considered in its future revision, including environmental policies/indicators, consumer representation, and traceability throughout the entire supply chain. Overall, it can be concluded that food security is a complicated and multi-faceted issue that cannot be restricted to a single variable, necessitating the deeper integration of various multi-disciplinary interventions.

AB  - BackgroundAsylum seekers and refugees (AS&Rs) experience impaired mental health and wellbeing, related to stresses in their country of origin, experiences in transit and reception on arrival, including significant barriers to accessing mainstream services. Their contact with health care is often crisis-driven and mediated through non-governmental organisations (NGOs).Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organisation to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high-income country.MethodsIn a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), PM+ will be delivered to AS&Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery.We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-min sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm.Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, presence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder and service usage. Longer-term impact will be assessed at 6 months post baseline, on the same parameters.We will assess the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in relation to the following elements: recruitment and retention of lay therapists and study participants; fidelity of delivery of PM+; and suitability of the study measures, including any linguistic or cultural barriers.DiscussionWe will use these findings to specify the parameters for a full RCT to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PM+ in reducing emotional distress and health inequalities, and improving functional ability and wellbeing, amongst asylum seekers and refugees.Trial registrationISRCTN, ID: ISRCTN15214107.

AB  - The processes of urbanization and industrialization within geological phosphorus-rich mountains (GPMn) have resulted in water degradation within southwest China. Lake Dianchi, one of the most eutrophicated lakes in China, has epitomized this issue. Clear understandings of phosphorus (P) mitigation efforts, the evolution of P budgets, and possible risks in the Dianchi system will benefit future eutrophication control, providing valuable lessons for other plateau freshwater lakes. In this study, we applied systematic review methodology to investigate the above questions, and then compared the results with other lakes worldwide. Generally, meta-analytical approaches have indicated P levels remain a key factor in causing algal blooms. Post-2015, the P budget of the Dianchi system, especially in Caohai section, was modified. However, it's still experiencing high pressures from P enrichment (Caohai: 0.4 mg.l(-1); Waihai: 0.2 mg.l(-1)). The flux of P in Dianchi remains high, both through the external P load (556 ton.a (1)), and an internal cycle (304 ton.a (1) associated with the absorption, deposition and removal of algae biomass; and 380 ton.a(-1) associated with sediment exchange). Meanwhile, significant P retention has been observed in the lake, in particular within the Waihai section (211 ton.a(-1)). Currently, water diversion (from external watersheds), sewage diversion, and sediment-dredging projects have benefited Dianchi. However, continuous urbanization and GPMn ecological degradation could introduce hundreds of tons of additional P, leading to subsequent algal blooms. Furthermore, beyond Lake Dianchi, other lakes and reservoirs in southwest China are facing similar issues regarding P mitigation, especially in GPMn regions, though corresponding knowledge is still limited. Therefore, effective and flexible sub-regional protection strategies and research related to external and internal P mitigations have become key requirements for Lake Dianchi management. Meanwhile, ecologically sensitive approaches to GPMn regions, as well as city development within basin and market driven treatments, should be incorporated into regional water source protection for southwest China.

AB  - Background
   The progress of Universal health coverage (UHC) is measured using tracer indicators of key interventions, which have been implemented in healthcare system. UHC is about population, comprehensive health services and financial coverage for equitable quality services and health outcome. There is dearth of evidence about the extent of the universality of UHC in terms of types of health services, its integrated definition (dimensions) and tracer indicators utilized in the measurement of UHC. Therefore, we mapped the existing literature to assess universality of UHC and summarize the challenges towards UHC.
   Methods
   The checklist Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews was used. A systematic search was carried out in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. Hand searches were also conducted to find articles from Google Scholar, the World Bank Library, the World Health Organization Library, the United Nations Digital Library Collections, and Google. Article search date was between 20 October 2021 and 12 November 2021 and the most recent update was done on 03 March 2022. Articles on UHC coverage, financial risk protection, quality of care, and inequity were included. The Population, Concept, and Context framework was used to determine the eligibility of research questions. A stepwise approach was used to identify and select relevant studies, conduct data charting, collation and summarization, as well as report results. Simple descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were used to present the findings.
   Results
   Forty-seven papers were included in the final review. One-fourth of the articles (25.5%) were from the African region and 29.8% were from lower-middle-income countries. More than half of the articles (54.1%) followed a quantitative research approach. Of included articles, coverage was assessed by 53.2% of articles; financial risk protection by 27.7%, inequity by 25.5% and quality by 6.4% of the articles as the main research objectives or mentioned in result section. Most (42.5%) of articles investigated health promotion and 2.1% palliation and rehabilitation services. Policy and healthcare level and cross-cutting barriers of UHC were identified. Financing, leadership/governance, inequity, weak regulation and supervision mechanism, and poverty were most repeated policy level barriers. Poor quality health services and inadequate health workforce were the common barriers from health sector challenges. Lack of common understanding on UHC was frequently mentioned as a cross-cutting barrier.
   Conclusions
   The review showed that majority of the articles were from the African region. Methodologically, quantitative research design was more frequently used to investigate UHC. Palliation and rehabilitation health care services need attention in the monitoring and evaluation of UHC progress. It is also noteworthy to focus on quality and inequity of health services. The study implies that urgent action on the identified policy, health system and cross-cutting barriers is required to achieve UHC.

AB  - Climate change is increasingly recognized as a threat to global peace and security. This paper intends to provide a better understanding of the nature of interactions between climate change and events that undermine peace through a systematic review of recent literature. It highlights major methodological approaches adopted in the literature, elaborates on the geographic focus of the research at the nexus of climate change and peace, and provides further information on how various climatic stressors, such as extreme temperature, floods, sea-level rise, storms, and water stress may be linked to different events that undermine peace (e.g. civil conflict, crime, intercommunal violence, interstate conflict, political conflict, and social conflict) through direct and indirect pathways. Results confirm previous findings that statistical techniques and qualitative case studies are dominant methods in climate-conflict research but show that there has been an increase in the geographic information system based risk analyses and qualitative comparative analyses in the recent years. In line with previous reviews, results show that the literature is mainly focused on certain regions of the world and several major regions that have experienced numerous conflicts over the past few years and/or are vulnerable to adverse climatic events are understudied. However, a new finding is that, in the past few years, there has been an increasing focus on Asia, which contrasts with previous reviews that show an African focus in the literature. Also, there is an unbalanced attention to different climatic stressors and peace-related events. Interactions between water stress/extreme temperature and civil and interstate conflicts have received more attention. A major finding is that, only under certain conditions climatic stressors may act as driving forces or aggravating factors. In fact, there is a strong consensus that climate change is less likely to undermine peace in isolation from a wide range of contextual socio-economic and institutional factors such as political instability, poor governance, poverty, homogeneous livelihood structures, and ethnic fractionalization. However, such contextual factors can contribute to undermining peace via either direct or indirect pathways. The former may occur through direct psychological/physiological effects of climatic impacts or via competition over scarce resources. In contrast, in indirect pathways climate change may lead to conflict through diminishing livelihood capacities and/or inducing migration. In addition to synthesizing literature on contextual factors and direct/indirect pathways, the review identifies gaps that need further research.

AB  - Background: Most health economic evaluations of childhood vaccination only capture the health and short-term economic benefits. Measuring broader, long-term effects of vaccination on productivity and externalities could provide a more complete picture of the value of vaccines.
   Method: MEDLINE, EconLit and NHS-EED databases were searched for articles published between January 1990 and July 2011, which captured broader economic benefits of vaccines in low and middle income countries. Studies were included if they captured at least one of the following categories on broader economic impact: outcome-related productivity gains, behaviour-related productivity gains, ecological externalities, equity gains, financial sustainability gains or macroeconomic benefits.
   Results: Twenty-six relevant studies were found, including observational studies, economic models and contingent valuation studies. Of the identified broader impacts, outcome-related productivity gains and ecological externalities were most commonly accounted for. No studies captured behaviour-related productivity gains or macroeconomic effects. There was some evidence to show that vaccinated children 8-14 years of age benefit from increased cognitive ability. Productivity loss due to morbidity and mortality was generally measured using the human capital approach. When included, herd immunity effects were functions of coverage rates or based on reduction in disease outcomes. External effects of vaccines were observed in terms of equitable health outcomes and contribution towards synergistic and financially sustainable healthcare programs.
   Conclusion: Despite substantial variation in the methods of measurement and outcomes used, the inclusion of broader economic impact was found to improve the attractiveness of vaccination. Further research is needed on how different tools and techniques can be used in combination to capture the broader impact of vaccination in a way that is consistent with other health economic evaluations. In addition, more country level evidence is needed from low and middle income countries to justify future investments in vaccines and immunization programs. Finally, the proposed broader economic impact framework may contribute towards better communication of the economic arguments surrounding vaccine uptake, leading to investments in immunization by stakeholders outside of the traditional health care sector such as ministries of finance and national treasuries.

AB  - PurposeThe first purpose of this paper is to investigate whether corporate governance mechanisms, in particular the characteristics of the board, audit committee and risk management committee, are associated with the level of disclosure in integrated reports of South African listed firms. The second purpose of this paper is to analyze how integrated reporting (IR) affects the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses a mixed methods approach. First, a multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on IR practices of a sample of South African listed firms during the period between 2019 and 2021. Using the content analysis method to measure the level of IR, disclosures were measured using a disclosure index consisting of 60 information items developed from the IIRC framework and previous studies. Second, based on a database containing 33 articles in the Meditari Accountancy Research journal with a publication date from 2013 to 2021, a systematic review of the academic literature focusing on IR is conducted to analyze how IR influences SDGs. FindingsThe results indicate that board size, board independence and risk management committee independence have a positive effect on IR practices. However, board expertise, board activity, audit committee independence, audit committee size, audit committee expertise, audit committee meetings, risk management committee expertise, risk management committee meetings, risk management committee size and the auditor type are negatively related to IR practices. The results also indicate that IR has an important role in achieving SDGs by relying on integrated thinking that integrates sustainability into the enterprise's strategy and helps the integration of capitals. In addition, sustainable business models create long-term values. Research limitations/implicationsThis study was limited to a sample size of 75 firms, which is country-specific; however, it sets the tone for future empirical research on the subject matter. This study provides an avenue for future research in the area of corporate governance and IR practices in other emerging countries, especially other African countries. Practical implicationsThis study provides useful insights for managers and policymakers to better understand which corporate governance mechanisms can best encourage a company to improve IR practices. Originality/valueTo the best of the author's knowledge, this study is, perhaps, the first to examine the effect of risk management committee characteristics on IR practices. This study provides new insight into the contribution of accounting research toward the achievement of SDGs.

AB  - Urban growth and intensification are projected to increase as the global human population increases. Historically, urban areas have been disregarded as suitable wildlife habitat, but it is now known that these areas can be biodiverse and that wildlife species can adapt to the environmental conditions. One such urban-dwelling species is the Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, which has suffered population declines in several countries throughout its range in recent decades. The current published literature was systematically reviewed to determine whether or not urban habitats are suitable refugia for red squirrels, through identifying and discussing key topics regarding the urban ecology of red squirrels. Urban environments can support higher population densities of red squirrels than rural areas, probably due to the widespread and reliable provision of anthropogenic supplemental food alongside natural food sources. The availability and quality of urban greenspaces are important determinants of the suitability of urban habitats for red squirrels, as they provide natural food sources and nesting sites. Despite the barriers present in urban landscapes (e.g. roads), red squirrels can still disperse and maintain gene flow at the population level. Road traffic accidents appear to be a significant cause of mortality in some urban red squirrel populations, and seasonal peaks of mortality occur during the autumn months. Diseases (e.g. squirrelpox virus) can also be a significant cause of mortality, although effects differ between populations and depend on whether grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are present. Many of the predation events that affect red squirrels appear to be due to free-ranging domestic and feral cats Felis catus, although there is currently little evidence to suggest that predation is a limiting factor for urban red squirrel populations. We conclude that urban areas can be suitable refugia for red squirrels, provided that high-quality greenspaces are maintained. Mitigation measures may also be necessary to reduce population mortality and to prevent disease outbreaks.

AB  - International literature on urban sprawl mainly emphasizes its environmental, social, and economic effects on urban areas. Many studies have dealt with the environmental effects of urban sprawl. However, the financial and economic consequences of this phenomenon are not yet clear. This study seeks to find the financial and economic consequences of urban sprawl on urban management. For this purpose, it uses an interpretive approach and a systematic Meta-synthesis method. Meta-synthesis is the systematic review and integration of findings from qualitative studies to form a new interpretation of the research field. The statistical population is the findings of other researchers in the field of urban sprawl in the period 1970-2022. The data were encoded and interpreted using MAXQDA software. MAXQDA is a qualitative research tool that can be used for coding and analyzing source materials. The results show that the financial and economic benefits of urban sprawl fall into seven categories: "real estate's income; business, sales and services; government grants and subsidies; reduction in security costs; reduction in the cost of environment and urban services; reduction in physical costs and urban development; and reduction in the cost of transportation and traffic. But the costs of urban sprawl include "social and cultural costs; transportation and traffic costs; physical and urban development costs; environmental and urban services costs; current and administrative services costs; security and emergency services costs". Most researchers have acknowledged that the sprawl costs far more than the financial and economic benefits to the city, with most of the costs being borne by the environment and urban services, as well as transportation and traffic. Regarding the benefits of urban sprawl, researchers have emphasized the benefits of real estate. In many cities around the world, including cities in developing countries, extensive urban land ownership, and physical assets mean that taxes and charges on them can significantly increase public revenues, which can continue to increase as urban productivity increases. It seems that until there is not a fundamental change in the financial structure of urban management; the growth of urban sprawl or expansion is inevitable.

AB  - Water Safety Plan (WSP) implementation has the potential to greatly improve, commonly very challenging and resource limited, small drinking water supplies. Although slower than in urban or high-income settings, the uptake of WSPs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is accelerating. Understanding the factors which will make a WSP successful will further improve efficient uptake and assist with its long-term sustainability. Based on an extensive literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISM-A) methodology, 48 publications, including case studies and guidance documentation, formed the basis of this review. These were analysed using inductive and deductive coding methods to (i) identify the success factors applicable to WSP implementation in small drinking water supplies in LMICs and (ii) to investigate which factors are more or less critical depending on the geography and level of development of the implementing country. Key challenges identified during the review process were also noted. A comparison of these success factors was made with those identified from high-income and urban settings. The three most important success factors identified are the development of technical capacity, community engagement, and monitoring and verification. Factors specific to small drinking water supplies in LMICs include support from non-government organisations, integration into existing water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs, simplicity, and community engagement. Certain factors, such as adaptability, the use of guidance documentation, international collaboration, the role of pilot studies, knowledge sharing, and stakeholder involvement are applicable to all WSP settings. Due to the specific challenges faced by small drinking water systems and the limited number of original research publications on this topic, this study highlights the need for further data collection and research focused on success factors in these settings. It is anticipated that the consideration of the success factors identified in this study will assist implementers in improving the uptake and long-term sustainability of WSPs in small drinking water supplies in low- and middle-income settings.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides huge potential for tracking progress towards conservation targets and goals, but SRS products need to be tailored towards the requirements of ecological users and policymakers. In this viewpoint article, we propose to advance SRS products with a terrestrial biodiversity focus for tracking the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF). Of 371 GBF biodiversity indicators, we identified 58 unique indicators for tracking the state of terrestrial biodiversity, spanning 2 goals and 8 targets. Thirty-six shared enough information to analyse their underlying workflows and spatial information products. We used the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) to connect spatial information products to different dimensions of biodiversity (e.g. species populations, species traits, and ecosystem structure), and then counted EBV usage across GBF goals and targets. Combined with published scores on feasibility, accuracy, and immaturity of SRS products , we identified a priority list of terrestrial SRS products representing opportunities for scientific development in the next decade. From this list, we suggest two key directions for advancing SRS products and workflows in the GBF context using current instruments and technologies. First, existing terrestrial ecosystem distributions and live cover fraction SRS products (of above-ground biomass, ecosystem fragmentation, ecosystem structural variance, fraction of vegetation cover, plant area index profile, and land cover) need to be refined using a co-design approach to achieve harmonized ecosystem taxonomies, reference states and improved thematic detail. Second, new SRS products related to plant physiology and primary productivity (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content & flux, foliar N/P/K content, and carbon cycle) need to be developed to better estimate plant functional traits, especially with deep learning techniques, radiative transfer models and multi-sensor frameworks. Advancements along these two routes could greatly improve the tracking of GBF target 2 ('improve connectivity of priority terrestrial ecosystems), target 3 ('ensure management of protected areas'), target 6 ('control the introduction and impact of invasive alien species'), target 8 ('minimize impact of climate change on biodiversity'), target 10 ('increase sustainable productivity of agricultural and forested ecosystems') and target 12 ('increase public urban green/blue spaces'). Such improvements can have secondary benefits for other EBVs, e.g. as predictor variables for modelling species distributions and population abundances (i.e. data that are required in several GBF indicators). We hope that our viewpoint stimulates the advancement of biodiversity monitoring from space and a stronger collaboration among ecologists, SRS scientists and policy experts.

AB  - Snow leopards and agropastoral communities have co-existed in snow leopard range countries for centuries. The vulnerable snow leopard forms and maintains the entire ecosystem, serving as an indicator species of a healthy alpine ecosystem. However, snow leopards, on the other hand, habitually kill livestock, occasionally killing 100 or more livestock in a single night, resulting in snow leopard retaliation. Thus, the snow leopard is becoming more threatened, so more attention should be paid. Therefore, numerous conservation mitigation strategies have been applied to maintain human-snow leopard coexistence in countries of the snow leopard range. However, such implemented conservation strategies lacked a thorough assessment of their achievements or shortcomings in protecting the snow leopard and enhancing community tolerance. Therefore, we systematically examined and evaluated peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on existing and implemented mitigation measures. We use the software Publish or Perish to achieve this, and we assess using the Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) review approach. We thoroughly analyzed 42 papers and book chapters that were condensed human-snow leopard co-existence-related literature published in English from 2010 to 2023. Almost 90% of the papers were country-specific, with the remaining papers covering regional or snow leopard ranges countries. Nepal had the most papers, followed by China, India, and Mongolia; however, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Pakistan, Russia, and Tajikistan each had<10%, but there was no single document from Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan. Predator-proof corral, improved herding practices, and community-based insurance programs were three of the key recommendations that were more than 10 to 22 times proposed interventions. There are site-specific sociocultural situations and environments that require long-term action-oriented research that is area-specific rather than short-term and generic interventions. We identified a large knowledge gap in snow leopard research, specifically a lack of evidence that demonstrates and quantifies the effects of conservation actions, and strongly advise that it be further researched.

AB  - Nowadays, sustainability issues are at most importance for the global world. The Agenda 2030 for sustainable development is the key strategy in this field. When sustainability issues are discussed, the most often topics relate to sustainable cities, sustainable supply chain, sustainable transportation etc. However, it must be noted that sustainability concerns to almost all the issues related to the functioning of enterprises, society, cities, etc. It also has an impact on the innovation activity of enterprises. Responsible innovations, eco-innovation, green innovations are the topics lately studied by scholars around the world. Thus, the study aims to identify the relationships between terms of innovations related to the environment and other research areas presented in the literature. For this purpose, the extensive literature revives of publications indexed in the WoS database has been provided. The main research questions are: How the relationships between the notions described a new direction of the research in the innovations area for the environment, are created? Is it possible to identify the only one kind of relationship between the keywords described the eco-innovations and other similar notions with other research areas? The conducted analyzes show that in the literature many different terms describing innovations created for the environment, can be identified. Although innovations that are safe for the environment are a relatively new topic, the number of publications identified in the WoS database and their dynamic growth confirms the importance of research conducted in this area. Therefore, it is necessary to organize the terminology used and indicate whether these terms and in what cases can be applied interchangeable. Research in this area will also be conducted by the authors of this article in the frame. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose-The academic literature and research lines exploring the effect of quality improvement methods on environmental performance still remain in early stages. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate, through a systematic review of the existing academic literature, the environmental (green) impact of using quality and operations improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma. This includes the impact on energy saving and the usage of natural resources.
   Design/ methodology/ approach-This study follows a systematic literature review approach through which it analyses research papers published in top 16 operations and quality management journals. No specific time frame was established, but a set of keywords were used to short-list the articles. A sample of 70 articles was finally short-listed and analysed to provide a discussion on environmental concerns related to Lean, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma.
   Findings-The comprehensive review of short-listed articles indicates that both Lean and Six Sigma can be considered effective methods to support the conservation of resources, combat global warming and saving energy. Various scholars provide evidence of this, and as such, organisations should not only consider these methods to manage quality and improve operational performance but also meet environmental regulations. A set of research questions that demands further investigation has also been proposed based on the findings of this research.
   Research limitations/ implications-This study is limited to a sample of 70 articles collected from top 16 operations and quality management journals. The search of journals is also limited to a set of key words (" Lean", " Green", " Six Sigma", " environment", " sustainable" and " sustainability") used to short-list the sample size.
   Practical implications-The study shows that organisations can consider the adoption of Lean, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma to meet environmental regulations, save costs and also meet quality management standards. This will contribute in helping organisations to formulate more effective and inclusive strategies which do not only consider the quality and operational dimensions but also the environmental dimension.
   Originality/ value-Literature exploring the environmental/ green impact of quality management methods commonly used in industry is limited. There is also a lack of studies aiming to investigate the green impact of Lean and Six Sigma in top operations and quality management journals. The study focusing on investigating the green impact of Lean, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma methods altogether is also a research first of its kind.

AB  - Food waste represents one of the major problems in the food industry, as it accounts for substantial social, economic, and environmental challenges due to the waste of resources along the food supply chain - such as waste of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Recovering food waste and transforming it into valuable products is essential to reduce the impacts of such losses. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a well-developed and standardized tool for evaluating the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout the supply chain. However, evaluating the impacts and benefits of different food waste valorization and recycling pathways requires a deeper understanding of the different types of substrates and their applications in the consequent supply chain stages. Moreover, in agri-food LCAs, inconsistencies are found regarding the different multifunctionality allocation approaches, especially in contexts where the differentiation between co-production and waste generation is unclear. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to reconcile the aforementioned inconsistencies by (1) analyzing the current practices on allocation decisions in agricultural and other food-related LCAs and (2) providing practical recommendations for decision-making regarding allocation methods for specific types of food co-products and waste streams following the ISO 14044 requirements. Results show that many LCA practitioners are adopting a zero-burden approach (40%) to model the valorization of biomass such as food co-products and/ or waste, even if these materials do not conform to the ISO 14044 definition of waste. Only consequential LCAs consistently applied an approach that adheres to the ISO 14044 allocation hierarchy. In attributional LCAs, economic allocation was found to be the most used approach (35%), followed by mass-based allocation (13%), suggesting that much of current practices are inconsistent with the ISO 14044 allocation hierarchy. The results also indicate that most LCA practitioners do not provide transparent justifications of their methodological choices, such as the definitions of co-products and wastes, cut-off criteria, and/or allocation procedures. Conclusively, the following criteria were identified as pertinent factors to consider when addressing to multifunctional food flows in LCA: the goal and scope of the study; a justified definition of the material flow type (coproduct/waste); the LCA modeling approach (attributional/consequential); the description of the multifunctional processes (upstream/downstream); and associated allocation methods (compliant with the ISO guidelines).

AB  - Worldwide, food waste is one of the prime issues threatening food security and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is not an exception. With 427 kg of food wasted per capita per year, the country ranks among the top food wasters. Ironically, the Kingdom has limited arable lands and scarce water resources to support mass-scale agriculture and to feed its increasing population, KSA relies heavily on imports and subsidized food to meet needs. Yet, food is wasted at restaurants, caterers, cafeterias and, especially, by households such that food waste is the single-largest component of the landfills. The review article is based on the grey and scientific literature published in the English and Arabic languages on the issue of food waste in Saudi Arabia. Information sources like Web of knowledge, online resources and the databases available through the King Saud University, Saudi Arabia were accessed and used to collect information on food waste, its social, cultural, economic and environmental impacts and related topics. Since food items and groceries are abundantly available to all living in KSA and they are highly subsidized, the residents take food for granted. According to a recent survey, about 78% of food purchased in KSA is discarded each week in order to make room for new groceries. The factors responsible for food waste include: lack of awareness; and insufficient and inappropriate planning when shopping. Food waste in restaurants, celebrations, social events and occasions are enormous. Waste is common in festivals and special events where the customs is to provide more food than required. There is a need to change society's food culture, particularly among the women and the youth, as they are largest segment of the society and the prime food wasters. The analysis of the factors responsible for food waste, identified in this article suggests a "Stop Wasting Food" campaign should be launched. It is also recommended to determine and activate the role of extension education to reduce food waste in the KSA through vibrant capacity building programs for youth and women, in particular, and society in general.

AB  - This consensus document is aimed at providing an updated, multidisciplinary overview on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric nephrotic syndrome (NS) at first presentation. It is the first consensus document of its kind to be produced by all the pediatric nephrology centres in Italy, in line with what is already present in other countries such as France, Germany and the USA. It is based on the current knowledge surrounding the symptomatic and steroid treatment of NS, with a view to providing the basis for a separate consensus document on the treatment of relapses. NS is one of the most common pediatric glomerular diseases, with an incidence of around 2-7 cases per 100000 children per year. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, but the optimal therapeutic regimen for managing childhood idiopathic NS is still under debate. In Italy, shared treatment guidelines were lacking and, consequently, the choice of steroid regimen was based on the clinical expertise of each individual unit. On the basis of the 2015 Cochrane systematic review, KDIGO Guidelines and more recent data from the literature, this working group, with the contribution of all the pediatric nephrology centres in Italy and on the behalf of the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, has produced a shared steroid protocol that will be useful for National Health System hospitals and pediatricians. Investigations at initial presentation and the principal causes of NS to be screened are suggested. In the early phase of the disease, symptomatic treatment is also important as many severe complications can occur which are either directly related to the pathophysiology of the underlying NS or to the steroid treatment itself. To date, very few studies have been published on the prophylaxis and treatment of these early complications, while recommendations are either lacking or conflicting. This consensus provides indications for the prevention, early recognition and treatment of these complications (management of edema and hypovolemia, therapy and prophylaxis of infections and thromboembolic events). Finally, recommendations about the clinical definition of steroid resistance and its initial diagnostic management, as well as indications for renal biopsy are provided.

AB  - The prevalence of pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD), including those receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), is increasing. Challenges associated with pain management in people with OUD include tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and risk for return to use. Yet, there are few evidence-based recommendations for pain management in the setting of pregnancy and the postpartum period, and many peripartum pain management studies exclude people with OUD. This scoping review summarized the available literature on peridelivery pain management in people with OUD, methodologies used, and identified specific areas of knowledge gaps. PubMed and Embase were comprehensively searched for publications in all languages on peripartum pain management among people with OUD, both treated with MOUD and untreated. Potential articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Data abstracted were descriptively analyzed to map available evidence and identify areas of limited or no evidence. A total of 994 publications were imported for screening on title, abstracts, and full text, yielding 84 publications identified for full review: 32 (38.1%) review articles, 14 (16.7%) retrospective studies, and 8 (9.5%) case reports. There were 5 randomized controlled trials. Most studies (64%) were published in perinatology (32; 38.1%) journals or anesthesiology (22; 26.2%) journals. Specific areas lacking trial or systematic review evidence include: (1) methods to optimize psychological and psychosocial comorbidities relevant to acute pain management around delivery; (2) alternative nonopioid and nonpharmacologic analgesia methods; (3) whether or not to use opioids for severe breakthrough pain and how best to prescribe and monitor its use after discharge; (4) monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation with coadministration of other analgesics; (5) optimal neuraxial analgesia dosing and adjuncts; and (6) benefits of abdominal wall blocks after cesarean delivery. No publications discussed naloxone coprescribing in the labor and delivery setting. We observed an increasing number of publications on peripartum pain management in pregnant people with OUD. However, existing published works are low on the pyramid of evidence (reviews, opinions, and retrospective studies), with a paucity of original research articles (<6%). Opinions are conflicting on the utility and disutility of various analgesic interventions. Studies generating high-quality evidence on this topic are needed to inform care for pregnant people with OUD. Specific research areas are identified, including utility and disutility of short-term opioid use for postpartum pain management, role of continuous wound infiltration and truncal nerve blocks, nonpharmacologic analgesia options, and the best methods to support psychosocial aspects of pain management.

AB  - The benefits of renewable energy are that it is sustainable and is low in environmental pollution. Growing load requirement, global warming, and energy crisis need energy-intensive management to give sincere attempts to promote high accuracy energy monitoring techniques in order to enhance energy system efficiency and performance. The energy consumption data of domestic, commercial and industrial are becoming accessible to estimate the notable share of various sectors in the energy market. Energy forecasting algorithms play a vital role in energy sector development and policy formulation. Energy prediction and power supply management are the key roots of energy planning. A large number of prediction models have been used in the recent past. The selection of a prediction model usually based on available data, the objectives of the model network mechanism and energy planning operation. In this review, we conduct a critical and systematic review of renewable energy and electricity prediction models applied as an energy planning tool. The forecasting intervals is divided into three sections including: i) short-term; ii) medium-term; iii) and long-term. Three renewable energy resources, i.e. wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and electricity load demand requirement are considered for review forecasting analysis. Three major states-of-art forecasting classifications: i) machine learning algorithms; ii) ensemble-based approaches; iii) and artificial neural networks are analyzed. These approaches are investigated for prediction applicability; accuracy for spatial and temporal forecasting; and relevance to policy and planning objectives. The machine learning models can handle large amount of data with accurate forecasting analysis. Applying ensemble techniques enables us to obtain higher forecasting accuracy by combining different models. Artificial neural networks if used in the right way can contribute a robust choice, given that it is capible to extract and model unseen relationships and features. Furthermore, unlike these conventional techniques, artificial neural networks do not force any limitation on residual and input distributions. Findings from this review would help professionals and researchers in obtaining recognition of the prediction approaches and allow them to choose the relevant methods to satisfy their desired tasks and forecasting requirements.

AB  - Agriculture is an important sector of the Moroccan economy, employing a huge portion of the Moroccan population and contributing about 14 - 20% to the country's GDP. Unfortunately, agricultural production in Morocco is impacted by climatic, non-climatic, biophysical, and non-biophysical stressors. Researchers have employed various crop models to understand how different crops respond to different environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, soil properties, fertilization, and irrigation. Unfortunately, there are no studies that provide a summary and a holistic perspective of the most frequently used models and their calibration inputs in Morocco. This work, therefore, seeks to fill these knowledge gaps by providing a summary of the most calibrated crop models, their calibration input data, the most frequently studied crops, how the studies are published (peerreview or grey literature), and the affiliations of the lead authors. This is achieved through a systematic review of the primary peer review and grey literature. A total of 68 relevant peer review and grey literature papers were considered. The results show that most of the authors are affiliated with Moroccan universities/organizations while wheat is the most studied crop. In addition, the AQUACROP and the regression-based models are the most used crop models. Additionally, most of the models are calibrated in order of importance with variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil properties, irrigation, and fertilizers. On the other hand, there is an observed increase in the use of non-climatic indicators such as poverty, farm income, and literacy levels to fit empirical models. It is still unclear how process-based models will integrate socio-economic indicators. This work has implications for future research as it provides a holistic picture of the key models that are currently used and their calibration.

AB  - The amount of coal gangue, a by-product of coal mining and washing, is rapidly increasing with the growing trend of energy consumption. The accumulated coal gangue without appropriate utilization has resulted in a squander of resources, waste disposal and environmental pollution issues. Over the past few decades, there has been wide attention in developing strategies for the utilization of coal gangue due to a cultural shift towards sustainable development coupled with increasing demand for disposing the challenge of coal gangue accumulation. However, to our knowledge, there is no thorough and in-depth review on the series address of coal gangue reuse. In spite of some advantages of using coal gangue, it is notable that negative environmental problems cannot be ignored, so the scientific utilization is necessary to control the environmental impacts. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of coal gangue utilization in building material production, energy generation, soil improvement and other high-added applications, analyze the worldwide dynamics of the studies on coal gangue utilization and identify the potential environmental risks in various pathways. The key focus of the review is on detecting the potential problems and thus giving recommendations for the solution. In addition, based on the progress of previous research, this paper also points the directions for further research within the field. A bibliometric analysis was developed in China National Knowledge Internet and Web of Science and a systematic review was conducted for related 237 articles to understand the physicochemical properties and utilization characteristics of coal gangue as well as corresponding environmental risks. The results indicated that the number of published articles has increased in recent years, and the researches were mainly from China, with the contribution of 78.94% of the total selected publications. Besides, these researches mainly focused on the utilization of coal gangue, while there was a lack of attention to environmental risks. The findings of the present study open up a new gate for the further application in coal gangue, hopefully motivate future relevant studies and guide the policy-making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land system reform (LSR) helps to protect farmers' rights and interests and national food security. China is a country dominated by agriculture but insufficient arable land resources. The contradiction between man and land is prominent. To alleviate the man-land contradiction, the Chinese government has carried out a series of LSRs, especially in the past half century. Extensive and in-depth studies have been done on the process and stage characteristics of China's LSRs, but the systematic analysis on the necessity, problems and key measures to deepen the land system reform is still insufficient. Based on a systematic review of the history of the evolution of China's LSRs, this study firstly analyzed the key issues and new challenges existing in or arising from China's land system, then put forward the necessity of deepening the reform of land system, and discussed specific measures taken to deepen the reform of land system in China at present and finally pointed out the future LSR's direction. The results show that China's rural ISR has gone through five stages in general since 1949. The key problems existing or arising from the current land system in China include unclear subject of land property right, serious inefficient utilization of land resources, rapid farmland conversion and conflict between farmers' interests and land system. The dual land system in urban and rural areas has severely restricted the integration of social and economic development in this country. The Chinese government is actively promoting the reforms of rural agricultural land, collective operating construction land and homestead to further remove the dual institutional barriers that hinder the establishment of an integrated land trading market. The vision is good, but there is still a long way to go for China's LSR. The direction of China's rural LSR is to make the property rights relationship clearer, the farmland rights more complete, the transfer transactions more market-oriented and the property rights' protection more equal. Deepening the rural LSRs is helpful to improve the efficiency of land resource utilization, safeguard the rights and interests of farmers, promote the coordination of human-land relationship, and inject new vitality and momentum into rural revitalization. Cooperative promotion of land resource capitalization reform and household registration system reform is the key area of land system reform in China in the future.

AB  - According to the UN-FAO, agricultural production must increase by 50% by 2050 to meet global demand for food. This goal can be accomplished, in part, by the development of improved cultivars coupled with modern best management practices. Overall, wheat production on farms will have to increase significantly to meet future demand, and in the face of a changing climate that poses risk to even current rates of production. Durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.)] is used largely for pasta, couscous and bulgur production. Durum producers face a range of factors spanning abiotic (frost damage, drought, and sprouting) and biotic (weed, disease, and insect pests) stresses that impact yields and quality specifications desired by export market end-users. Serious biotic threats include Fusarium head blight (FHB) and weed pest pressures, which have increased as a result of herbicide resistance. While genetic progress for yield and quality is on pace with common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), development of resistant durum cultivars to FHB is still lagging. Thus, successful biotic and abiotic threat mitigation are ideal case studies in Genotype (G) x Environment (E) x Management (M) interactions where superior cultivars (G) are grown in at-risk regions (E) and require unique approaches to management (M) for sustainable durum production. Transformational approaches to research are needed in order for agronomists, breeders and durum producers to overcome production constraints. Designing robust agronomic systems for durum demands scientific creativity and foresight based on a deep understanding of constitutive components and their innumerable interactions with each other and the environment. This encompasses development of durum production systems that suit specific agro-ecozones and close the yield gap between genetic potential and on-farm achieved yield. Advances in individual technologies (e.g., genetic improvements, new pesticides, seeding technologies) are of little benefit until they are melded into resilient G x E x M systems that will flourish in the field under unpredictable conditions of prairie farmlands. We explore how recent genetic progress and selected management innovations can lead to a resilient and transformative durum production system.

AB  - Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however, it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV) transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and future research directions related to the integration of blockchain technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b) we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory areas.

AB  - Background: The precipitous closure of rural maternity services in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and internationally has demanded a reevaluation of how to meet the perinatal surgical needs of rural women in accordance with the Triple Aim objectives of safety, cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction of all key stakeholders. There is emerging international evidence that General Practitioners with Enhanced Surgical Skills (GPESS) are a well-positioned health service solution due to their generalist nature in low-volume settings. A realist review was undertaken to evaluate international evidence on efficacious models of perinatal surgical care. This article presents findings of the safety of such practice, one discrete part of the full realist review.
   Methods: This paper was derived from a larger review, which used a realist review methodology to guide the approach, and adhered to the RAMESES quality standard for realist reviews. Seven academic databases were searched in December 2013, using year (1990) and language (English) limiters in keeping with a rapid review approach. Mining of bibliographies in addition to consultation with international experts led to further inclusion of academic and grey literature up to March 2014.
   Results: Two hundred fifty-four articles were originally identified; 119 articles were removed from consideration for lack of fit, resulting in the review of 191 articles from the peer reviewed and grey literature. Of these, 53 pertained to safety and are considered herein. Evidence on the safety of GPESS was consistent in the literature cited. Clinical, case study, and qualitative evidence demonstrates that perinatal surgical care is equally safe when provided by GPESS and specialist physicians.
   Conclusion: Findings allow health planners to confidently build perinatal surgical services around the contribution of GPs with enhanced surgical skills and focus on educational, regulatory, and continuing professional development mechanisms to ensure their sustainability. Volume-to-outcomes associations are variable and inconclusive with regards to safety, suggesting the need for more evidence. These findings, and the attendant health services planning directions, are reassuring as they suggest the viability of local models of care where feasible.

AB  - Given the prevailing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and the growing demand for renewable resources, the pavement industry, among others, is actively engaged in researching and exploring low-carbon materials and technologies. Despite the growing interest in low-carbon asphalt pavement, there is still a significant knowledge gap regarding the use of various waste materials and technologies to achieve this goal. This study aims to close this gap by conducting a systematic review and scientometric assessment of the existing studies on the use of waste materials and technologies for low-carbon asphalt pavement. The study spans the years 2008 to 2023, and the scientometric analysis was conducted using the VOS viewer application. The study identifies materials and technologies in this area by examining co-authored country studies, publication sources, and keyword co-occurrence. It should be noted that a limited number of waste materials that allow CO2 emissions reduction was analyzed in this study. However, other waste categories, such as bio-oils and polymers, which can provide positive either environmental or economic impacts on the production of paving materials, were not considered in the scope of the study. Based on the current review, it was found that integrating recycled waste materials like recycled asphalt pavement, biochar, or crumb rubber with alternative mixing technologies such as warm mix asphalt and cleaner energy can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. China and the United States were identified as key research contributors to the low-carbon pavement. Furthermore, biomass-based fuel and electric construction equipment lower carbon and greenhouse gas emissions by 36-90% and 67-95%, respectively. However, before various recycled waste materials and technologies can be widely used in the asphalt industry, various challenges need to be addressed, including cost concerns, performance and durability concerns, standardization and regulations, availability, integration with existing facilities, and insufficient field and long-term data. The review identified critical research gaps, such as the absence of a homogeneous and reliable standard method for low-carbon asphalt pavement, limited field performance data, and a life cycle assessment approach in analyzing the emission reduction effects. The reviews will aid in the paradigm shift to a more carbon-friendly pavement industry that uses recycled waste materials and technologies.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to conduct a critical systematic review of the available literature on the clinical and economic burden of bladder cancer in developed countries, with a focus on the cost effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing that burden.
   Forty-four economic studies were included in the review. Because of long-term survival and the need for lifelong routine monitoring and treatment, the cost per patient of bladder cancer from diagnosis to death is the highest of all cancers, ranging from $US96 000-187 000 (2001 values) in the US. Overall, bladder cancer is the fifth most expensive cancer in terms of total medical care expenditures, accounting for almost $US3.7 billion (2001 values) in direct costs in the US.
   Screening for bladder cancer in the general population is currently not recommended. The economic value of relatively new and less expensive urine assays and molecular urinary tumour markers has not been assessed. However, the literature suggests that screening patients suspected of having bladder cancer and using less invasive diagnostic procedures is cost effective.
   Very few cost-effectiveness studies have evaluated intravesical therapies such as bacillus Calmette-Guerin and mitomycin in the management of superficial disease and no robust recommendations can be drawn. Economic analyses suggest that non-surgical treatment strategies for the management of invasive disease aiming at bladder preservation may not be cost effective, because they have not consistently demonstrated survival benefits and do not eliminate the need for subsequent radical cystectomy.
   The literature suggests that the current conventional frequent follow-up and monitoring of patients can be cost effectively replaced by less frequent and less invasive monitoring, and should rely more heavily on intravesical chemotherapy to reduce the need for cystoscopies.
   Bladder cancer is a fairly common and costly malignancy. Nevertheless, the existing literature only contributes marginally to our knowledge concerning the burden of bladder cancer and the economic value of various interventions. The limited value of the literature in this area may be attributed to (i) being published as abstracts rather than full peer-reviewed evaluations; (ii) employing questionable methodologies; and (iii) being in many cases nearly obsolete, rendering them less relevant to, if not in conflict with, current clinical practice. Consequently, opportunities exist to conduct meaningful economic research in all areas of the management of bladder cancer, including screening, diagnosis, follow-up and treatment, especially with respect to new and innovative pharmaceutical and other technologies.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are digitally saved health records that provide information about a person's health. EHRs are generally shared among healthcare stakeholders, and thus are susceptible to power failures, data misuse, a lack of privacy, security, and an audit trail, among other problems. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a groundbreaking technology that provides a distributed and decentralized environment in which nodes in a list of networks can connect to each other without the need for a central authority. It has the potential to overcome the limits of EHR management and create a more secure, decentralized, and safer environment for exchanging EHR data. Further, blockchain is a distributed ledger on which data can be stored and shared in a cryptographically secure, validated, and mutually agreed-upon manner across all mining nodes. The blockchain stores data with a high level of integrity and robustness, and it cannot be altered. When smart contracts are used to make decisions and conduct analytics with machine-learning algorithms, the results may be trusted and unquestioned. However, Blockchain is not always indestructible and suffers from scalability and complexity issues that might render it inefficient. Combining AI and blockchain technology can handled some of the drawbacks of these two technical ecosystems effectively. AI algorithms rely on data or information to learn, analyze, and reach conclusions. The performance of AI algorithms is enhanced through the data obtained from a data repository or a reliable, secure, trustworthy, and credible platform. Researchers have identified three categories of blockchain-based potential solutions for the management of electronic health records: conceptual, prototype, and implemented. The purpose of this research work is to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and assess research articles that were either conceptual or implemented to manage EHRs using blockchain technology. The study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the literature on blockchain technology and enhanced health record management systems utilizing artificial intelligence technologies. The study examined 189 research papers collected from various publication categories. The in-depth analysis focuses on the privacy, security, accessibility, and scalability of publications. The SLR has illustrated that blockchain technology has the potential to deliver decentralization, security, and privacy that are frequently lacking in traditional EHRs. Additionally, the outcomes of the extensive analysis inform future researchers about the type of blockchain to use in their research. Additionally, methods used in healthcare are summarized per application area while their pros and cons are highlighted. Finally, the emphasized taxonomy combines blockchain and artificial intelligence, which enables us to analyze possible blockchain and artificial intelligence applications in health records management systems. The article ends with a discussion on open issues for research and future directions.

AB  - Large carnivores in Italy and other European countries are protected by law to ensure their long-term conservation. Estimates of abundance and demographic trends of their populations are crucial for implementing effective conservation and management strategies. However, it is challenging to obtain basic demographic parameters for elusive species such as the wolf (Canis lupus). Monitoring wolf populations by standard field methods or non-invasive genetic approaches requires huge human efforts and may be exceedingly expensive on a nation-wide scale. Aiming to obtain a first approximate estimate of wolf distribution and abundance in Italy, we developed a systematic review procedure to analyze published data obtained from a variety of sources. We deduced relevant information on wolf presence and numbers from 20 peer-reviewed studies or official reports, and from 241 Standard Data Forms of Natura 2000 sites in Italy, referring to the period 2009-2013. We estimated the species abundance by combining the number of individuals reported in each study area with the values obtained by multiplying the estimated number of packs for the average pack size. Comparing our estimates with those previously reported, we evaluated the qualitative trend of the population for each of the two management units: Alps and Apennines. Results showed the occurrence of approximately 321 wolf packs in Italy, corresponding to 12691800 wolves, possibly still underestimated. The Apennine sub-population seems to be almost the double in size (with ca. 1212-1711 wolves in the period 2009-2013) compared to previous estimates (600-800 wolves between 2006 and 2011). The Alpine sub-population, despite its ongoing eastwards expansion, appears rather stable (with 57-89 wolves). Overall, the current wolf population size and trends seem favorable, although the species is still locally threatened by widespread poaching and accidents. These results represent the first estimate of abundance for the whole Italian wolf population in the last 40 years. Such information can be used to implement sound conservation strategies, especially in critical human-dominated landscapes, where conflicts with human activities and increasing rates of hybridization with free-ranging domestic dogs call for updated management plans.

AB  - Cattle graze approximately 30% of global land, making their interactions with Earth's social and ecological systems of critical importance. Cattle have experienced a long process of evolution and domestication. Certain breeds are more adapted to specific environments, differentially affecting those breeds' impact on the envi-ronment, their interaction with ecosystems experiencing climate change impacts, and their capacity to provide goods and landscape management services. Emerging evidence suggests that, compared to more artificially selected conventional breeds, some less specialized, or 'heritage' beef cattle breeds exhibit unique foraging behaviors that could support desired outcomes such as biodiversity or climate change adaptation. We provide a novel, systematic characterization of breed-based behavioral differences to assist researchers and beef producers in selecting breed-based management strategies for achieving adaptation goals. We conducted a systematic search of studies that compared beef cattle breeds for behavioral trends, and found 54 studies conducted between 1966 and present day, located in 9 of the 14 major terrestrial world biomes, with 60 beef or dual-purpose breeds represented. We created a typology of the studies with respect to decade, continent, breed provenance (Conti-nental, Criollo, Hybrid, B. indicus, Mediterranean, Sanga, British Isles), breed selection intensity (heritage, conventional, hybrid), biome, study intent, and whether breeds met desired outcomes described by the study authors. Most studies (69%) were conducted in arid rangeland settings in developed nations where researchers sought to minimize the environmental impacts of beef production. In comparisons of grazing behavior of heritage versus conventional types (n = 25 studies), and hybrid versus conventional types (n = 18 studies), heritage and hybrid displayed more adapted traits (e.g., better grazing distribution) in 88% and 78% of the studies, respec-tively. No differences were found in grazing behaviors among most studies wherein heritage breeds were compared to other heritage breeds or conventional with conventional (n = 6 and 15 studies, respectively). In the subset of studies coded with the intent of "foraging behavior," heritage types traveled faster across a range of pasture sizes, suggesting a lighter environmental footprint and adaptive capacity to heat impacts. Overall, our review suggests that locally derived breeds display grazing behaviors that demonstrate adaptation to their respective native environments and may help producers meet production goals in similar environments. We conclude that breeds with more natural selection tend to exhibit less rigid grazing behaviors, which is a necessary coping strategy in variable climates and locales with heterogeneous forage availability, both of which are increasingly common scenarios caused by climate change.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to present a systematic review of the development process of Industry 4.0 in the textile and apparel sector, as well as to show some concepts, examples found in the literature on the application of the principles and technologies involved like the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data, autonomous robots, three-dimensional (3D) printing, augmented reality, virtual prototyping, horizontal and vertical system integration and cybersecurity. Design/methodology/approach The methodology adopted in this study was a systematic literature review aided by the use of SciMAT, a scientific mapping software. Documents were collected from the Web of Science and Scopus database from 2011 to 2020 using the words "Textile" and "Industry 4.0" that result in 865 documents and 115 were analyzed. Findings The literature review showed that the textile industry in the international context is at an incipient stage of the implementation of Industry 4.0. The main aspects of Industry 4.0 that were identified in the textile industry initially focus on the implementation of technologies aimed at computerization and automation of processes, whose main focuses are increasing productivity and reducing costs. Projects for the implementation of augmented reality and 3D printing and simulation technologies in the textile industry, clothing and apparel area are still embryonic, normally implemented through tools and software oriented toward the creation and development of new models of processes, products and commerce. Research limitations/implications The search in the databases was carried out on October 17, 2020. Therefore, for future study, other combinations of search terms and time update are suggested, in addition to including more databases besides Scopus and Web of Science. Practical implications This literature review served as the basis for the development of a questionnaire that was applied to 72 people in an industry in the clothing sector, located in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Social implications The benefits of industry 4.0 are perceived in people with its implementation, such as a reduction in energy consumption of around 15%, an increase of up to 25% in work efficiency, in addition to more assertive decision-making, improvement of processes and balance between life and work. Originality/value Machine learning, artificial intelligence, smart fabrics, IoT, supply chain management, environmental protection, Big Data, autonomation and cyber physics were the strongest terms found, consolidating as a prominent field for current and future studies. From emerging and/or still unexplored areas of Industry 4.0 in the textile sector, there is real-time communication, computer applications, carbon, fibers, health care and sustainable development. Some strategic actions that are taking place in some countries are summarized and in Brazil the adoption rate is 29% for this sector, revealing itself as a needy area and suitable for the development of studies that address the subject.

AB  - BackgroundIndigenous populations in Canada and the United States (US) have maintained reciprocal relationships with nature, grounded in respect for and stewardship of the environment; however, disconnection from traditional food systems has generated a plethora of physical and mental health challenges for communities. Indigenous food sovereignty including control of lands were found to be factors contributing to these concerns. Therefore, our aim was to conduct a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature to describe Indigenous disconnection from Indigenous food systems (IFS) in Canada and the US.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-SR) and Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, and Bibliography of Native North Americans. Data was extracted from 41 studies and a narrative review completed based on study themes.ResultsThe overarching theme identified in the included studies was the impact of colonization on IFS. Four sub-themes emerged as causes for Indigenous disconnection from traditional food systems, including: climate change; capitalism; legal change; and socio-cultural change. These sub-themes highlight the multiple ways in which colonization has impacted Indigenous food systems in Canada and the US and important areas for transformation.ConclusionsEfforts to reconnect Indigenous knowledge and values systems with future food systems are essential for planetary health and sustainable development. Traditional knowledge sharing must foreground authentic Indigenous inclusion within policymaking.
   center dot The main theme identified amongst the SR literature was the lasting impacts of colonization on Indigenous food systems in Canada and the US, which is described through four key areas: climate change; capitalism; legal changes; and socio-cultural changes.center dot Less than 20% of included papers report author positionality, with only 7% of included papers reporting Indigenous authorship, emphasizing an opportunity for more reporting and Indigenous engagement in the future.center dot Loss of cultural knowledge and practices was highlighted by many articles reviewed.center dot Revitalisation of IFS must include authentic Indigenous engagement, support Indigenous knowledge frameworks, community sharing networks, education programs and co-management.

AB  - Purpose - Although well established in North America and Europe, the study of supply chain management (SCM) is still at a relatively early stage in its development in China. The transformation and rapid growth of the Chinese economy has, nevertheless, created major supply chain challenges for the country making SCM a very fertile area of business research. In Western countries, research on SCM is now mature and underpinned by a solid body of theory. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which research on SCM in China has also developed a theoretical basis.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research involved a systematic review of 150 papers published in 18 journals in the fields of SCM, logistics, operations management and marketing during the period 2004-2014. A three-step process was adopted to select appropriate journals, identify relevant articles and classify them in terms of their theoretical content.
   Findings - The study has confirmed that, because of its unique economic, political and cultural setting, supply chain development in China has presented new research challenges. Many examples were found of researchers conducting quasi-experiments to test the applicability of established theories to Chinese supply chains while others have tried to develop new ones that are more closely aligned with the Chinese economy and management practices. Researchers have exhibited a heavy reliance on existing theories, with relatively few attempting to customise them to the Chinese context or to construct new ones.
   Research limitations/implications - Given the broad scope of SCM, it is possible that the journal and paper selection processes have accidentally screened out relevant papers. The total sample of papers is, nevertheless, large for an explorative study of this type and should, therefore, give an overall impression of the level of theory development in Chinese SCM research.
   Practical implications - This study provides a general framework within which to assess the application and development of theories in the Chinese SCM context. It is principally concerned with three components: the SCM phenomena studied, the Chinese business environment and the theoretical contribution of the research. The paper is targeted more at an academic audience than practitioners, though provides an overview of the research so far undertaken on SCM in China that should be of wider interest.
   Originality/value - This study is the first of its kind to review China-based SCM research systematically from the perspective of theory development. It should support the evolution of SCM theory not only in China but also more generally.

AB  - Background: In this paper we review the conservation genetics of African savannah elephants, aiming to understand the spatio-temporal research trends and their underlying factors. As such, we explore three questions associated to the conservation genetics and molecular ecology of these elephants: (1) what are the research trends concerning the conservation genetics of Loxodonta africana? (2) Do richer countries conduct more research on the genetics of African elephants? (3) Which attributes influence where scholars conduct their research?
   Materials and Methods: We examined available peer-reviewed publications from 1993 to 2014 in complementary online databases, including the ISI/Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar (GS), and searched for publications in scientific journals as well as in the reference section of these publications. We analyzed the annual trend of publications in this field of research, including the number of authors, levels of collaboration among authors, year of publication, publishing journal and the countries from where genetic samples were collected. Additionally, we identified main research clusters, authors, and institutional collaborations, based on co-citation and co-occurrence networks.
   Results: We found that during the study period there was a positive trend in the number of publications and a reduction in the number of authors per paper. Twenty-five countries contributed, with the majority of publications authored by researchers in the USA, Kenya and South Africa. The majority of samples were collected in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa. Research outputs are associated with the existence of long-term conservation/research projects and research potential as measured by the literacy rate and the number of higher education institutions in a country. Five research clusters were identified, focusing on the origin and evolution of the species, methodological issues and the relatedness among elephant species.
   Conclusions: Research in this field should be expanded to additional countries harboring elephant populations to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the population structure and genetic differentiation of the species, and to cope with challenges associated with the conservation of the species such as illegal hunting, habitat fragmentation, species reintroduction and climate change.

AB  - The growing amount of tannery sludge (TS) generated from leather processing often undergoes uncontrolled landfilling, or open dumping, releasing a significant volume of harmful pollutants, including carcinogenic chromium (Cr) into the air, water, and soil. Therefore, the sustainable TS management through advanced valorization technologies becomes vital to align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and mitigate the adverse environmental, health, and social impacts. Moreover, TS, as biomass, can be considered a renewable energy source for bioenergy generation, which could be a viable solution for meeting contemporary environmental standards and expediting transition towards a circular economy. However, TS valorization is sensitive and critical due to the potential risk of transforming Cr(III) to Cr(VI) during the valorization process. Therefore, there is an urgency to consider efficient and holistic TS valorization technologies in the design, implementation, and operations phases to avoid any environmental and health hazards. In pursuit of this goal, this systematic literature review (SLR) comprehensively and critically analyzes the existing TS valorization processes to develop sustainable energy recovery solutions from TS. This SLR contributes uniquely to the existing literature in different ways. Firstly, it provides a critical evaluation of the current TS valorization technologies identifying the available waste-to-energy recovery options. Secondly, the review encompasses extensive research from three reputed databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, without temporal restrictions to offer a comprehensive understanding of current TS management practices and available valorization techniques. Moreover, the review categorized 124 published papers into distinct groups, revealing promising avenues for future research in this field. The findings indicated that most of the work concentrating on Chrome (Cr) recovery, pyrolysis, anaerobic co-digestion, and solidification while gasification and biodiesel or biofuel production from TS remained largely unexplored. Additionally, vital aspects such as process optimization, life cycle assessment of different valorization techniques, environmental, economy, energy, emergy, and exergy (5E) analysis, life cycle energy balance, and techno-economic analysis including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental are completely absent in the literature. Future studies need to concentrate on process optimization, exergy and energy analysis, and techno-economic assessment including exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analysis to understand the feasibility and environmental benefits of various TS valorization technologies and to develop industry-scale valorization plants for TS management in an economically and ecologically sustainable manner. Moreover, the review will serve as a comprehensive guide for scholars, authorities, and stakeholders to advance research in this field and formulate policies for the eco-friendly management of TS, paving the way towards clean energy solutions.

AB  - Helminth infections are ubiquitous in grazing ruminant production systems, and are responsible for significant costs and production losses. Anthelmintic Resistance (AR) in parasites is now widespread throughout Europe, although there are still gaps in our knowledge in some regions and countries. AR is a major threat to the sustainability of modern ruminant livestock production, resulting in reduced productivity, compromised animal health and welfare, and increased greenhouse gas emissions through increased parasitism and farm inputs. A better understanding of the extent of AR in Europe is needed to develop and advocate more sustainable parasite control approaches. A database of European published and unpublished AR research on gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) was collated by members of the European COST Action "COMBAR" (Combatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants), and combined with data from a previous systematic review of AR in GIN. A total of 197 publications on AR in GIN were available for analysis, representing 535 studies in 22 countries and spanning the period 1980-2020. Reports of AR were present throughout the European continent and some reports indicated high within-country prevalence. Heuristic sample size-weighted estimates of European AR prevalence over the whole study period, stratified by anthelmintic class, varied between 0 and 48%. Estimated regional (country) prevalence was highly heterogeneous, ranging between 0% and 100% depending on livestock sector and anthelmintic class, and generally increased with increasing research effort in a country. In the few countries with adequate longitudinal data, there was a tendency towards increasing AR over time for all anthelmintic classes in GIN: aggregated results in sheep and goats since 2010 reveal an average prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles (BZ) of 86%, macrocyclic lactones except moxidectin (ML) 52%, levamisole (LEV) 48%, and moxidectin (MOX) 21%. All major GIN genera survived treatment in various studies. In cattle, prevalence of AR varied between anthelmintic classes from 0-100% (BZ and ML), 0-17% (LEV) and 0-73% (MOX), and both Cooperia and Ostertagia survived treatment. Suspected AR in F. hepatica was reported in 21 studies spanning 6 countries. For GIN and particularly F. hepatica, there was a bias towards preferential sampling of individual farms with suspected AR, and research effort was biased towards Western Europe and particularly the United Kingdom. Ongoing capture of future results in the live database, efforts to avoid bias in farm recruitment, more accurate tests for AR, and stronger appreciation of the importance of AR among the agricultural industry and policy makers, will support more sophisticated analyses of factors contributing to AR and effective strategies to slow its spread.

AB  - Background: A regular supply of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to agriculture is needed for global food security, and increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural-urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and capture some of its energetic value via biogas production. Anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, both energy and nutrient recovery can be achieved. Two promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from different types of wastewater are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. This review examined the effectiveness of these ecotechnologies for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment.
   Methods: We searched for academic and grey literature published after 2013. Searches were performed in 5 bibliographic databases in English, in the search engine Google Scholar in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish, and across a range of organisational websites in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish. Eligibility screening was conducted at two levels: 'title and abstract' and 'full text'. Included eligible studies were subject to a critical appraisal that assessed external and internal study validity. We extracted information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis included narrative synthesis of each study of sufficient validity. We performed quantitative synthesis on a subset of studies.
   Review findings: The review included 30 studies on struvite precipitation and 8 studies on ammonia stripping. Both pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were found to have a clear influence on the effectiveness of struvite precipitation process (and thus nutrient removal rates). The response to pH was found to be non-linear, resembling a bell curve with a maximum around pH 9.5. Mg:PO4 ratio was found to have a positive effect on removal up to a ratio as high as 4:1. However, it should be noted that high removal efficiencies were sometimes achieved at a ratio as low as 1:1 as well. Although the effects of pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were clear, the model developed could not accurately predict removal based on these two parameters alone. Studies on ammonia stripping were relatively heterogeneous. Due to the small size of the evidence base, and the heterogeneity between studies, no conclusions are presented regarding the influence of different process parameters on the outcome of ammonia stripping.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, when performed under the right conditions (i.e. pH around 9.5 and Mg:PO4 ratio of at least 1:1), available evidence suggests that struvite precipitation is an effective technology for the recovery of nutrients from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. The evidence base is limited for ammonia stripping. We provided suggestions of which data to report in future studies.

AB  - This is a systematic review for designing a conceptual model of the reinforcement factors and the inhibitors of the success of using virtual project teams among geographical and /or organizational dispersed teams. The GCC have common traditions and cultural aspects. The study is trying to answer one main question about the challenges and opportunities for success for depending on virtual project teams in managing GCC projects. Two sub-questions are derived from the main question: what factors do GCC countries have to make virtual project teams succeed? What benefits and obstacles the managers of virtual project teams may have in GCC countries zone? In the first part of this paper, the researchers are analyzing critically the state of the art literature in the field of virtual project teams. In the second part of this paper, the researchers are comparing the findings of previous researches with the GCC published reports issued by official organizations. The objective of this study is to come up with recommendations about the future practical research variables that measure the success or failure of virtual project teams in the GCC context. Researchers discussed challenges like resources allocation and decentralization of responsibility as well as opportunities for success like having better cost controlled projects and more efficient time management. The purpose of the study is to design a tailored customized conceptual model for the context of GCC to conceptualize the possible positive and negative relationships that determine the potential of success of VPT in this region. The problem of the research is a scarcity problem. It is focused on the scarcity of research contribution to the conceptualization of a model for VPM succession however; the documents reveal that there is a real need for VPM in general and especially for the GCC region. The solution to this problem in this research is represented in the generation of a new model which is customized to the characteristics of GCC and how these characteristics are related in a way that motivates further virtual cooperation and succession. The paper provides conceptualization of possible relationships between number of major constructs like efficiency of virtual communication and coordination, cultural re-approchement, and the cost of VPT functioning. The economic and political instability of the GCC environment is a real motive to use the results of this study for further investigation on the potential of success VPT in GCC.

AB  - Background
   The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.
   Objectives
   The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.
   Search methods
   The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.
   Selection criteria
   Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.
   Main results
   In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H-2-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H(2)RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H(2)RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations.
   For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations.
   Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H(2)RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.
   Authors' conclusions
   Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

AB  - Background There are great disparities in the quantity and quality of infrastructure. European countries such as Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK have close to 200 km of road per 100 km(2), and the Netherlands over 300 km per 100 km(2). By contrast, Kenya and Indonesia have <30, Laos and Morocco <20, Tanzania and Bolivia <10, and Mauritania only 1 km per 100 km(2). As these figures show, there is a significant backlog of transport infrastructure investment in both rural and urban areas, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This situation is often exacerbated by weak governance and an inadequate regulatory framework with poor enforcement which lead to high costs and defective construction. The wellbeing of many poor people is constrained by lack of transport, which is called "transport poverty". Lucas et al. suggest that up to 90% of the world's population are transport poor when defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: (1) lack of available suitable transport, (2) lack of transport to necessary destinations, (3) cost of necessary transport puts household below the income poverty line, (4) excessive travel time, or (5) unsafe or unhealthy travel conditions. Objectives The aim of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to identify, map, and describe existing evidence from studies reporting the quantitative effects of transport sector interventions related to all means of transport (roads, rail, trams and monorail, ports, shipping, and inland waterways, and air transport). Methods The intervention framework of this EGM reframes Berg et al's three categories (infrastructure, prices, and regulations) broadly as infrastructure, incentives, and institutions as subcategories for each intervention category which are each mode of transport (road, rail trams and monorail, ports, shipping, and inlands waterways, and air transport). This EGM identifies the area where intervention studies have been conducted as well as the current gaps in the evidence base. This EGM includes ongoing and completed impact evaluations and systematic reviews (SRs) of the effectiveness of transport sector interventions. This is a map of effectiveness studies (impact evaluations). The impact evaluations include experimental designs, nonexperimental designs, and regression designs. We have not included the before versus after studies and qualitative studies in this map. The search strategies included both academic and grey literature search on organisational websites, bibliographic searches and hand search of journals. An EGM is a table or matrix which provides a visual presentation of the evidence in a particular sector or a subsector. The map is presented as a matrix in which rows are intervention categories (e.g., roads) and subcategories (e.g., infrastructure) and the column outcome domains (e.g., environment) and subcategories as (e.g., air quality). Each cell contains studies of the corresponding intervention for the relevant outcome, with links to the available studies. Included studies were coded according to the intervention and outcomes assessed and additional filters as region, population, and study design. Critical appraisal of included SR was done using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR -2) rating scale. Selection Criteria The search included both academic and grey literature available online. We included impact evaluations and SRs that assessed the effectiveness of transport sector interventions in low- and middle-income countries.
   Results This EGM on the transport sector includes 466 studies from low- and middle-income countries, of which 34 are SRs and 432 impact evaluations. There are many studies of the effects of roads intervention in all three subcategories-infrastructure, incentives, and institutions, with the most studies in the infrastructure subcategories. There are no or fewer studies on the interventions category ports, shipping, and waterways and for civil aviation (Air Transport). In the outcomes, the evidence is most concentrated on transport infrastructure, services, and use, with the greatest concentration of evidence on transport time and cost (193 studies) and transport modality (160 studies). There is also a concentration of evidence on economic development and health and education outcomes. There are 139 studies on economic development, 90 studies on household income and poverty, and 101 studies on health outcomes. The major gaps in evidence are from all sectors except roads in the intervention. And there is a lack of evidence on outcome categories such as cultural heritage and cultural diversity and very little evidence on displacement (three studies), noise pollution (four studies), and transport equity (2). There is a moderate amount of evidence on infrastructure quantity (32 studies), location, land use and prices (49 studies), market access (29 studies), access to education facilities (23 studies), air quality (50 studies), and cost analysis including ex post CBA (21 studies). The evidence is mostly from East Asia and the Pacific Region (223 studies (40%), then the evidence is from the sub-Saharan Africa (108 studies), South Asia (96 studies), Latin America & Caribbean (79 studies). The least evidence is from Middle East & North Africa (30 studies) and Europe & Central Asia (20 studies). The most used study design is other regression design in all regions, with largest number from East Asia and Pacific (274). There is total 33 completed SRs identified and one ongoing, around 85% of the SR are rated low confidence, and 12% rated as medium confidence. Only one review was rated as high confidence. This EGM contains the available evidence in English. Conclusion This map shows the available evidence and gaps on the effectiveness of transport sector intervention in low- and middle-income countries. The evidence is highly concentrated on the outcome of transport infrastructure (especially roads), service, and use (351 studies). It is also concentrated in a specific region-East Asia and Pacific (223 studies)-and more urban populations (261 studies). Sectors with great development potential, such as waterways, are under-examined reflecting also under-investment. The available evidence can guide the policymakers, and government-related to transport sector intervention and its effects on many outcomes across sectors. There is a need to conduct experimental studies and quality SRs in this area. Environment, gender equity, culture, and education in low- and middle-income countries are under-researched areas in the transport sector.

AB  - The mining industry has been operating across the globe for millennia, but it is only in the last 50 years that remote sensing technology has enabled the visualization, mapping and assessment of mining impacts and landscape recovery. Our review of published literature (1970-2019) found that the number of ecologically focused remote sensing studies conducted on mine site rehabilitation increased gradually, with the greatest proportion of studies published in the 2010-2019 period. Early studies were driven exclusively by Landsat sensors at the regional and landscape scales while in the last decade, multiple earth observation and drone-based sensors across a diverse range of study locations contributed to our increased understanding of vegetation development post-mining. The Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) was the most common index, and was used in 45% of papers; while research that employed image classification techniques typically used supervised (48%) and manual interpretation methods (37%). Of the 37 publications that conducted error assessments, the average overall mapping accuracy was 84%. In the last decade, new classification methods such as Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) have emerged (10% of studies within the last ten years), along with new platforms and sensors such as drones (15% of studies within the last ten years) and high spatial and/or temporal resolution earth observation satellites. We used the monitoring standards recommended by the International Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) to determine the ecological attributes measured by each study. Most studies (63%) focused on land cover mapping (spatial mosaic); while comparatively fewer studies addressed complex topics such as ecosystem function and resilience, species composition, and absence of threats, which are commonly the focus of field-based rehabilitation monitoring. We propose a new research agenda based on identified knowledge gaps and the ecological monitoring tool recommended by SER, to ensure that future remote sensing approaches are conducted with a greater focus on ecological perspectives, i.e., in terms of final targets and end land-use goals. In particular, given the key rehabilitation requirement of self-sustainability, the demonstration of ecosystem resilience to disturbance and climate change should be a key area for future research.

AB  - Over the past three decades, Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), with transit as its central tenet, has emerged as a pivotal urban policy driving sustainable and intelligent urban growth, drawing significant attention from researchers and practitioners worldwide. TOD involves creating high-density, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly urban areas around transit stations to enhance transit accessibility, promote social cohesion, and improve housing conditions. However, the global implementation of TOD has encountered challenges across various domains including transportation, housing, and employment, thereby exacerbating inequities within the built environment. This study adopts a TOD perspective to comprehensively review the equity impacts of urban rail transit (URT) station areas on the built environment, with a particular focus on social, travel, perception, health, and spatial dimensions, and their impacts on promoting or hindering equitable outcomes among diverse societal groups. Utilizing a scoping review methodology, the study encapsulates the progress and themes in the field, employing a systematic approach to meticulously analyze the outcomes of each research theme. The findings reveal that URT station areas have positive impacts on economic growth and property values. However, they can also contribute to gentrification, exacerbating disparities between different societal groups in station and non-station areas, along with an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. Additionally, while these station areas encourage pedestrian activity and public transportation usage, they also carry the potential for environmental pollution, raising concerns about spatial accessibility and facility convenience, thereby impacting environmental equity. This study employs comprehensive and critical theoretical analyses, utilizing intricate methods and detailed indicators, to elucidate disparities in equity outcomes of URT station areas across different societal groups. The crucial challenge in future research lies in integrating the concept of equity into TOD planning strategies. This study aims to provide standardized and harmonized criteria for guiding equitable TOD planning policies, thereby enhancing the scientific basis and effectiveness of planning strategies. Ultimately, it seeks to offer theoretical insights towards the creation of a more equitable and inclusive urban built environment in the future.

AB  - This article intends to summarize the findings of studies on the relationship between farmers' behavioral intentions (BI) and water-conservation behavior (WCB) using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A systematic review of transcripts obtained from Internet-based searching on reliable scientific databases (e.g., SID, ProQuest, Springer, Science Direct, John Wiley, Sage, Taylor & Francis, Emerald Insight, and Google Scholar) was followed by outfitting data for the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Data from a total of 28 studies on WCB were synthesized and analyzed through the CMA procedure. The resulting evidence demonstrates that the total and summarized estimate point (i.e., correlation) for the associations of attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SNs), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) with BI was 0.46, 0.36, and 0.26, respectively (r((t)PBC) < r((t) SNs) < r((t)ATT) & RARR; BI). Furthermore, the effect size of the relationship between PBC and WCB was 0.27. The largest effect size pertained to the relationship between BI and WCB (BI & RARR; WCB) (r((t)BI) = 0.52). The take-home message of the article is that hypothetical statements of the TPB are confirmed, as would be hypothesized. These findings should still be regarded in the field of WCB research; thus, policymakers need to provide solutions and adapt their policy initiatives for water resource management based on these findings. For example, one of the solutions to improve water resource management based on the research results is to examine the views and realities constructed by farmers of water resources and related management styles before carrying out water resource management projects. Identifying the potential capabilities of farmers and their economic and social background to expand water-conservation behavior and the tendency and acceptance of water resource management project to be implemented is also an important requirement in making resource management projects effective. The use of various methods of the individual, group, and collective communication to interact with farmers combined with provision of extension training, as well as mobilizing and organizing farmers to facilitate effective management of water resources are recommended.

AB  - Industrial forestry typically leads to a simplified forest structure and altered species composition. Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25years ago to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and temperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no comprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well as un-harvested forests.
   Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78 studies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-harvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least in the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna.
   Retention cuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as higher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species taken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist species and unclassified species), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts.
   Retention cuts had negative impacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior species may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some open-habitat species compared with clearcuts.
   Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of forest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were not enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on biodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on either forest species or open-habitat species, although limited data may have hindered our capacity to identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic groups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively.
   Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for integrating biodiversity conservation and production forestry, although identifying optimal solutions between these two goals may need further attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will not substitute for conservation actions targeting certain highly specialized species associated with forest-interior or open-habitat conditions.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of literature on the residual effects of grain legumes in cereal -based systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to quantify the magnitude and variability of rotational effects, to explore the importance of environmental and management factors in determining variability and to evaluate the evidence of the different mechanisms that explain rotational effects. We retrieved 44 unique publications providing 199 observations comparing continuous cereal performance with that of a grain legume-cereal rotation. The overall mean yield increase of 0.49 t grain ha(-1), equal to an increase of 41% of the continuous cereal yield, is highly significant, but the variability in residual effects is large. Effects were more pronounced in southern Africa, the highlands of East Africa and the Guinea savannah, and less in the humid forest/derived savannah of West Africa and the Sudano-Sahelian zone. Maize showed stronger yield responses after a legume than millet and sorghum. Agro-ecological zone and cereal type were however confounded. All grain legume types significantly improved cereal yields, with stronger residual effects observed after soybean and groundnut than after cowpea. Fertiliser N application to cereals reduces the residual effects of legumes, but the response at 60-120 kg N ha(-1) still equalled 0.32 t ha(-1) or 59% of the response when no N is applied. The sustained benefits with large N applications indicate the importance of non-N effects. While mechanisms for improved soil P availability after grain legumes have been studied in some detail, it remains uncertain how important these are in farmers' fields. Grain legumes are unlikely to have a major influence on the availability of nutrients other than N and P, or on soil pH. Beneficial impacts of grain legumes on soil organic matter content can occur if legumes contribute to a greater overall cropping productivity, but studies generally report no such impacts. Evidence of impacts of grain legumes on weeds is limited to striga. Studies on the impacts on nematode pressure in cereals are inconclusive, probably because legumes act as a host for some of the key nematode genera that harm maize. The impact on the pressure of other pests and diseases in cereals is probably important, but evidence on this from SSA is lacking. Future research on N-2-fixation by grain legumes and residual N benefits should focus on explaining the wide variability observed among sites. There is a clear need for more detailed mechanistic studies to assess the occurrence and relevance of non-N effects of grain legumes, particularly in relation to common pests and diseases in cereals.

AB  - The dryland vegetation and particularly the Acacia- Commiphora woodlands support the livelihoods of approximately 52 million rural households in the Horn of Africa. Aromatic resins are valuable non- wood forest products (NWFPs) derived from Boswellia and Commiphora species in the drylands of this region. The study seeks to answer the following main questions: " What are the ecological and livelihood roles of resin producing species, and the role that people have in either degrading or restoring these ecosystems?" " Who are the participants in frankincense and myrrh production, processing, and trade, and how do these people interact?" " What is the current and potential future economic impact of frankincense and myrrh production and trade at the household level?" " What are the barriers to enhanced economic outcomes?" The study involves the use of PRISMA method- a systematic methodology to identify, select and analyze the recent literature on aromatic resins in relation to such factors as socio- economic situation, livelihood security, value chain, climate change adaptation, ecology and sustainable development in the Horn of Africa. Systematic identification of publications was conducted using several sources, including but not limited to electronic databases for literature search. Web of Science, Social Science Citation Index and Google Scholar and various scientific journals were investigated using search terms and restrictions. A total of 991 references were retrieved, but literature only published between 2003 to 2017 was selected, which led to the use of 51 works for full- text assessment. The results indicate that of the 51 selected studies, 45% focused on ecology and sustainable management, 31% on economic contribution and livelihood security, 20% on production and value chain development, and 4% on climate change adaptation and mitigation. It could be concluded that farmers' adoption of Boswellia and Commiphora species as economic tree crops in the Horn of Africa has a distinct role in biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation by contributing to the sustainability of ecosystem functioning as well as improving household incomes and the rural livelihood security in general, and thereby facilitating poverty alleviation.

AB  - Introduction Compared with heterosexual, cisgender populations, sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are more likely to suffer from serious health conditions and insufficient access to health services. Primary care is at the frontlines of healthcare delivery; yet, few clinics have resources or mechanisms in place to meet SGM patient needs. This developmental study protocol focuses on reducing health disparities among SGM patients by identifying, adapting and developing SGM practice guidelines/recommendations and implementation strategies for primary care clinics in urban and rural New Mexico. Using input from patients, healthcare advocates and providers, and researchers, the study will pilot a practice parameter and implementation toolkit to promote SGM-specific cultural competence at multiple service delivery levels.
   Methods and analysis We will recruit providers/staff from four Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) serving ethnically and geographically diverse communities. Incorporating the Implementation of Change Model and an intersectionality perspective, data collection includes a systematic review of SGM-specific practice guidelines/recommendations, focus groups and semistructured interviews, quantitative surveys and the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) with providers/staff. We will categorise guidelines/recommendations identified through the review by shared elements, use iterative processes of open and focused coding to analyse qualitative data from focus groups, interviews and the NGT, and apply descriptive statistics to assess survey data. Findings will provide the foundation for the toolkit. Focus groups with SGM patients will yield supplemental information for toolkit refinement. To investigate changes in primary care contexts following the toolkit's pilot, we will undertake systematic walkthroughs and document review at the FQHCs, analysing these data qualitatively to examine SGM inclusiveness. The structured data-informed Plan-Do-Study-Act method will enable further revision of the toolkit. Finally, focus groups, interviews and quantitative surveys with providers/staff will highlight changes made in the FQHCs to address SGM patient needs, barriers to sustainment of changes, satisfaction, acceptability, usability and feasibility of the toolkit.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation Institutional Review Board. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants before their involvement in research activities begins. Study results will be actively disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, social media and the internet, and community/stakeholder engagement activities.

AB  - Applying scientific knowledge to confront societal challenges is a difficult task, an issue known as the science-practice gap. In Ecology and Conservation, scientific evidence has been seldom used directly to support decision-making, despite calls for an increasing role of ecological science in developing solutions for a sustainable future. To date, multiple causes of the science-practice gap and diverse approaches to link science and practice in Ecology and Conservation have been proposed. To foster a transparent debate and broaden our understanding of the difficulties of using scientific knowledge, we reviewed the perceived causes of the science-practice gap, aiming to: (i) identify the perspectives of ecologists and conservation scientists on this problem, (ii) evaluate the predominance of these perspectives over time and across journals, and (iii) assess them in light of disciplines studying the role of science in decision-making. We based our review on 1563 sentences describing causes of the science-practice gap extracted from 122 articles and on discussions with eight scientists on how to classify these sentences. The resulting process-based framework describes three distinct perspectives on the relevant processes, knowledge and actors in the science-practice interface. The most common perspective assumes only scientific knowledge should support practice, perceiving a one-way knowledge flow from science to practice and recognizing flaws in knowledge generation, communication, and/or use. The second assumes that both scientists and decision-makers should contribute to support practice, perceiving a two-way knowledge flow between science and practice through joint knowledge-production/integration processes, which, for several reasons, are perceived to occur infrequently. The last perspective was very rare, and assumes scientists should put their results into practice, but they rarely do. Some causes (e.g. cultural differences between scientists and decision-makers) are shared with other disciplines, while others seem specific to Ecology and Conservation (e.g. inadequate research scales). All identified causes require one of three general types of solutions, depending on whether the causal factor can (e.g. inadequate research questions) or cannot (e.g. scientific uncertainty) be changed, or if misconceptions (e.g. undervaluing abstract knowledge) should be solved. The unchanged predominance of the one-way perspective over time may be associated with the prestige of evidence-based conservation and suggests that debates in Ecology and Conservation lag behind trends in other disciplines towards bidirectional views ascribing larger roles to decision-makers. In turn, the two-way perspective seems primarily restricted to research traditions historically isolated from mainstream conservation biology. All perspectives represented superficial views of decision-making by not accounting for limits to human rationality, complexity of decision-making contexts, fuzzy science-practice boundaries, ambiguity brought about by science, and different types of knowledge use. However, joint knowledge-production processes from the two-way perspective can potentially allow for democratic decision-making processes, explicit discussions of values and multiple types of science use.
   To broaden our understanding of the interface and foster productive science-practice linkages, we argue for dialogue among different research traditions within Ecology and Conservation, joint knowledge-production processes between scientists and decision-makers and interdisciplinarity across Ecology, Conservation and Political Science in both research and education.

AB  - Globally, insect pests are the primary reason for reduced crop yield and quality. Although pesticides are commonly used to control and eliminate these pests, they can have adverse effects on the environment, human health, and natural resources. As an alternative, integrated pest management has been devised to enhance insect pest control, decrease the excessive use of pesticides, and enhance the output and quality of crops. With the improvements in artificial intelligence technologies, several applications have emerged in the agricultural context, including automatic detection, monitoring, and identification of insects. The purpose of this article is to outline the leading techniques for the automated detection of insects, highlighting the most successful approaches and methodologies while also drawing attention to the remaining challenges and gaps in this area. The aim is to furnish the reader with an overview of the major developments in this field. This study analysed 92 studies published between 2016 and 2022 on the automatic detection of insects in traps using deep learning techniques. The search was conducted on six electronic databases, and 36 articles met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were studies that applied deep learning techniques for insect classification, counting, and detection, written in English. The selection process involved analysing the title, keywords, and abstract of each study, resulting in the exclusion of 33 articles. The remaining 36 articles included 12 for the classification task and 24 for the detection task. Two main approaches-standard and adaptable-for insect detection were identified, with various architectures and detectors. The accuracy of the classification was found to be most influenced by dataset size, while detection was significantly affected by the number of classes and dataset size. The study also highlights two challenges and recommendations, namely, dataset characteristics (such as unbalanced classes and incomplete annotation) and methodologies (such as the limitations of algorithms for small objects and the lack of information about small insects). To overcome these challenges, further research is recommended to improve insect pest management practices. This research should focus on addressing the limitations and challenges identified in this article to ensure more effective insect pest management.

AB  - Simple Summary Dog parks contribute physical and social benefits for both canines and their owners, especially during and since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, dogs in public places can create various conflicts. Growing numbers of scholars have explored strategies for effective park design and management. This systematic study synthesizes and analyze the benefits, conflicts, and strategies for the design and management of dog parks according to the PRISMA guidelines. Based on the summary of conflicts between canines, humans, and their environment, we present design and management guidance for dog parks to effectively mitigate these conflicts while enhancing the benefits of off-leash areas. While this study promotes a sustainable and healthy coexistence of canines and residents of built environments through appropriate design and management strategies, several research and practice gaps have been identified from the results, such as the dearth of experimental evidence and limitations of the physical benefits of dog parks. These research gaps provide opportunities for experts to address in future. Dog ownership and dog walking brings various health benefits for urban dwellers, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, but trigger a number of controversies. Dog parks have become increasingly significant public resources in the pandemic to support these benefits while facing intense conflicts. To develop effective dog parks in urban settings, growing numbers of scholars have provided insights into the design and management strategies for addressing the benefits and conflicts. The objective of this study is to synthesize and analyze various aspects of dog park design and management and to assess identified strategies for enhancing their benefits while mitigating their drawbacks. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic study was conducted to synthesize the benefits, conflicts, and management strategies of dog parks, supported by Citespace. Benefits and conflicts in dog park design and management have been synthesized and organized according to their frequency of presence and the statistical results. We analyzed and assessed existing design and management strategies. Through this systematic study, we discovered the need obtain o po experimental evidence on effective dog park design and management to enhance their benefits while mitigating their sources of conflict and limitations in the intensity of park visitors' physical activity in off-leash areas.

AB  - Background: Over the past few years, researchers have investigated whether varying menstrual statuses and oestrogen levels could affect the likelihood of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), with conflicting results. While some studies suggest a potential link between increased oestrogen levels and higher TMD risk, others have found no correlation. It is worth noting that oestrogen levels can impact the structure and function of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). In the light of these findings, our study seeks to investigate the prevalence of TMDs among pregnant women.
   Methods: We searched in PubMed, Web of Science and Lilacs for articles published from the inception until 20 January 2023. We applied the Population, Exposure, Comparator and Outcomes (PECO) model to assess the document eligibility: (P) Participants: female human subjects. (E) Exposure: pregnancy. (C) Comparison: pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women in the childbearing age. (O) Outcome: TMDs diagnosis. Only study providing data about the prevalence in both group (pregnant and non-pregnant) were included. We set the following exclusion criteria: (1) diagnosis of rheumatic diseases or chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile, idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis); (2) diagnosis of fibromyalgia; (3) congenital abnormality or neoplastic conditions in the TMJ region; (4) studies including subjects undergoing arthrocentesis or intra-articular infiltrations; (5) studies including local pressure pain assessment; (6) studies including women in menopause in the control group (7) cross-over study design; (8) language different from English; (9) full- text unavailability (i.e. posters and conference abstracts); (10) studies involving animals; (11) review (topical or systematic) article; (12) case reports/series; (13) studies evaluating TMDs prevalence in subjects not pregnant. The software Review Manager version 5.2.8 (Cochrane Collaboration) was used to perform the pooled analysis. We measured the risk ratio (RR) between the two groups (pregnant and non-pregnant).
   Results: The included subjects in this review were 440. Among them, 244 were pregnant while the remaining 196 were age matched non-pregnant women. Among those pregnant 102 presented sign/symptoms of TMD or TMD diagnosis (41.8%) whereas 80 of those not pregnant were diagnosed with (40.8%). The overall effect showed that there was no difference in TMD prevalence between pregnant and non-pregnant women in childbearing age (RR 1.12; 95% CI: 0.65-1.93), suggesting that pregnant is neither a risk factor nor a protective factor for TMD.
   Conclusions: Overall, we did not find an association between TMD and pregnancy, neither positive nor negative. Further studies on larger samples are needed to clarify our results.

AB  - Context The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set targets related to important global poverty, health, and sustainability issues. A critical but underinvestigated question for planning and allocating resources toward the MDGs is how interventions related to one MDG might affect progress toward other goals.
   Objectives To estimate the reduction in child mortality as a result of interventions related to the environmental and nutritional MDGs (improving child nutrition and providing clean water, sanitation, and fuels) and to estimate how the magnitude and distribution of the effects of interventions vary based on the economic status of intervention recipients.
   Design, Setting, and Population Population-level comparative risk assessment modeling the mortality effects of interventions on child nutrition and environmental risk factors, stratified by economic status. Data on economic status, child underweight, water and sanitation, and household fuels were from the nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys for 42 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Data on disease-specific child mortality were from the World Health Organization. Data on the hazardous effects of each MDG-related risk factor were from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies.
   Main Outcome Measure Child mortality, stratified by comparable international quintiles of economic status.
   Results Implementing interventions that improve child nutrition and provide clean water and sanitation and clean household fuels to all children younger than 5 years would result in an estimated annual reduction in child deaths of 49 700 (14%) in Latin America and the Caribbean, 0.80 million (24%) in South Asia, and 1.47 million (31%) in sub-Saharan Africa. These benefits are equivalent to 30% to 48% of the current regional gaps toward the MDG target on reducing child mortality. Fifty percent coverage of the same environmental and nutritional interventions, as envisioned by the MDGs, would reduce child mortality by 26 900, 0.51 million, and 1.02 million in the 3 regions, respectively, if the interventions are implemented among the poor first. These reductions are 30% to 75% larger than those expected if the same 50% coverage first reached the wealthier households, who nonetheless are in need of similar interventions.
   Conclusions Interventions related to nutritional and environmental MDGs can also provide substantial gains toward the MDG of reducing child mortality. To maximize the reduction in childhood mortality, such integrated management of interventions should prioritize the poor.

AB  - purpose: Value co-creation (VCC) recently displayed a significant increase in the frequency of publications in business studies and social sciences. Our study objects to explore the current state of VCC research in the business-to-business (B2B) context, principally in the marketing field.
   Research design, approach, and methodology: This research article extracted research papers on VCC in the B2B context published in the last two decades through the Web of Science (WoS). Initially, we applied HistCite to determine the research dynamics of VCC articles and then VOS viewer to conduct bibliographic coupling and cartographic analysis. Furthermore, we found the most co-occurred keywords in the abstracts, titles, and keywords.
   Findings: Our research explored that the United Kingdom was the most important country with 27 publications and 594 citations. Aarikka-Stenroos L was the most influential author, among his research is a systematic review which revealed that scholars of B2B journals adopted the term business "ecosystem" and studied the implications of ecosystem perspective in business and innovation networks and received the most citations. Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) was the most influential journal because it published 8 of the 10 most cited articles. One hundred and six out of 121 publications were in Business research and seventy-six were in management area, which made it the most hot and critical research area. Lappeenranta University was the most essential organization in VCC research based on the most records published and second-highest citations.
   Research limitations/implications and future research: Four research streams have emerged which indicate the prominent role of VCC in the B2B context (1) VCC and relationships, (2) VCC and organizational capabilities, (3) VCC and actors' engagement at various platforms, and (4) VCC and processes. Our research paper provided a base for conceptualizing publications related to business, management, operations research management science, and social sciences interdisciplinary on VCC in the B2B context. Content analysis has revealed that research work on VCC in the B2B context is at an early stage in the marketing arena. Along with bringing some sort of consensus regarding researchers' opinion toward the nature and modality of VCC literature and process in the B2B context, we urge future research to focus on how relationships and their precursors can be efficiently utilized to co-create and enhance value within B2B interactions. We also request future research to focus on making the VCC process sustainable and viable both on a time and economical basis.
   Practical implications: Organizations can involve customers and producers to work jointly to co-create value for their goods and services with negligible cost to achieve higher market shares and a competitive edge over rivals. Originality/valueThis might be the first bibliometric study conducted on VCC in the B2B context (there are some Bibliometric VCC publications, but they are not B2B-specific, our research is the first Bibliometric study conducted on VCC in the B2B context) in the marketing field and can expose novel avenues for future research.

AB  - Graphene serves as the most disruptive material in the twenty-first century and plays an unsubstitutable role in solving the sustainable development problems of energy crises, water shortages, and environmental pollution. Recently, obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) in the field of graphene has gained increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, few attempts have been made to summarize the SCA of this field by applying patent information. Basing on a patent-based multi-level perspective (MLP), this study aims to develop an approach to identify SCA in the target technological area by conducting a patent review from the comprehensive perspectives of the macro landscape, meso socio-technical system, and micro niches, and then integrate patent analysis with technology life cycle (TLC) theory to examine patents involving global technological competition. The effectiveness of the approach is verified with a case study on graphene. The results show that the graphene field is an emerging and fast-growing technological field, with an increasing number of patents over the year. The TLC of graphene technology demonstrated an approximate S shape, with China, the U.S., Korea, and Japan filing the largest number of graphene patents. Evidenced by Derwent Manual Codes, we found an increase in consideration given to technological application and material preparation topics over time, and research hotspots and fronts that have SCA. In terms of a leading country or region with SCA, the U.S., with a high foreign patent filing rate, large number of high forward citation patents, strong assignees' competitive position, and large number of high-strength patents, was still the most powerful leader, with a higher SCA in the graphene industry. Korea also obtained a relatively higher SCA and will be a promising competitor in this field. Although China was shown to be catching-up very rapidly in the total number of graphene patents, the apparent innovation gaps in the foreign patent filing rate, high value patents, and Industry-University-Research Collaboration will obviously hamper Chinese catch-up efforts for obtaining SCA. As for patentees, the most powerful leaders with a higher SCA represented by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, International Business Machines Corp, and Nanotek Instruments Inc were identified. In addition, most of the high strength patents were owned by the above patentees. Further, valuable contributions to the understanding of SCA in graphene technology were summarized. First, the proposed patent-based MLP provides a new and comprehensive analytical framework for review research, as well as SCA analysis, and extends its research perspectives. Second, it introduces patent indicators to the previous MLP model, and provides a new theoretical perspective for the study of technological innovation in the previous MLP model. Third, this paper employs the TLC theory to explore the dynamic SCA in the given technology field, which further develops the concept of the MLP model from the temporal dimension. Finally, future research directions were demonstrated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of this field using patent analysis, comprehensively acknowledging the current technological competition and development in the graphene field and that of the future, and can be applied to various other emerging technology fields.

AB  - Estimates of forest biomass are needed for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. As local measurements are costly, there is a great interest in obtaining reliable estimates over large areas from remote sensing data. Currently, such estimates are obtained with a variety of data sources, statistical methods and prediction standards, and there is no agreement on what are best practices for this task.
   To improve our understanding of how these different methods affect prediction quality, we first conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the most common sensor types and prediction methods. Based on the review, we identified sample size of the reference points on the ground, prediction method (step-wise linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, Gaussian processes and k-nearest neighbor), and sensor type as the main differences that could potentially affect predictive quality. We then compared those factors in two case study areas in Germany and Chile, for which airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne discrete return LiDAR and spaceborne hyperspectral data were available. For each factor combination, we calculated Pearson's coefficient of correlation between observations and predictions (r(2)) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for bootstrapped estimates using k-fold cross-validation with a varying number of folds. Finally, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the influence of the factors on the predictive error of the biomass models.
   Our results confirm previous findings that predictor data (sensor) type is the most important factor for the accuracy of biomass estimates, with LiDAR being preferable to hyperspectral data. In contrast to some previous studies, complementing LiDAR with hyperspectral data did not improve predictive accuracy. Also the prediction method had a substantial effect on accuracy and was generally more important than the sample size. In most cases, random forest performed best and stepwise linear models worst, judging from r(2) and RMSE under cross-validation. Additional results suggested that r(2) may deliver unrealistically large values when the hold-out sample during the cross-validation is too small.
   In conclusion, our literature review revealed that different methods for biomass estimation are currently used, with no general agreement on best practices. In our case studies, we found substantial accuracy differences between those methods, with LiDAR data, in combination with a random forest algorithm and a large number of reference sample units on the ground yielding the lowest error for biomass predictions. The comparatively high importance of the statistical prediction method seems particularly relevant, as they suggest that choosing the appropriate statistical method may be more effective than obtaining additional field data for obtaining good biomass estimates. Considering the costs of improving accuracy of global and regional biomass estimates by ground measurements, it seems sensible to invest in further comparative studies, preferably with a wider range of sites and including also RADAR sensors, to establish robust best-practice recommendations for obtaining regional and global biomass estimates from remote-sensing data.

AB  - Background: Electronic health (eHealth) is a rapidly evolving field informed by multiple scientific disciplines. Because of this, the use of different terms and concepts to explain the same phenomena and lack of standardization in reporting interventions often leaves a gap that hinders knowledge accumulation. Interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies are a cross-disciplinary area potentially affected by this gap. A review of the underlying frameworks, models, and theories that have informed projects at this crossroad could advance future research and development efforts.
   Objective: This research aimed to identify and compare underlying approaches that have informed interventions focused on self-management support of cardiovascular diseases through the use of remote monitoring technologies. The objective was to achieve an understanding of the distinct approaches by highlighting common or conflicting principles, guidelines, and methods.
   Methods: The metaethnography approach was used to review and synthesize researchers' reports on how they applied frameworks, models, and theories in their projects. Literature was systematically searched in 7 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Included studies were thoroughly read and coded to extract data for the synthesis. Studies were mainly related by the key ingredients of the underlying approaches they applied. The key ingredients were finally translated across studies and synthesized into thematic clusters.
   Results: Of 1224 initial results, 17 articles were included. The articles described research and development of 10 different projects. Frameworks, models, and theories (n=43) applied by the projects were identified. Key ingredients (n=293) of the included articles were mapped to the following themes of eHealth development: (1) it is a participatory process; (2) it creates new infrastructures for improving health care, health, and well-being; (3) it is intertwined with implementation; (4) it integrates theory, evidence, and participatory approaches for persuasive design; (5) it requires continuous evaluation cycles; (6) it targets behavior change; (7) it targets technology adoption; and (8) it targets health-related outcomes.
   Conclusions: The findings of this review support and exemplify the numerous possibilities in the use of frameworks, models, and theories to guide research and development of eHealth. Participatory, user-centered design, and integration with empirical evidence and theoretical modeling were widely identified principles in the literature. On the contrary, less attention has been given to the integration of implementation in the development process and supporting novel eHealth-based health care infrastructures. To better integrate theory and evidence, holistic approaches can combine patient-centered studies with consolidated knowledge from expert-based approaches.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can differences in DNA isolation alter assessment of sperm telomere length (spTL) and do they account for conflicting results in the literature on spTL and male fertility?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: DNA isolation methods preferentially include or exclude short, extrachromosomal (EC) telomere-specific sequences that alter spTL measurements, and are responsible for a proportion of the disparity observed between investigations.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The relationship between spTL and male fertility has become an active area of research. The results across investigations, however, have been discordant, generating a need to critically evaluate the existing body of knowledge to guide future investigations.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Quantitative experiments determined the effect of DNA isolation on the integrity of sperm DNA and measures of spTL, while a systematic analysis of the current literature evaluated the effect of DNA isolation and study design on experimental outcomes.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two DNA isolation methods were compared: Genomic Tips which isolate 'High Molecular Weight' (HMW) DNA exclusively, and QIAamp (R) DNA Mini which isolates 'Total' genomic DNA irrespective of size. DNA quality was assessed via field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) and spTL was measured via terminal restriction fragment analysis. In addition, major databases in medicine, health and the life sciences were subject to a targeted search, and results were independently screened according to defined exclusion/inclusion criterion. Findings from primary articles were analyzed for concordance and study designs were compared across six moderator variables (sample size, participant age, fertility status, semen fraction, telomere population and type of analysis).
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: HMW DNA spTL was significantly longer than spTL measured from total DNA (P < 0.01), indicating that Total DNA contained short, EC telomeric repeats that shifted downstream assessment towards shorter spTL. HMW DNA spTL reflected the length of intact, chromosomal telomeres. Major findings on spTL showed the greatest concordance amongst studies that implemented HMW DNA isolation prior to spTL assessment. Studies that utilized Total DNA varied in concordance, but outcomes were similar if (i) a comparative analysis was applied or (ii) a sample size threshold of 81 was achieved for correlative analysis.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Chromosomal and EC telomeric DNA were distinguished based on outcomes of HMW DNA isolation and size. Further experiments are required to determine the nature and function of these two types of telomeric sequences.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study reveals a dramatic impact of upstream DNA processing and study design on measurements of spTL, which accounts for conflicting results in the literature. Future assessments of spTL should incorporate independent detection of chromosomal and EC telomeric DNA and specific experimental planning.

AB  - This review investigates the potential of using roof harvested rainwater to support urban agriculture. Among the important issues, we concentrate on system configuration, modelling and economic analysis while comparing research from both developed and developing countries. Urban agriculture contributes notably to food and nutrition in many developing nations, and is receiving increasing attention in developed countries due to a cultural shift towards sustainable living coupled with increasing demand and food prices. Domestic rainwater harvesting (RWH) from rooftops increasingly forms part of integrated water management strategies and has seen a considerable amount of research on modelling and economics, as has water use in agriculture. However domestic RWH usually focuses on in-house usage such as toilet flushing and washing, while there has been very little research specific to its use in food production. In developing countries home gardens often fail due to insufficient rainfall and water supply. In general, promoting urban agriculture and the greening of cities begs the question of whether there is sufficient water available to support it and where additional water will come from.
   A scoping review following a five step criteria is adopted here to understand the extent to which roof harvested rainwater can be used to support urban agriculture and what are the associated economic implications. In view of the broad scope of the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus, under which this research fits, this scoping review is deemed better suited (in absence of an ample body of literature) to the synthesis of relevant researches than a systematic review. The major contributions of this review are to highlight the lack of initiatives to utilise harvested rainwater in urban agriculture, to explore the obstacles and to lay a foundation for new areas of research within the sustainable urban development paradigm. Furthermore, the comparison between developed and developing countries helps bring to light cultural, socio-economic and political obstacles to improving sustainability and healthier living in the urban environment. The impact of history and traditions on crop choice, growing methods and consequently water consumption rates are also discussed.
   This review is particularly relevant to three of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (i.e. Cleaner and Sustainable Cities; Health and Wellbeing and No Hunger). It is found that there is a considerable potential to supply water to urban agriculture using customised roof RWH system designs. For example, one study reports that up to 41% of urban horticulture sites in Rome could be sustained by water harvested from local roofs. Irrigating a small garden (20 m(2)) with harvested rainwater can increase the yield by about 20% meeting the caloric requirements of a typical Indian household. Further research is needed on the integration of roof rainwater harvesting and urban agriculture to maximise its contribution to food production and sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Turkey hosts the world's largest community of Syrians displaced by the conflict. The Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) is a coordinated set of priority reproductive health services. There is not any scoping review assessing the RH situation of Syrian refugees in Turkey within the framework of the MISP objectives. The objectives of this review is to identify the situation of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) among Syrian refugee women in Turkey, and document the health services provided for them in terms of the components of MISP. We hoped to show evidence of gaps and help guide future research to focus on priority areas to improve the range, quality, and access to SRH services and to recommend public health interventions. Method The literature search was conducted in Turkish and English. Multiple electronic databases (Turkish Medline, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBSCOHost, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched from January 2011 to May 2018. References published in the peer-reviewed literature, the grey-literature, and on websites were eligible for inclusion if they had conducted research on one or more of the following SRH topics specifically for Syrian women in Turkey: maternal and neonatal health/antenatal care, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, use of contraceptives, sexual violence, and services delivery and accessibility. References were excluded if any of the following criteria were relevant: not specific to Syrian women refugees in Turkey. Firstly, the titles and abstracts of the articles that were found were examined to determine if they met the eligibility criteria. Secondly, if the abstracts and titles met one or more of the eligibility criteria, the full text of the articles have been examined. Finally, standard forms were prepared and used to summarize the articles narratively. The results of the screening were recorded in Excel spreadsheets for comparison, and any disagreements among the researchers were resolved by consensus. The studies were grouped according to the MISP objectives. Results A total of 24 publications were eligible for inclusion in the review. Consanguineous marriage rate was 56%. The rate of marriage under age 18 were very high. Mean age at first marriage was found to be between 18 and 20. The rate of antenatal care was inadequate. The rate of using a modern contraceptive method was 24% among married and all age groups of Syrian women. The rates of unmet family planning needs were about 35%. Among patients admitted to gynecology outpatient clinics, about half of the applicants were reported to have abnormal vaginal discharge. The reported rates of sexual violence were about 8%. Only 20% of Syrian women had regular gynecological visits. Conclusion Overall, we conclude that early marriage, low modern contraceptive use, unmet need for contraception, sexual and gender-based violence are the major SRH issues reported. There is a need for further studies to identify the barriers limiting service uptake as well as to document successful practices. Long term strategies to improve the SRH status of Syrian refugee women should be developed with participation of all stakeholders. This review is significant in terms of that it is the first scoping review assessing the RH situation of Syrian refugees in Turkey within the framework of the MISP objectives. Based on the data of this review, relevant policy makers should consider to improve the SRH status of Syrian women refugees in Turkey.

AB  - Purpose Even though the implementation of lean in health care environments is relatively recent, it has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. Partly because of the fact that it is a recent field of practise and research and partly because the number of works developed in this field has grown rapidly, it is important to frequently update the perspectives on this field of investigation. Thus, this study aims to review the implementation of lean tools and techniques applied to hospital organizational areas in a five-year period, between 2014 and 2018, complementing some of the most relevant reviews already published. The most important criteria such as tools, methods and principles, hospital areas intervened, improvements and difficulties were assessed and quantified. Design/methodology/approach As starting point for this systematic literature review (SLR), a set of selected pre-existing review publications was used to support the current study and as the ground base for the expansion of the studies about lean health care. The current study contemplated 114 articles from a five-year period between 2014 and 2018. A subset of 58 of these articles was critically assessed to understand the application of lean tools and methods in different hospital areas. Findings The thorough analysis of selected articles show a lack of works in continuous improvement approaches when compared to the application of production organization methods, visual management and diagnosing and problem-solving tools. The reported improvement results demonstrate alignment with the principles and foundations of lean philosophy, but such results are presented in isolated initiatives and without robust evidence of long-term maintenance. Moreover, this study shows an evolution in the number of articles referring to lean implementation in hospital areas, but in its great majority, such articles report isolated implementations in different areas, not spreading those for the global organization. Thus, some of the main recommendations are the need to implement studies on complete flows of patients, drugs and materials, instead of isolated initiatives and strive to promote the cultural change of hospitals through structural changes, following new visions and strategic objectives, supported by real models of continuous structural and sustained improvement. Originality/value The current study develops a new perspective of the articles published under the thematic of lean health care, published in a recent period of five years, which are not completely covered by other works. Additionally, it explicitly applied, in an innovative way, an approach that used a set of previous reviews as the starting point for this SLR. In this way, it integrates approaches and categories from different SLRs, creating a framework of analysis that can be used by future researchers. Finally, it shows the most recent implementations of lean health care, exposing the current trends, improvements and also the main gaps.

AB  - BackgroundBiliary tract cancers are rare aggressive malignancies typically diagnosed when the disease is metastatic or unresectable, precluding curative treatment.ObjectiveWe aimed to identify treatment guidelines, real-world treatment patterns, and outcomes for unresectable advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers in adult patients.MethodsDatabases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were systematically searched between 1 January, 2000 and 25 November, 2021, and supplemented by hand searches. Eligible records were (1) treatment guidelines and (2) observational studies reporting real-world treatment outcomes, for unresectable advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers. Only studies performed in the UK, Germany, France, Australia, Canada and South Korea were extracted, to moderate the number of records for synthesis while maintaining representation of a wide range of biliary tract cancer incidences.ResultsA total of 66 relevant unique full-text records were extracted, including 16 treatment guidelines and 50 observational studies. Among guidelines, chemotherapies were most strongly recommended at first line (1L); the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GEMCIS) was recommended as the standard of care in 1L. Recommendations for systemic chemotherapy in the second line (2L) conflicted because of uncertainties around survival benefit. Guidelines on further lines of treatment included a range of locoregional modalities and stenting or best supportive care without providing clear recommendations because of data paucity. Fifty observational studies reporting real-world treatment outcomes were extracted, of which 25 (50%) and 9 (18%) reported outcomes in 1L and 2L, respectively; 22 (44%) reported outcomes for treatments described as 'palliative'. In 1L, outcomes for systemic chemotherapy were most frequently described (23/25 studies), and GEMCIS was the most common systemic chemotherapy used (10/23 studies) in line with guidelines. Median overall survival with 1L systemic chemotherapy was < 12 months in most studies (16/23; range 4.7-22.3 months). Most 2L studies (10/11) described outcomes for systemic chemotherapy, most commonly for fluoropyrimidine-based regimen (5/10 studies). Median overall survival with 2L systemic chemotherapy was < 12 months in 5/10 studies (range 4.9-21.5 months). Median progression-free survival was reported more rarely than median overall survival. Some studies with small sample sizes or specifically selected patient populations (e.g. higher performance status, or patients who had already responded to treatment) achieved higher median overall survival.ConclusionsAt the time of this review, treatment options for unresectable advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers confer poor real-world survival. For over a decade, GEMCIS remained the 1L standard of care, highlighting the lack of therapeutic innovation in this indication and the urgent unmet need for novel treatments with improved outcomes in this aggressive condition. Additional observational studies are needed to further understand the effectiveness of currently available treatments, as well as newly available therapies including the addition of immunotherapy in the evolving treatment landscape.

AB  - Supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) are alternative to the conventional cement and have been studied by so many authors owing to the high carbon content of cement. The use of SCM is significant in addressing challenges of carbon emission and its impact on the 2050 carbon reduction RoadMap. Available studies shows that SCM obtained from both industrial and agricultural wastes presents significant variability in performance as cement dosage in concrete increases. The first aim of this study is to map and synthesize the available evidence from literatures to support this variability. The second objective is to provide statistical evidence from available literatures of certain SCM that enhance the structural performance of low carbon concrete in terms of compressive strength. From the results, trend of findings from literatures on the use of SCM shows a surge in research for cement replacement occurring over the last decade with optimal performance for industrial waste SCM shown to be limiting at 40% cement replacement while that from agricultural waste occurs at 10% cement replacement. Data were sourced from Scopus database and selected from peer review journals of both primary and secondary studies on cement replacement materials. 728 published articles were obtained from the search using four strings namely,'Recent cement* replacement and cementitious materials'', ''Recent supplementary cementitious materials', ''Eco-friendly and cementitious materials'' and ''Low carbon intensive cement replacement materials'. Meta-analysis is carried out on the selected articles having quantitative data to synthesise some of the result of the published articles to examine the impact of Ground granular base slag and Pulverized Fuel Ash cement on concrete strength development as cement replacement. It is shown that Ground granular base slag, Pulverized Fuel Ash and Metakaolin improve and enhance the eco friendliness of the concrete. From the results, optimal percentage of cement replacement is a gap which remains unresolved due to mineralogy and reactivity of the SCMs and would provide the solution for the desired green concrete optimization. It is shown with statistical evidence from meta-analysis that ground granular base slag and Pulverised fuel ash decreases the effect of low compressive strength by at least 2% to about 75% which is considered in our opinion as effective to enhance the sustainability of concrete.

AB  - 1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones.
   2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones.
   3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition.
   4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial.
   5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.

AB  - Purpose Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature on multigenerational teams, to evaluate the maturity of the research area, identify key themes, and highlight areas for future research. Generational differences in the workforce are becoming a critical factor, as four generations (Veterans/Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y/Millennials) currently co-exist, and a fifth generation (Generation Z) stands poised to enter the workforce. To manage these differences effectively, organizations must first understand the various generations and, ultimately, their interaction and engagement with each other. Whereas some literature on the differences between the generations and how they pertain to the organizational work environment exists, currently, it is unclear what is known about how these differences impact the performance of multigenerational teams. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a systematic literature review on teams and generational differences. A total of 7 platforms were included, resulting in 121 articles in the final paper set. Findings The review confirmed a low presence of literature related to generational differences and teams, implying the knowledge area is currently immature; however, despite this, there is an upward trajectory in publications and citations over the past few years, and existing publications and citations span a number of countries, suggesting a likelihood of significant growth in the research area in the near future. Further, key themes were identified in the current literature relating to commitment, leadership, team dynamics, conflict and wages and work environment. Research limitations/implications - Only seven platforms were included in this review, although the seven platforms chosen are believed to provide comprehensive coverage of the field. The search strings used were "generation" and "team," which was the word combination found to produce the largest number of results in preliminary trials; however, it is possible that using additional word combinations might have yielded some additional papers. Finally, the review was limited to English-language articles (or their translations); although, ultimately, only two articles were eliminated because of lack of an English language version. Practical implications The findings can be used by organizations to identify factors of interest in managing multigenerational teams, as well as what is currently known about influencing those factors to achieve more positive team outcomes. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this appears to be the first systematic literature review on generational differences in teams. Given the importance of this topic, this review is critical to provide a baseline on what is currently known in the field and existing research and practice gaps.

AB  - Non-food biomass production has developed significantly in the latest decades to meet the needs of the bio-economy, and should expand in the future. Concerns around the consequences on land-use prompted a surge in scientific publications over the past 10 years. Attributing LUC to biomass production and ultimately the rising demand for its end-products (eg, biofuels) requires the elicitation of mechanisms relating feedstock production to land use or management changes, and their impacts on the environment. They may be analysed as a three-step causal chain starting with the identification of factors driving feedstock production, the assessment of LUC occurring in response to this demand, and the associated environmental impacts. A key question is whether or not the inclusion of LUC effects in this balance may negate their potential benefits over fossile-based products. Here we surveyed the scientific literature on LUC in general between 1975 and 2014, and retrieved a body of about 240 references which were analysed in details in terms of scope, LUC types, methodologies employed, and overall outcomes. Liquid biofuels accounted for 75% of the bio-based end-products analysed, the remaining 25% being dominated by combustion applications and a marginal contribution of biomaterials and chemicals. The predominant types of LUC included the conversion of annual crops or grassland to perennial crops and grassland to annual crops, followed by the conversion of forests. Although it was difficult to separate between direct and indirect LUC, it was surprising to note that the majority of these changes (60%) occurred in Europe and North America, whereas South America only accounted for 19% of those. In terms of methodologies economic and biophysical models dominated for LUC assessment, and so did life-cycle assessment for the environmental impacts. However, a large fraction of studies relied on much simpler methods. The emissions of greenhouse gases was the first impact category studied, while the impact on biodiversity was rarely evaluated (only 5% of the articles dealt with it), as was the impact on air quality or human health. Overall, the substitution of fossile fuels by biofuels was deemed beneficial even when factoring in LUC effects, but a significant fraction of the studies concluded to the opposite, or to variable outcomes depending on the characteristics of the bio-based value-chain assessed. Some clear-cut trends emerged, such an adverse impact of biomass development on biodiversity or an increase in water consumption. Establishing perennial species presented a more favorable profile than other types of feedstocks. There is a need to widen the scope of LUC studies beyond liquid biofuels, to assess multiple criteria simultaneously, and to improve and harmonize the assessment methodologies.

AB  - Background
   Compelling evidence has demonstrated that a large proportion of investment in biomedical research is wasted; this waste is avoidable. Academic institutions have, thus far, shown limited response to recommendations for increasing value and reducing waste. We formulated an academic response by (i) achieving consensus across a wide range of stakeholder groups on a comprehensive framework for quality of patient-oriented clinical research and (ii) highlighting first successful examples of its operationalization to facilitate waste-reducing strategies at academic institutions.
   Methods and findings
   Based on a systematic review of quality definitions, concepts, and criteria in the medical literature (systematic MEDLINE search up to February 15, 2015, with independent and in duplicate article selection) and on stakeholder websites from 13 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States), we systematically developed a comprehensive framework for the quality of clinical research. We identified websites through personal contacts with experts in clinical research or public health who also suggested, for each country, websites of the following 7 stakeholder groups: patient organizations; academic research infrastructures; governmental bodies; regulatory agencies; ethics committees; the pharmaceutical industry; and funding agencies. In addition, we searched websites of inter-or supranational bodies involved in clinical research until no further insights emerged. After consolidation of the identified definitions, concepts, and criteria of quality in a basic framework structure, we conducted 4 rounds of an adapted online Delphi process among the same 7 stakeholder groups from 16 countries. The Delphi process ultimately achieved consensus on structure and content. The framework addresses 5 study stages (concept, planning and feasibility, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and reporting and knowledge translation) and includes the following dimensions: (i) protection of patient safety and rights, (ii) relevance/patient centeredness and involvement, (iii) minimization of bias (internal validity), (iv) precision, (v) transparency/access to data, and (vi) generalizability (external validity) of study results. These dimensions interact with 2 promoters-infrastructure and sustainability through education-that include a set of factors that may enhance all listed quality dimensions. Each quality dimension contains specific questions and explanatory items that guide quality assessment at each research stage from conceptualization of the research question through reporting and knowledge translation of study results. In the last survey round, Delphi participants from 9 countries (Austria, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, and US) agreed on the structure, content, and wording of the research stages, quality dimensions, specific questions, and descriptive examples of the final framework. In Switzerland, INQUIRE has resulted in a roadmap that guides initiatives to increase value within the Swiss Clinical Trial Organization network and through affiliated researchers.
   Conclusions
   We present a framework based on a consensus of different stakeholder groups guiding the practical assessment of clinical research quality at all stages of a research project. Operationalization of this common structure will support the increase of value by guiding academic institutions and researchers in developing quality enhancement initiatives, from posing the right research question to the transparent publication of results.

TI  - Assessing the multiple benefits of partially protected marine protected areas in Australia: A systematic review protocol
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - AGE
AB  - BackgroundThere is global pressure to protect more of the world's oceans, primarily to protect biodiversity, and to fulfill the "30 by 30" goal set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that has recently been ratified under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework at the fifteenth Conference of Parties (COP-15). Fully protected marine protected areas (MPAs) provide the highest level of protection for biodiversity from destructive or extractive practices and may limit access to the area itself. Fully protected MPAs (also commonly referred to as 'no-take MPAs') ban all fishing activities, thereby removing the realisation of direct economic and social benefits from resource extraction within these areas. However, fully protected MPAs can still act as source of productivity to surrounding areas, while also providing an important scientific reference role for off-reserve management thereby providing indirect economic and social outcomes, as well as biodiversity benefits. Sustainable marine resource management strives to achieve 'triple-bottom line' benefits, where economic, social, and biodiversity benefits are maximised in managed areas of the ocean. Implementing 'partially protected' areas (PPAs) in areas of high biodiversity value (i.e., inshore, productive areas of the ocean) that allow for some extractive activities, may allow us to supplement fully MPAs to meet IUCN conservation goals, while maximising social and economic benefits. However, our current understanding lacks explicit quantitative assessments of whether and how PPAs can benefit (or otherwise) biodiversity, while also providing economic and social benefits. This study provides a method to systematically review the scientific and legislative literature to understand how PPAs may contribute to conserving biodiversity while also providing social and economic benefits to Australia. Methods and expected outputsThe implementation of partially protected areas (PPAs) requires careful consideration of many potentially competing factors, and an understanding of the types of partial protection already in place in a region. We have developed a systematic literature review protocol focussing on the primary research question: "What is the current state of partially protected area (PPA) implementation across Australian marine areas?". The aim of the review is to provide marine resource managers with a comprehensive overview of PPAs in Australia, including associated goals and stated management strategies to achieve these goals, and a methodological approach that may be utilised globally.The review protocol was designed by the research team for a Fisheries Resource and Development Corporation (FRDC) strategic research grant and will seek input from a project steering committee for the project on aggregation of the initial results. The steering committee is made up of stakeholders from a wide range of backgrounds and interests, covering marine conservation, fisheries management, Indigenous values, and academic research in Australia. Multiple academic databases, alongside Australian Federal, State, and Territory legislation and related policies will be reviewed using Boolean keyword search strings for both academic databases and relevant grey literature. Results from eligible documents will be compiled and insights from the review collated to provide information on the status of PPA implementation in Australia.

AB  - The prevalence and intensity of parasites in wild hosts varies across space and is a key determinant of infection risk in humans, domestic animals and threatened wildlife. Because the immune system serves as the primary barrier to infection, replication and transmission following exposure, we here consider the environmental drivers of immunity. Spatial variation in parasite pressure, abiotic and biotic conditions, and anthropogenic factors can all shape immunity across spatial scales. Identifying the most important spatial drivers of immunity could help pre-empt infectious disease risks, especially in the context of how large-scale factors such as urbanization affect defence by changing environmental conditions. We provide a synthesis of how to apply macroecological approaches to the study of ecoimmunology (i.e. macroimmunology). We first review spatial factors that could generate spatial variation in defence, highlighting the need for large-scale studies that can differentiate competing environmental predictors of immunity and detailing contexts where this approach might be favoured over small-scale experimental studies. We next conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the frequency of spatial studies and to classify them according to taxa, immune measures, spatial replication and extent, and statistical methods. We review 210 ecoimmunology studies sampling multiple host populations. We show that whereas spatial approaches are relatively common, spatial replication is generally low and unlikely to provide sufficient environmental variation or power to differentiate competing spatial hypotheses. We also highlight statistical biases in macroimmunology, in that few studies characterize and account for spatial dependence statistically, potentially affecting inferences for the relationships between environmental conditions and immune defence. We use these findings to describe tools from geostatistics and spatial modelling that can improve inference about the associations between environmental and immunological variation. In particular, we emphasize exploratory tools that can guide spatial sampling and highlight the need for greater use of mixed-effects models that account for spatial variability while also allowing researchers to account for both individual- and habitat-level covariates. We finally discuss future research priorities for macroimmunology, including focusing on latitudinal gradients, range expansions and urbanization as being especially amenable to large-scale spatial approaches. Methodologically, we highlight critical opportunities posed by assessing spatial variation in host tolerance, using metagenomics to quantify spatial variation in parasite pressure, coupling large-scale field studies with small-scale field experiments and longitudinal approaches, and applying statistical tools from macroecology and meta-analysis to identify generalizable spatial patterns. Such work will facilitate scaling ecoimmunology from individual- to habitat-level insights about the drivers of immune defence and help predict where environmental change may most alter infectious disease risk.

AB  - BackgroundAmong the most widely predicted climate change-related impacts to biodiversity are geographic range shifts, whereby species shift their spatial distribution to track their climate niches. A series of commonly articulated hypotheses have emerged in the scientific literature suggesting species are expected to shift their distributions to higher latitudes, greater elevations, and deeper depths in response to rising temperatures associated with climate change. Yet, many species are not demonstrating range shifts consistent with these expectations. Here, we evaluate the impact of anthropogenic climate change (specifically, changes in temperature and precipitation) on species' ranges, and assess whether expected range shifts are supported by the body of empirical evidence.MethodsWe conducted a Systematic Review, searching online databases and search engines in English. Studies were screened in a two-stage process (title/abstract review, followed by full-text review) to evaluate whether they met a list of eligibility criteria. Data coding, extraction, and study validity assessment was completed by a team of trained reviewers and each entry was validated by at least one secondary reviewer. We used logistic regression models to assess whether the direction of shift supported common range-shift expectations (i.e., shifts to higher latitudes and elevations, and deeper depths). We also estimated the magnitude of shifts for the subset of available range-shift data expressed in distance per time (i.e., km/decade). We accounted for methodological attributes at the study level as potential sources of variation. This allowed us to answer two questions: (1) are most species shifting in the direction we expect (i.e., each observation is assessed as support/fail to support our expectation); and (2) what is the average speed of range shifts?Review findingsWe found that less than half of all range-shift observations (46.60%) documented shifts towards higher latitudes, higher elevations, and greater marine depths, demonstrating significant variation in the empirical evidence for general range shift expectations. For the subset of studies looking at range shift rates, we found that species demonstrated significant average shifts towards higher latitudes (average = 11.8 km/dec) and higher elevations (average = 9 m/dec), although we failed to find significant evidence for shifts to greater marine depths. We found that methodological factors in individual range-shift studies had a significant impact on the reported direction and magnitude of shifts. Finally, we identified important variation across dimensions of range shifts (e.g., greater support for latitude and elevation shifts than depth), parameters (e.g., leading edge shifts faster than trailing edge for latitude), and taxonomic groups (e.g., faster latitudinal shifts for insects than plants).ConclusionsDespite growing evidence that species are shifting their ranges in response to climate change, substantial variation exists in the extent to which definitively empirical observations confirm these expectations. Even though on average, rates of shift show significant movement to higher elevations and latitudes for many taxa, most species are not shifting in expected directions. Variation across dimensions and parameters of range shifts, as well as differences across taxonomic groups and variation driven by methodological factors, should be considered when assessing overall confidence in range-shift hypotheses.
   In order for managers to effectively plan for species redistribution, we need to better account for and predict which species will shift and by how much. The dataset produced for this analysis can be used for future research to explore additional hypotheses to better understand species range shifts.

AB  - Subterranean ecosystems are among the most widespread environments on Earth, yet we still have poor knowledge of their biodiversity. To raise awareness of subterranean ecosystems, the essential services they provide, and their unique conservation challenges, 2021 and 2022 were designated International Years of Caves and Karst. As these ecosystems have traditionally been overlooked in global conservation agendas and multilateral agreements, a quantitative assessment of solution-based approaches to safeguard subterranean biota and associated habitats is timely. This assessment allows researchers and practitioners to understand the progress made and research needs in subterranean ecology and management. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature focused on subterranean ecosystems globally (terrestrial, freshwater, and saltwater systems), to quantify the available evidence-base for the effectiveness of conservation interventions. We selected 708 publications from the years 1964 to 2021 that discussed, recommended, or implemented 1,954 conservation interventions in subterranean ecosystems. We noted a steep increase in the number of studies from the 2000s while, surprisingly, the proportion of studies quantifying the impact of conservation interventions has steadily and significantly decreased in recent years. The effectiveness of 31% of conservation interventions has been tested statistically. We further highlight that 64% of the reported research occurred in the Palearctic and Nearctic biogeographic regions. Assessments of the effectiveness of conservation interventions were heavily biased towards indirect measures (monitoring and risk assessment), a limited sample of organisms (mostly arthropods and bats), and more accessible systems (terrestrial caves). Our results indicate that most conservation science in the field of subterranean biology does not apply a rigorous quantitative approach, resulting in sparse evidence for the effectiveness of interventions. This raises the important question of how to make conservation efforts more feasible to implement, cost-effective, and long-lasting. Although there is no single remedy, we propose a suite of potential solutions to focus our efforts better towards increasing statistical testing and stress the importance of standardising study reporting to facilitate meta-analytical exercises. We also provide a database summarising the available literature, which will help to build quantitative knowledge about interventions likely to yield the greatest impacts depending upon the subterranean species and habitats of interest. We view this as a starting point to shift away from the widespread tendency of recommending conservation interventions based on anecdotal and expert-based information rather than scientific evidence, without quantitatively testing their effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Property rights to natural resources comprise a major policy instrument in efforts to advance sustainable resource use and conservation. Debate over the relative effectiveness of different property rights regimes in reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the links between property rights regimes and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence from the past two decades on the environmental impacts of property rights regimes in fisheries, forests and range-lands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and community property regimes, as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive, negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influence effect of property rights regimes on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three languages, resulting in a total of 34,984 screened titles.
   Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 property regime studies: 55% of the studies related to forestry, 31% to fisheries, and 14% to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case-control studies but presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. We found that property regime comparisons differed across resource domains with, for example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmental outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pressure, and the presence or absence of clear, stable and legitimate rights (i.e. 'positive regime characteristics').
   Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclusions about the environmental impacts of different property rights regimes within or across resource systems. The majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on property rights regimes would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe property rights regime characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: This guideline provides recommendations for the clinical management of schizophrenia and related disorders for health professionals working in Australia and New Zealand. It aims to encourage all clinicians to adopt best practice principles. The recommendations represent the consensus of a group of Australian and New Zealand experts in the management of schizophrenia and related disorders. This guideline includes the management of ultra-high risk syndromes, first-episode psychoses and prolonged psychoses, including psychoses associated with substance use. It takes a holistic approach, addressing all aspects of the care of people with schizophrenia and related disorders, not only correct diagnosis and symptom relief but also optimal recovery of social function.
   Methods: The writing group planned the scope and individual members drafted sections according to their area of interest and expertise, with reference to existing systematic reviews and informal literature reviews undertaken for this guideline. In addition, experts in specific areas contributed to the relevant sections. All members of the writing group reviewed the entire document. The writing group also considered relevant international clinical practice guidelines. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated when the writing group judged that there was sufficient evidence on a topic. Where evidence was weak or lacking, consensus-based recommendations were formulated. Consensus-based recommendations are based on the consensus of a group of experts in the field and are informed by their agreement as a group, according to their collective clinical and research knowledge and experience. Key considerations were selected and reviewed by the writing group. To encourage wide community participation, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists invited review by its committees and members, an expert advisory committee and key stakeholders including professional bodies and special interest groups.
   Results: The clinical practice guideline for the management of schizophrenia and related disorders reflects an increasing emphasis on early intervention, physical health, psychosocial treatments, cultural considerations and improving vocational outcomes. The guideline uses a clinical staging model as a framework for recommendations regarding assessment, treatment and ongoing care. This guideline also refers its readers to selected published guidelines or statements directly relevant to Australian and New Zealand practice.
   Conclusions: This clinical practice guideline for the management of schizophrenia and related disorders aims to improve care for people with these disorders living in Australia and New Zealand. It advocates a respectful, collaborative approach; optimal evidence-based treatment; and consideration of the specific needs of those in adverse circumstances or facing additional challenges.

AB  - Over the past decades, organizations have faced challenges in retaining good employees due to market competition and talent scarcity, thereby forcing leaders to improve their human resource strategies. Organizations often source exclusive talent development instead of nurturing talent inclusively. Exclusive refers to organizations' tendency to hire top talents outside their organi-zation when needs arise, or if they have to look for candidates within the organization, only those identified as performers within their elite pool are selected. Literature suggests that inclusive talent development (i.e., career development via training for all employees regardless of indi-vidual performance) can complement management for employee retention. The present study carries out a systematic review of articles published from 1997 to 2020 pertaining to talent development, particularly inclusive nurturing, to enable frugal human resource management, i.e., developing human resource inclusive talent development (ITD) in a resource constrained envi-ronment. We address three major questions: to what degree is talent development (TD) repre-sented in the wider talent management (TM) literature?; how does ITD contribute to individual talent growth and organizational performance?; and what are the limitations of current research on ITD? A total of 48 articles on TD, with 13 articles on ITD, are analyzed to provide theoretical and practical insights. This review presents research gaps on inclusive TD, and highlights future research directions, such as wider coverage to develop a more comprehensive scope, TD for low performers to improve their individual growth and organizational performance, application of frugal innovation through ITD, and association with resource-based view - valuable, rare, inimitability, and organized model (RBV-VRIO). While ITD coupled with other TM activities has significant effect on individual growth and organizational performance, the evidence for and discussion of this concept remains scarce. The research contributes to existing HRM literatures: (1) TD is a limited area of research and has minority representation within TM literature; (2) ITD is becoming increasingly crucial for individual talent growth and organizational performance towards a sustainable competitive advantage as primed by the RBV - VRIO model; and (3) key limitations of research on TD include one-sided perspectives to TD, lack of balance between in-dividual talent growth and organizational performance, and other methodological weaknesses.

AB  - Background
   Community participation is a major principle of people centered health systems, with considerable research highlighting its intrinsic value and strategic importance. Existing reviews largely focus on the effectiveness of community participation with less attention to how community participation is supported in health systems intervention research.
   Objective
   To explore the extent, nature and quality of community participation in health systems intervention research in low- and middle-income countries.
   Methodology
   We searched for peer-reviewed, English language literature published between January 2000 and May 2012 through four electronic databases. Search terms combined the concepts of community, capability/participation, health systems research and low- and middle-income countries. The initial search yielded 3,092 articles, of which 260 articles with more than nominal community participation were identified and included. We further excluded 104 articles due to lower levels of community participation across the research cycle and poor description of the process of community participation. Out of the remaining 160 articles with rich community participation, we further examined 64 articles focused on service delivery and governance within health systems research.
   Results
   Most articles were led by authors in high income countries and many did not consistently list critical aspects of study quality. Articles were most likely to describe community participation in health promotion interventions (78%, 202/260), even though they were less participatory than other health systems areas. Community involvement in governance and supply chain management was less common (12%, 30/260 and 9%, 24/260 respectively), but more participatory. Articles cut across all health conditions and varied by scale and duration, with those that were implemented at national scale or over more than five years being mainstreamed by government. Most articles detailed improvements in service availability, accessibility and acceptability, with fewer efforts focused on quality, and few designs able to measure impact on health outcomes. With regards to participation, most articles supported community's in implementing interventions (95%, n = 247/260), in contrast to involving communities in identifying and defining problems (18%, n = 46/260). Many articles did not discuss who in communities participated, with just over a half of the articles disaggregating any information by sex. Articles were largely under theorized, and only five mentioned power or control. Majority of the articles (57/64) described community participation processes as being collaborative with fewer describing either community mobilization or community empowerment. Intrinsic individual motivations, community-level trust, strong external linkages, and supportive institutional processes facilitated community participation, while lack of training, interest and information, along with weak financial sustainability were challenges. Supportive contextual factors included decentralization reforms and engagement with social movements.
   Conclusion
   Despite positive examples, community participation in health systems interventions was variable, with few being truly community directed. Future research should more thoroughly engage with community participation theory, recognize the power relations inherent in community participation, and be more realistic as to how much communities can participate and cognizant of who decides that.

AB  - Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, provide vital support for human life, but overloading nutrients to the Earth system leads to environmental concerns, such as water and air pollution on local scales and climate change on the global scale. With an urgent need to feed the world's growing population and the growing concern over nutrient pollution and climate change, sustainable nutrient management has become a major challenge for this century. To address this challenge, the growing body of research on nutrient budgets, namely the nutrient inputs and outputs of a given system, has provided great opportunities for improving scientific knowledge of the complex nutrient cycles in the coupled human and natural systems. This knowledge can help inform stakeholders, such as farmers, consumers, and policy makers, on their decisions related to nutrient management. This paper systematically reviews major challenges, as well as opportunities, in defining, quantifying, and applying nutrient budgets. Nutrient budgets have been defined for various systems with different research or application purposes, but the lack of consistency in the system definition and its budget terms has hindered intercomparison among studies and experience-sharing among researchers and regions. Our review synthesizes existing nutrient budgets under a framework with five systems (i.e., Soil-Plant system, Animal system, Animal-Plant-Soil system, Agro-Food system, and Landscape system) and four spatial scales (i.e., Plot and Farm, Watershed, National, and Global scales). We define these systems and identify issues of nitrogen and phosphorus budgets within each. Few nutrient budgets have been well balanced at any scale, due to the large uncertainties in the quantification of several major budget terms. The type and level of challenges vary across spatial scales and also differ among nutrients. Improvement in nutrient budgets will rely not only on the technological advancement of scientific observations and models but also on better bookkeeping of human activity data. While some nutrient budget terms may need decades, or even centuries, of research to be well quantified within desirable levels of uncertainties, it is imperative to effectively communicate to interested stakeholders our understanding of nutrient budgets so that scientists and a variety of stakeholders can work together to address the sustainable nutrient management challenge of this century.
   Plain Language Summary Managing nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is fundamental, yet challenging, for sustainable development. Nutrients are critical for plant and animal growth in agriculture and in nonagricultural ecosystems and are consequently important for food security and climate stability, as well as human health. However, historical and ongoing increases in nutrient inputs to agriculture, while increasing food production, have also contributed to severe environmental problems, ranging from local water and air pollution to global climate change. Quantifying the nutrient inputs and outputs of a farm, watershed, or any other well-defined boundary advances our knowledge of how to maintain a nutrient balance, which is an essential step toward sustainable nutrient management. So far, many research efforts have been devoted to quantifying nutrient budgets and to improving nutrient management for different systems (e.g., farms and food supply chains) and at different spatial scales (e.g., from a single farm to the entire world). However, due to the complex nature of nutrient cycles and incomplete data sets, challenges remain in quantifying and understanding nutrient budgets to inform policies and actions for sustainable nutrient management. With a systematic review of major challenges in defining, quantifying, and applying nutrient budgets, this paper calls for collective efforts by researchers, farmers, watershed managers, consumers, policy makers, and other stakeholders involved in nutrient management to improve our ability to balance nutrient budgets and to use that understanding to grow abundant food while avoiding pollution.

AB  - Background: Nearly 15% of pregnancies end in fatal perinatal obstetric complications including bleeding, infections, hypertension, obstructed labour and complications of abortion. Globally, an estimated 10.7 million women have died due to obstetric complications in the last two decades, and two thirds of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Though the majority of maternal mortalities can be prevented, different factors can hinder women's access to emergency obstetric services. Therefore, this review is aimed at synthesizing current evidence on barriers to access and utilization of emergency obstetric care in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: Articles were searched from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Maternity and Infant Care databases using predefined search terms and strategies. Articles published in English, between 2010 and 2017, were included. Two reviewers (AG and AM) independently screened the articles, and data extraction was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction format. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The identified barriers were qualitatively synthesized and reported using the Three Delays analytical framework. The PRISMA checklist was employed to present the findings.
   Result: The search of the selected databases returned 3534 articles. After duplicates were removed and further screening undertaken, 37 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The identified key barriers related to the first delay included younger age, illiteracy, lower income, unemployment, poor health service utilization, a lower level of assertiveness among women, poor knowledge about obstetric danger signs, and cultural beliefs. Poorly designed roads, lack of vehicles, transportation costs, and distance from facilities led to the second delay. Barriers related to the third delay included lack of emergency obstetric care services and supplies, shortage of trained staff, poor management of emergency obstetric care provision, cost of services, long waiting times, poor referral practices, and poor coordination among staff.
   Conclusions: A number of factors were found to hamper access to and utilization of emergency obstetric care among women in sub-Saharan Africa. These barriers are inter-dependent and occurred at multiple levels either at home, on the way to health facilities, or at the facilities. Therefore, country-specific holistic strategies including improvements to healthcare systems and the socio-economic status of women need to be strengthened. Further research should focus on the assessment of the third delay, as little is known about facility-readiness.

AB  - Background: Digital technology is a means to uphold or violate human rights in various domains, including business, military, and health. Given the pervasiveness of mobile technology in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), mobile health (mHealth) interventions present an opportunity to reach remote populations and enable them to exercise civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to health and education. Simultaneously, the ubiquity of mobile phones involves processing sensitive data which can threaten rights, including the right to privacy and nondiscrimination. Digital health is often promoted as advancing human rights and health equity; however, digital rights are underexplored in the literature on mHealth in LMICs. As such, creating an understanding of the digital rights topics covered in the 2022 literature is important to avoid exacerbating existing inequities relating to digital health design, use, implementation, and access.Objective: This scoping review aims to identify digital rights topics in the 2022 peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs.Methods: The Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews guides this review. Searches were performed across 7 electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and PubMed). The screening processes were guided by the research question "What digital rights topics have been explored in the 2022 literature on mHealth in LMICs?" Only papers addressing mHealth in LMICs and digital rights topics were included. Data extraction will include publication title, year, and type; first author's affiliation country; LMICs implicated; infrastructure challenges; study aims, design, limitations, and future work; health area; mHealth technology, functions, purpose or application, and target end users; human or digital right terms used; explicit rights topics cited; and implied rights topics. The results will be reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist.Results: This scoping review was registered in Open Science Framework (December 22, 2022). Title and abstract screening and full-text paper screening were completed in 2023. This resulted in 56 papers being included in the study. The target date for completing data extraction and publishing a case study of the initial findings is the end of 2023. The full scoping review findings are expected to be disseminated through various pathways benefiting academia, practice, and policy making by the end of 2024. These include journal papers, conference presentations, publicly available toolkits for research and practice, public webinars, and policy briefs with evidence-based policy recommendations emerging from this review.Conclusions: The planned scoping review will identify digital rights topics in the 2022 literature at the intersection of mHealth and LMICs. Furthermore, it will highlight the importance of patient empowerment, data protection, and inclusion in mHealth research and related policies in LMICs.

AB  - Background Cigarette smoking is one of the most preventable causes of morbidities and mortalities. Since 2005, the World Health Organization Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) provides an efficient strategic plan for tobacco control across the world. Many countries in the world have successfully reduced the prevalence of cigarette smoking. However, in developing countries, the prevalence of cigarette smoking is mounting which signifies a need of prompt attention. This scoping review aims to explore the extent and nature of Smoking Cessation (SmC) interventions and associated factors in South Asian Region (SAR) by systematically reviewing available recently published and unpublished literature. Methods The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework frames the conduct of this scoping review. PubMed, EBSCO CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and local websites as well as other sources of grey literature were searched for relevant literature. In total, 573 literature sources were screened. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, finally, 48 data sources were included for data extraction and analysis. We analyzed the extracted SmC interventions through the FCTC. Factors that affect smoking cessation interventions will be extracted through manual content analysis. Results Regarding FCTC recommended smoking cessation strategies (articles), most of the articles were either neglected or addressed in a discordant way by various anti-smoking groups in SAR. Key barriers that hamper the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions included lack of awareness, poor implementation of anti-smoking laws, and socio-cultural acceptance of tobacco use. Conversely, increased levels of awareness, through different mediums, related to smoking harms and benefits of quitting, effective implementation of anti-smoking laws, smoking cessation trained healthcare professionals, support systems, and reluctance in the community to cigarette smoking were identified as facilitators to smoking cessation interventions. Conclusion The ignored or uncoordinated FCTC's directions on smoking cessation strategies have resulted in continued increasing prevalence of cigarette smoking in developing countries, especially SAR. The findings of this review highlight the need for refocusing the smoking cessation strategies in SAR. Strengths The review was conducted by a team of expert comprising information specialists, and senior professors bringing rich experience in systematic and scoping reviews. Every effort was made to include all available literature sources addressing cigarette SmC and associated factors in SAR. The review findings signal the need and direction for more SmC efforts in SAR which may contribute to development of effective policies and guidelines for the control of smoking prevalence. Limitations Despite efforts, potentially relevant records may have been missed due to unpublished or inaccessible articles, unintended selection bias, or those published in local languages, etc. Moreover, the exclusion of literature on under 18 participants and mentally ill smokers may limit the generalizability of findings.

AB  - Aquaculture has experienced spectacular growth in the past decades, during which continuous innovation has played a significant role, but it faces increasing criticism regarding its ecological and social sustainability practices and the resulting challenges for future innovation processes. However, in the aquaculture literature, there is limited systematic knowledge of how innovation has been approached in terms of how the focus and the scope of aquaculture innovation processes are understood and managed. The objective of this paper is therefore to analyse the different approaches to innovation used in aquaculture development. We conducted a systematic review of the aquaculture literature, using an analytical lens derived from three main bodies of literature on approaches to conceptualize and manage innovation: Technology-driven, Systemic, and Business and Managerial approaches to innovation. One hundred publications were selected from the aquaculture literature covering the topic of aqua culture innovation. Analysis identified the Transfer of Technology approach as still the predominant approach to aquaculture innovation; and, even with the integration of elements of Systemic approaches, most studies remain focused on the farm level and are technology driven. Multi-dimensional studies, integrating technical, biophysical, political, and institutional dimensions of innovation in aquaculture were found, but studies analysing interactions between levels remain scarce, have a strong emphasis on the institutional dimension, and lack focus on the management of the innovation process. Studies with cross-fertilizations between different approaches to aquaculture innovation are limited but address specific research questions regarding the extent to which specific target groups are included in interventions and the need to incorporate diverse dimensions in analysing innovation processes. Our analysis suggests that aquaculture research and technology design that feeds into aquaculture innovation could benefit from innovation management approaches that integrate constant feedback from users, especially when specific groups are being targeted for better inclusiveness, and thus could better foster multi-directional interactions between multiple actors connected to aquaculture systems. This would help to elevate the analysis from just the farm and improve the integration of institutional, political, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions for better management of the innovation process. The study of aquaculture innovation needs to take into consideration the important role of private sector actors and make better use of systemic approaches to further elucidate the multi-dimensional and multi-level interplays in complex aquaculture systems. Ultimately, interdisciplinary research on aquaculture innovation could deliver significant insights supporting the development of a resilient and sustainable aquaculture sector.
   Statement of relevance: Using an analytical lens derived from the literature on innovation approaches, this study systematically analyses approaches to innovation used in aquaculture development. We identify the main trends and existing gaps in aquaculture innovation research and then discuss the potential complementarities between different approaches to innovation in order to better understand and support innovation in the aquaculture sector.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has thrust video consulting into the limelight, as health care practitioners worldwide shift to delivering care remotely. Evidence suggests that video consulting is acceptable, safe, and effective in selected conditions and settings. However, research to date has mostly focused on initial adoption, with limited consideration of how video consulting can be mainstreamed and sustained.
   Objective: This study sought to do the following: (1) review and synthesize reported opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned in the scale-up, spread, and sustainability of video consultations, and (2) identify transferable insights that can inform policy and practice.
   Methods: We identified papers through systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Included articles reported on synchronous, video-based consultations that had spread to more than one setting beyond an initial pilot or feasibility stage, and were published since 2010. We used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to synthesize findings relating to 7 domains: an understanding of the health condition(s) for which video consultations were being used, the material properties of the technological platform and relevant peripherals, the value proposition for patients and developers, the role of the adopter system, organizational factors, wider macro-level considerations, and emergence over time.
   Results: We identified 13 papers describing 10 different video consultation services in 6 regions, covering the following: (1) video-to-home services, connecting providers directly to the patient; (2) hub-and-spoke models, connecting a provider at a central hub to a patient at a rural center; and (3) large-scale top-down evaluations scaled up or spread across a national health administration. Services covered rehabilitation, geriatrics, cancer surgery, diabetes, and mental health, as well as general specialist care and primary care. Potential enablers of spread and scale-up included embedded leadership and the presence of a telehealth champion, appropriate reimbursement mechanisms, user-friendly technology, pre-existing staff relationships, and adaptation (of technology and services) over time. Challenges tended to be related to service development, such as the absence of a long-term strategic plan, resistance to change, cost and reimbursement issues, and the technical experience of staff. There was limited articulation of the challenges to scale-up and spread of video consultations. This was combined with a lack of theorization, with papers tending to view spread and scale-up as the sum of multiple technical implementations, rather than theorizing the distinct processes required to achieve widespread adoption.
   Conclusions: There remains a significant lack of evidence that can support the spread and scale-up of video consulting. Given the recent pace of change due to COVID-19, a more definitive evidence base is urgently needed to support global efforts and match enthusiasm for extending use.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: How did the field of stem cell research develop in the years following the derivation of the first human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Supported by the increasing number of clinical trials to date, significant technological advances in the past two decades have brought us ever closer to clinical therapies derived from pluripotent cells.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since their discovery 20 years ago, the use of human pluripotent stem cells has progressed tremendously from bench to bedside. Here, we provide a concise review of the main keystones of this journey and focus on ongoing clinical trials, while indicating the most relevant future research directions.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a historical narrative, including relevant publications in the field of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) derivation and differentiation, recounted both through scholarly research of published evidence and interviews of six pioneers who participated in some of the most relevant discoveries in the field.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The authors all contributed by researching the literature and agreed upon body of works. Portions of the interviews of the field pioneers have been integrated into the review and have also been included in full for advanced reader interest.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The stem cell field is ever expanding. We find that in the 20 years since the derivation of the first hESC lines, several relevant developments have shaped the pluripotent cell field, from the discovery of different states of pluripotency, the derivation of induced PSC, the refinement of differentiation protocols with several clinical trials underway, as well as the recent development of organoids. The challenge for the years to come will be to validate and refine PSCs for clinical use, from the production of highly defined cell populations in clinical grade conditions to the possibility of creating replacement organoids for functional, if not anatomical, function restoration.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a non-systematic review of current literature. Some references may have escaped the experts' analysis due to the exceedingly diverse nature of the field. As the field of regenerative medicine is rapidly advancing, some of the most recent developments may have not been captured entirely.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The multi-disciplinary nature and tremendous potential of the stem cell field has important implications for basic as well as translational research. Recounting these activities will serve to provide an in-depth overview of the field, fostering a further understanding of human stem cell and developmental biology. The comprehensive overview of clinical trials and expert opinions included in this narrative may serve as a valuable scientific resource, supporting future efforts in translational approaches.

AB  - Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes.
   Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis.
   Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had "control-impact" design, only two studies used "before-after-controlimpact" design, and one study used "before-after" design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads.
   Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.

AB  - Background: Shallow nearshore marine ecosystems are changing at an increasing rate due to a range of human activities such as urbanisation and commercial development. As a result, an increasing number of structural modifications occur in coastal nursery and spawning habitats of fish. Concomitant to this increase, there have been declines in many coastal fish populations and changes in the composition of fish communities. As requested by Swedish stakeholders, this review aimed to synthesise scientific evidence of the impact on fish recruitment of structural modifications in temperate coastal areas.
   Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature on such impacts in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish. Searches were performed in bibliographic databases, specialist websites, bibliographies of review articles. We also contacted stakeholder to find relevant literature. Eligible studies included small- and large-scale field studies in marine systems and large lakes (> 10,000 km(2)) in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Included replicated comparisons of fish recruitment between altered and unaltered control areas, comparisons before and after an alteration, or both. Relevant outcomes (response variables) included measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juvenile fish in coastal habitats. All fish species were considered. Articles were screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text. Eligible studies were critically appraised based on their external and internal validity. From each eligible study of sufficient validity, we extracted information on study design, measured outcomes, exposure, type of comparator, effect modifiers and study findings. Study findings were synthesised narratively.
   Results: We searched for eligible studies in 15 databases, 24 specialist websites, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of 11 review articles. The review finally included 37 studies that were eligible and of sufficient validity to be considered for final synthesis. Most studies (23 of 37) were from the Northern Hemisphere. Studies varied in design, spatial resolution, target fish species, and type of structural habitat change. This high level of variation did not allow for a quantitative synthesis and prevented us from drawing general conclusions on the impact of structures or structural modifications on fish recruitment. In this review we provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base and classify eligible studies into six categories (based on type of exposure and comparator). The categories are as follows: the impacts on fish recruitment of: (1) artificial structures in coastal areas, (2) structures designed as fish attractors, (3) large scale urban sprawl, (4) 'novel' habitats, (5) habitat loss, and (6) restoration.
   Conclusions: This review revealed a very limited evidence base for how structural modifications and marine urban sprawl can affect fish recruitment. Thus, there is a substantial mismatch between stakeholder needs and research evidence. Further, the impact and ecological performance of artificial structures depend both on context and species. Clearly, there is a need for more research on the subject, especially on long-term consequences at larger spatial scales.

AB  - The number of scientific publications about serious games has exponentially increased, often surpassing human limitations in processing such a large volume of information. Consequently, the importance of frameworks for summarising such fast-expanding literature has also grown. This paper draws a panorama of serious game research streams, focusing on higher education in engineering and management. The research design involves a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines, along with bibliometric and content analyses. The sample comprises 701 documents collected from both Scopus and Web of Science databases. For supporting bibliometric analyses, Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny tools are employed. In addition, a coding schema is developed for in-depth analysis of 701 documents selected according to the inclusion criteria. In short, the literature on serious games for engineering and management education grows more rapidly than modern science, following a globalised, collaborative and context-based trajectory. The results reveal five main research streams: game design guidelines, game design cases, game experiment guidelines, game experiment cases and generalists. These streams are summarised in a proposed framework. Cross-tabulation and statistical analyses conducted in SPSS Statistics identify the key relationships amongst the research streams. Finally, opportunities to investigate serious games for sustainable development education arise, and there is a need for future efforts to formalise the framework classification algorithm.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicScientific production related to Serious Games (SGs) has grown exponentially in a globalised manner. It reflects the interest from various domains, particularly the field of sustainability in management.Literature reviews on SGs have emphasised various topics, including the acceptance of simulations and games as effective methods of teaching and learning. The role of technology-enhanced games and simulations in the context of digital transformation in education and the emergence of sustainability as a promising field for future SGs research are also highlighted.The literature has introduced three categories for empirical research on SGs: (1) game presentation, (2) game evaluation and (3) game effectiveness. It has also highlighted methodological rigour as a common challenge across studies.What this paper addsScientific research on SGs in Engineering and Management Higher Education (EMHE) experiences exponential and significantly faster growth compared to modern science in a globalised and collaborative manner. This growth reveals the scarcity of experts in this area and attracts the attention of various fields, particularly in the realm of sustainability.Thematic trajectories indicate a decline in discussions regarding users' perceptions of SGs and their validity as educational tools. They also demonstrate consistency in discussions about SGs design, and the potential of sustainability emerges as a promising area for future SGs in EMHE.A comprehensive framework composed by five primary research streams connects game design cases and guidelines, game experiment cases and guidelines and generalists. This framework can serve as a lens for future context-based literature reviews, and the relationships amongst its streams reinforce the idea that the field can benefit from increased methodological rigour in experiments.
   Implications for practice and/or policyThis review offers categorised supplementary material in which educators can discover a variety of artefacts for application in their specific educational contexts. Designers can access guidelines for enhancing the design of innovative games. Researchers can access guidelines for more effective evaluation of their artefacts across various contexts. Finally, policymakers can explore numerous experiments to inform decisions related to technology-enhanced innovations in the classroom.

AB  - Purpose Future scenarios and life cycle assessment (LCA) are powerful tools that can provide early sustainability assessments of novel products, technologies and systems. The combination of the two methods involves practical and conceptual challenges, but formal guidance and consensus on a rigorous approach are currently missing. This study provides a comprehensive overview of how different topic areas use future scenarios and LCA in order to identify useful methods and approaches, and to provide overall recommendations. Methods This study carried out a systematic literature review that involved searching for peer-reviewed articles on Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct, utilising a rigorous set of keywords for future scenarios and for LCA. We identified 514 suitable peer-reviewed articles that were systematically analysed according to pre-defined sets of characteristics for the combined modelling of future scenarios and LCA. Results and discussion The numbers of studies combining future scenarios and LCA increase every year and in all of the 15 topic areas identified. This combination is highly complex, due to different sequences in the modelling between future scenarios and LCA, the use of additional models and topic area-specific challenges. We identify and classify studies according to three archetypal modelling sequences: input, output and hybrid. More than 100 studies provide methods and approaches for combining future scenarios and LCA, but existing recommendations are specific to topic areas and for modelling sequences, and consensus is still missing. The efficacy of many studies is hampered by lack of quality. Only half of the articles complied with the LCA ISO standards, and only one quarter demonstrated consistent knowledge of future scenario theory. We observed inconsistent use of terminology and a considerable lack of clarity in the descriptions of methodological choices, assumptions and time frames. Conclusions and Recommendations The combined use of future scenarios and LCA requires formal guidance, in order to increase clarity and communicability. Guidance should provide unambiguous definitions, identify minimum quality requirements and produce mandatory descriptions of modelling choices. The goal and scope of future scenarios and LCA should be in accordance, and quality should be ensured both for the future scenarios and the LCA. In particular, future scenarios should always be developed contextually, to ensure effective assessment of the problem at hand. Guidance should also allow for maintaining current modelling complexity and topic area differences. We provide recommendations from the reference literature on terminology, future scenario development and the combined use of future scenarios and LCA that may already constitute preliminary guidance in the field. Information collected and recommendations provided will assist in a more balanced development of the combined use of future scenarios and LCA in view of the urgent challenges of sustainable development.

AB  - Plain language summary Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and practices by adolescent females of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are severe problems for girls, parents, society, and policymakers. Menstrual-related problems are widespread among adolescent girls in India. Different menstrual abnormalities are found in different populations, suggesting socio-cultural and regional variation. Menstrual abnormalities and disorders are frequently linked to physical, mental, social, psychological, and reproductive issues, affecting adolescents' daily lives and their families lives by various psychosocial problems such as anxiety. We have the intention to compile, summarise, and critically analyse peer-reviewed and published scientific evidence from 2011 to 2021 on menstrual hygiene management methods used, most typical menstrual morbidities and their associated factors among Indian adolescent girls, and to evaluate the evidence for existing interventions like educational programs and absorbent distribution. Program planners and policymakers could use the findings of this study to build relevant initiatives to incorporate safe MHM in the country so that interventions can be designed taking into account the current needs of adolescent girls to reduce menstrual morbidities and improve their quality of life. A statistically significant improvement in knowledge and practice on menstruation was observed. Learning about menstrual hygiene and health is an essential aspect of adolescent girls' health education to continue working and maintaining hygienic habits. Infections of the reproductive system and their repercussions can be avoided with better awareness and safe menstruation practices.
   Background Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and practices by adolescent females of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are a severe public health issue. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled proportion of the hygiene practices, menstrual problems with their associated factors, and the effectiveness of educational interventions on menstrual hygiene among adolescent school girls in India. Methods PRISMA checklist and PICO guidelines were used to screen the scientific literature from 2011 to 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of studies. Four themes were developed for data analysis, including hygiene practices, type of absorbent used, menstruation associated morbidities and interventions performed regarding menstruation. Eighty-four relevant studies were included and a meta-analysis, including subgroup analysis, was performed. Results Pooled data revealed a statistically significant increase in sanitary pad usage "(SMD = 48.83, 95% CI = 41.38-57.62, p < 0.00001)" and increased perineum practices during menstruation "(SMD = 55.77, 95% CI = 44.27-70.26, p < 0.00001)". Results also reported that most prevalent disorders are dysmenorrhea "(SMD = 60.24, 95% CI = 50.41-70.06, p < 0.0001)", Pre-menstrual symptoms "(SMD = 62.67, 95% CI = 46.83-78.50, p < 0.00001)", Oligomenorrhea "(SMD = 23.57, CI = 18.05-29.10, p < 0.00001), Menorrhagia "(SMD = 25.67, CI = 3.86-47.47, p < 0.00001)", PCOS "(SMD = 5.50, CI = 0.60-10.40, p < 0.00001)", and Polymenorrhea "(SMD = 4.90, CI = 1.87-12.81, p < 0.0001)". A statistically significant improvement in knowledge "(SMD = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.75-3.36, p < 0.00001)" and practice "(SMD = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.13-2.65, p < 0.00001)" on menstruation was observed. Infections of the reproductive system and their repercussions can be avoided with better awareness and safe menstruation practices. Conclusions Learning about menstrual hygiene and health is essential for adolescent girls' health education to continue working and maintaining hygienic habits. Infections of the reproductive system and their repercussions can be avoided with better awareness and safe menstruation practices.

AB  - The increased antibiotic resistance and diversity of resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lead to serious problems in treatment. Bacterial resistance against antibiotics can be influenced by patient characteristics, antibiotic usage policy depending on the country, region, hospital, clinics and even may vary during treatment. In this meta-analysis study, we aimed to evaluate the trends in P.aeruginosa antibiotic resistance over the past 11 years. The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the literature search method, criteria for inclusion and exclusion, evaluation of publications, data collection, and statistical analysis were performed. To identify relevant publications, two national databases (ULAKBIM and TURK MEDLINE) and one international database (Pub Med) were searched. Published manuscripts were evaluated for exclusion criteria, after the study data were collected, and statistical analyses were performed. The data obtained from the literature were assessed under a common unit. The calculations made in the 95% confidence interval value of p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As a result of exclusion criteria, meta-analysis was performed for 48 studies published between 2003 and 2013. For the evaluation of the changes in antibiotic resistance of P.aeruginosa isolates over time, studies were divided into three groups according to the year of publication. The number of publications was relatively consistent over the course of the study period with 17 studies published in 2003-2006; 14 in 2007-2009, and 17 in 2010-2013. There were significant changes in antibiotic resistance results within years however, none of these differences were statistically significant (p> 0.05). Carbapenem resistance, especially imipenem resistance, increased between 2007 and 2009, however, the changes were not statistically significant for either imipenem or meropenem (p= 0.254, p= 0.499, respectively). Through the 11-year period, the resistance rates for imipenem and meropenem were 29.4% and 32.1%, respectively. In the last 4 years of the study period, notable decrease were reported in antibiotic groups except for cefepime from cephalosporins and monobactam; the resistance rates for cephalosporins remained unchanged during this time period. The reported resistance rates for cefepime and ceftazidime were 41.4% and 43.9%, respectively. Similar decreases in resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin, were also seen, however, these changes were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). The current data suggested that antibiotic resistance in P.aeruginosa has a tendency to decrease in our country. Though being at the bottom of the ladder, it can be expressed that rational and restricted use of antibiotics policy, contributed to the strength of the decrease; however for the decline of resistance to a reasonable level, new and sustainable policy is necessary to be implemented.

AB  - Research conducted on food systems by higher institutions can contribute to sustainable food security and nutrition at a local level and reduce the impact of societal challenges such as malnutrition. Unfortunately, malnutrition itself manifests as hidden hunger causing unintended consequences such as illness negatively affecting economic progress. Traditionally, research in agriculture has not taken a food systems approach which is looking at challenges of food systems from farm to fork (all stages from production to consumption). Therefore, as we embrace the compelling call to transition from agriculture to food systems research approaches, mapping studies at a local level are needed. However, studies on food systems have been carried out at a macro (global or regional level), a micro-perspective investigation is needed to inform future research. A systematic review on existing literature (journals and thesis) was conducted to identify gaps and opportunities in research on food systems undertaken by researchers at the University of Nairobi. Information collected included; 1. institutions (faculties and department at the university, national policy, and international institutions collaborating with university of Nairobi), 2. crop types (cereals, legumes, vegetables, roots and tubers, and nuts), 3. food systems activities (production, postharvest, processing, and preservation, value addition and branding, consuming foods, input and output markets, obtaining nutrients as well as logistics and distribution) driving research on food systems. The contribution of each of the components (institutions, food systems activity and crop type) was also investigated through citation scores. The findings show that low research outputs on food systems were generated by the university of Nairobi compared to selected universities in Africa and across the globe. Research was focused on carbohydrate rich crops (maize, sorghum, cassava, irish potato, sweet potato, and rice) as compared to protective bioactive vitamin crops (vegetables, mango, and beans). This demonstrated low crop diversity and dietary quality. Research priority was given mainly to maize compared to traditional crops such as sorghum, African Leafy Vegetables, cassava and millets. Faculties such as health, science and technology, engineering, and humanities were involved in research in food systems in addition to agriculture, a potential indication of transdisciplinary research. Additionally, there was more collaborative research between university of Nairobi with institutions at a global level than with local institutions. The involvement of policy institutions in research was low, mainly restricted to the discipline of agriculture, production food system activity and in a few crops such as maize, cassava, and medicinal plants. Disparities in research existed along the food systems activities as more attention was focused on production activities. Other food system activities such as harvesting, processing and preservation, consumption, value addition and branding, input and output markets, as well as logistics and distribution activities, received low research priority. Each component (food system activity, crop type and institution) demonstrated contribution to sustainable food security as shown by citation scores. The findings demonstrate skewed focus in food systems research at the university of Nairobi.
   Agricultural research investment within institutions of higher learning will need to consider all food systems activities, under-researched crops and collaborations that advance transdisciplinary studies to promote inclusive contribution of food systems to food security at a local level. Further studies can focus on developing frameworks to advance transdisciplinary research.

AB  - Background: Clinicians manage midportion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) using complex clinical reasoning underpinned by a rapidly developing evidence base.
   Objectives: The objectives of the study were to develop an inclusive, accessible review of the literature in combination with an account of expert therapists' related clinical reasoning to guide clinical practice and future research.
   Methods: Searches of the electronic databases, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were conducted for all papers published from inception to November 2011. Reference lists and citing articles were searched for further relevant articles. Inclusion required studies to evaluate the effectiveness of any conservative intervention for midportion AT. Exclusion criteria included in vitro, animal and cadaver studies and tendinopathies in other locations (e.g. patella, supraspinatus). From a total of 3497 identified in the initial search, 47 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies were scored according to the PEDro scale, with a score of >= 8/10 considered of excellent quality, 5-7/10 good, and <= 4/10 poor. The strength of evidence supporting each treatment modality was then rated as 'strong', 'moderate', 'limited', 'conflicting' or 'no evidence' according to the number and quality of articles supporting that modality. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with physiotherapists to explore clinical reasoning related to the use of various interventions with and without an evidence base, and their perceptions of available evidence.
   Results: Evidence was strong for eccentric loading exercises and extracorporeal shockwave therapy; moderate for splinting/bracing, active rest, low-level laser therapy and concentric exercises (i.e. inferior to eccentric exercise). In-shoe foot orthoses and therapeutic ultrasound had limited evidence. There was conflicting evidence for topical glycerin trinitrate. Taping techniques and soft-tissue mobilization were not yet examined but featured in case studies and in the interview data. Framework analysis of interview transcripts yielded multiple themes relating to physiotherapists' clinical reasoning and perceptions of the evidence, including the difficulty in causing pain while treating the condition and the need to vary research protocols for specific client groups - such as those with the metabolic syndrome as a likely etiological factor. Physiotherapists were commonly applying the modality with the strongest evidence base, eccentric loading exercises. Barriers to research being translated into practice identified included the lack of consistency of outcome measures, excessive stringency of some authoritative reviews and difficulty in accessing primary research reports. The broad inclusion criteria meant some lower quality studies were included in this review. However, this was deliberate to ensure that all available research evidence for the management of midportion AT, and all studies were evaluated using the PEDro scale to compensate for the lack of stringent inclusion criteria.
   Conclusion: Graded evidence combined with qualitative analysis of clinical reasoning produced a novel and clinically applicable guide to conservative management of midportion AT. This guide will be useful to novice clinicians learning how to manage this treatment-resistant condition and to expert clinicians reviewing their evidence-based practice and developing their clinical reasoning. Important areas requiring future research were identified including the effectiveness of orthoses, the effectiveness of manual therapy, etiological factors, optimal application of loading related to stage of presentation and how to optimize protocols for different types of patients such as the older patient with the metabolic syndrome as opposed to the athletically active.

AB  - Background: Linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, powerlines and waterways) generate well documented fragmenting effects on species habitats. However, the potential of verges of linear transportation infrastructures (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of constant loss of natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for compensating the loss of biodiversity they generated have to be considered. This paper is the first synthesis of evidence addressing this topic for vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) in temperate ecosystems.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature survey using two online publication databases, three search engines, specialist websites, and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. We successively screened the articles for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize the retained studies and to critically appraise them. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for vertebrates, and the effects of landscape and management on these potentialities. We critically appraised all studies to assess their risk of bias and created a database of the studies with low and medium risk of bias. We synthesized results for each specific question in narrative syntheses. Finally, studies that met meta-analysis requirements were used for quantitative syntheses.
   Results: Our initial searches identified 83,565 documents. After critical appraisal, we retained 119 documents that reported 128 studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (49%) and in the United States of America (22%), and were about mammals (61%) and birds (20%). Results from the narrative synthesis and meta-analyses converged and revealed that the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges to constitute a habitat for vertebrate species varies according to the infrastructure and the biological group considered. Especially, highway verges may be a refuge for small mammals but seems detrimental to birds. The potential also varied depending on the landscape considered, with urbanisation being related to lower biodiversity hosted by verges. We found a wide variety of verge management practices with few studies on each practice, which prevented us from drawing general conclusions. Likewise, we found too few studies assessing the corridor potential of verges to be able to fully conclude although this potential seems to exist. We did not find any study assessing the effect of landscape context or management on the role of corridor of verges.
   Conclusions: We identified a major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for vertebrates, and when they exist studies rarely directly measured movements on verges. We thus encourage more research on this topic and the development of protocols that enable direct measures of vertebrate movements. The effect of management practices on the role of habitat of verges also deserves further investigations, and research efforts should be coordinated to focus on one specific practice (e.g. vegetation management).

AB  - Background Many indigenous people have died or been harmed because of inadequately monitored research. Strong regulations in Human Research Ethics (HRE) are required to address these injustices and to ensure that peoples' participation in health research is safe. Indigenous peoples advocate that research that respects indigenous principles can contribute to addressing their health inequities. This scoping literature review aims to analyze existing peer reviewed and grey literature to explore how indigenous values and principles from countries of Oceania are incorporated into HRE and the governance of research involving human participants. Methods A scoping literature review framework was used for this study. A search for peer reviewed and grey literature from Google, bibliographies, and electronic databases such as SCOPUS, SPRINGER, Medline (Ovid) and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted, limited to the years 2002-2020. Sixty (60) documents that focused on indigenous knowledge from Oceania region and HRE were included, from which key findings and themes were synthesized. Results Charting the data showed that more than half the eligible documents were peer-reviewed journal articles (54%). Other sources included: International Declarations on Human Research (8%); book chapters (8%); government documents (8%); HRE Guidelines or protocols (13%); news articles (7%) and PhD thesis (2%). The literature was from Australia, Cook Islands, Guam, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu, some of which focused specifically on HREs in the Pacific Region. Issues emerging from the literature were grouped into five themes (i) indigenous and cultural principles of HRE; (ii) informed consent in indigenous settings in Oceania; (iii) vulnerability and minority status of indigenous populations exploited for research; (iv) research ethics governance for Oceania indigenous peoples; and (v) research ethics committees in Oceania. Respect, relationship building, and trust were priority indigenous HRE principles that encompass the principles of partnership, capacity building, reciprocity, and equality. Relationship building and trust imply the equal distribution of benefits for indigenous population and researchers. Conclusion Indigenous principles of HRE identified were interconnected and interdependent. Recommendations were to incorporate indigenous principles of research in HRE regulations and processes of all countries with indigenous populations. This is especially pertinent for emerging national research committees in LMIC countries, including Fiji and Tonga. Relationship building among researchers and indigenous populations is key to successful research with indigenous populations. HRE principles important for relationship building include respect that is reciprocal among researchers and indigenous people. Elements of the principle of respect highlighted are empathy, collaboration, sharing of benefits, reciprocity, appreciation, empowerment, protection, safety and awareness of culture and languages. Indigenous ontology from the Oceania region involves spirituality, connectedness to land, religious beliefs and a participatory approach to HRE and should be respected in research. An ethical governance mechanism of HRE is one that incorporates indigenous principles and applications for the purpose of maximizing the protection of the dignity and rights of indigenous peoples of Oceania.

AB  - BackgroundResearch studies demonstrate that palliative care can improve patient outcomes such as quality of life, symptom burden and patient satisfaction with care (Gomes B, et al. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of home palliative care services for adults with advanced illness and their caregivers. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013(6):CD00776) (World Health Organization. Palliative Care. Published 2020.). While 76% of patients who need palliative care live in limited-resource countries, access to high quality palliative services in these countries is minimal (Worldwide Hospice and Palliative Care Association and World Health Organization. Global Atlas of Palliative Care (2nd ed). 2020.). In 2014 the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance, with strong endorsement by the WHO, released the Palliative Care Toolkit to provide a training and implementation toolkit for empowering community members to deliver palliative care in resource poor settings (Worldwide Hospice and Palliative Care Association and World Health Organization. Global Atlas of Palliative Care at the End of Life. Geneva, Switzerland 2014.). They encouraged researchers and public health practitioners to conduct rigorous evaluation of the toolkit in diverse settings and contexts. To address this need, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine implementation and explore potential effect of an intervention based upon the Palliative Care Toolkit, as adapted and used by community health workers (CHWs) working with a cancer center in Kolkata, India to deliver home-based palliative care for rural patients.MethodsUtilizing a randomized controlled trial design, intervention patients (n = 45) receive home-based palliative services (Pal-Care) delivered by community health workers (CHWs), with comparison against a control group of patients (n = 45) who receive usual cancer-center-based palliative services. Primary outcome measures include evaluation of CHW training outcomes, roles and responsibilities of the CHWS and how they assist patients, trial recruitment, stakeholder perceptions of the intervention, and fidelity to study protocol. Secondary outcomes measure patient self-report of health-related quality of life, symptom burden, palliative needs and patient care experience, outcomes The RE-AIM framework guides our evaluation plan to measure the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the Pal-Care intervention (Gaglio B, et al. The RE-AIM framework: a systematic review of use over time. Am J Public Health. 2013;103(6):e38?46.). Data will be analyzed in SAS. All measures will be evaluated overall and by patient age, gender and cancer type and by CHW caseload.DiscussionPal-Care is a RCT funded by the NCI to explore utilization of CHWs to deliver a home-based palliative care intervention built upon the WHO Palliative Care toolkit (PCT), as compared to a usual care control group. The long-term goal of this research is to develop an effective and sustainable model for delivering home-based palliative care for cancer patients in underserved areas.Trial registration (TRN)ClinicalTrials.gov ID# NCT04972630.

AB  - Author summaryModifying people's risk practices through behaviour change (BC) interventions can strengthen schistosomiasis control. Disease transmission can be interrupted by controlling peoples' exposure to infected water, open defaecation practices, and by fostering treatment acceptance. We reviewed peer-reviewed publications released before June 2021 to assess the effectiveness of BC projects in decreasing risk practices and disease prevalence. 32 publications reporting on 31 projects based in Low- and Middle-Income countries were fully examined. Projects used four approaches: health education (HEIs), social-environmental (SEIs), physical-environmental (PEIs), and incentives-centred interventions (ICIs). Available data could not assert which approach was most effective in reducing risk behaviour. Structural barriers limited HEIs' effects, whilst community social and material conditions affected those of SEIs. Both demanded comprehensive infrastructure investments. The cost-effectiveness of ICIs, in turn, remain unclear. Limited evidence of independent epidemiological impacts from BC was found. Indicative evidence, however, shows that BC projects could sustain gains attained through treatment activities. Overall, investment in integrated interventions appear needed to address exposure and transmission behaviour, whilst a context-driven strategic use of HEIs or SEIs appears useful to prompt treatment uptake. Despite BC's potential, treatment activities appear essential for epidemiological effects.
   BackgroundFor the last two decades, schistosomiasis control efforts have focussed on preventive treatment. The disease, however, still affects over 200 million people worldwide. Behaviour change (BC) interventions can strengthen control by interrupting transmission through modifying exposure behaviour (water contact) or transmission practices (open urination/defaecation); or through fostering treatment seeking or acceptance. This review examines these interventions to assess their effectiveness in modifying risk practices and affecting epidemiological trends. Methodology/Principal findingsA systematic multi-database literature search (PROSPERO CRD42021252368) was conducted for peer-reviewed publications released at any time before June 2021 assessing BC interventions for schistosomiasis control in low- and middle-income countries. 2,593 unique abstracts were identified, 66 were assigned to full text review, and 32 met all inclusion criteria.A typology of intervention models was outlined according to their use of behaviour change techniques and overarching rationale: health education (HEIs), social-environmental (SEIs), physical-environmental (PEIs), and incentives-centred interventions (ICIs). Available evidence does not allow to identify which BC approach is most effective in controlling risk behaviour to prevent schistosomiasis transmission. HEIs' impacts were observed to be limited by structural considerations, like infrastructure underdevelopment, economic obligations, socio-cultural traditions, and the natural environment. SEIs may address those challenges through participatory planning and implementation activities, which enable social structures, like governance and norms, to support BC. Their effects, however, appear context-sensitive. The importance of infrastructure investments was highlighted by intervention models. To adequately support BC, however, they require users' inputs and complementary services. Whilst ICIs reported positive impacts on treatment uptake, there are cost-effectiveness and sustainability concerns. Evaluation studies yielded limited evidence of independent epidemiological impacts from BC, due to limited use of suitable indicators and comparators. There was indicative evidence, however, that BC projects could sustain gains through treatment campaigns. Conclusions/SignificanceThere is a need for integrated interventions combining information provision, community-based planning, and infrastructure investments to support BC for schistosomiasis control. Programmes should carefully assess local conditions before implementation and consider that long-term support is likely needed. Available evidence indicates that BC interventions may contribute towards schistosomiasis control when accompanied by treatment activities. Further methodologically robust evidence is needed to ascertain the direct epidemiological benefits of BC.

AB  - Background: Obesity is linked to a number of chronic health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, and weight loss interventions are often expensive. Recent systematic reviews concluded that app and web-based interventions can improve lifestyle behaviors and weight loss at a reasonable cost, but long-term sustainability needs to be demonstrated.
   Objective: This study protocol is for a 2-year randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the clinical and economic effects of a primary care, anchored, collaborative, electronic health (eHealth) lifestyle coaching program (long-term Lifestyle change InterVention and eHealth Application [LIVA] 2.0) in obese participants with and without type 2 diabetes. The program's primary outcome is weight loss. Its secondary outcome is the hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level, and its tertiary outcomes are retention rate, quality of life (QOL), and cost effectiveness. Analytically, the focus is on associations of participant characteristics with outcomes and sustainability.
   Methods: We conduct a multicenter trial with a 1-year intervention and 1-year retention. LIVA 2.0 is implemented in municipalities within administrative regions in Denmark, specifically eight municipalities located within the Region of Southern Denmark and two municipalities located within the Capital Region of Denmark. The participants are assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Individual data from the LIVA 2.0 platform are combined with clinical measurements, questionnaires, and participants' usage of municipality and health care services. The participants have a BMI >= 30 but <= 45 kg/m2, and 50% of the participants have type 2 diabetes. The participants are randomized in an approximately 60:40 manner, and based on sample size calculations on weight loss and intention-to-treat statistics, 200 participants are randomized to an intervention group and 140 are randomized to a control group. The control group is offered the conventional preventive program of the municipality, and it is compared to the intervention group, which follows the LIVA 2.0 in addition to the conventional preventive program.
   Results: The first baseline assessments have been carried out in March 2018, and the 2-year follow-up will be carried out between March 2020 and April 2021. The hypothesis is that the trial results will demonstrate decreased body weight and that the number of patients who show normalization of their HbA1c levels in the intervention group will be much higher than that in the control group. The participants in the intervention group are also expected to show a greater decrease in their use of glucose-lowering medication and a greater improvement in their QOL when compared with the control group. Operational costs are expected to be lower than standard care, and the intervention is expected to be cost-effective.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that an app and web-based eHealth lifestyle coaching program implemented in Danish municipalities will be clinically and economically evaluated. If the LIVA 2.0 eHealth lifestyle coaching program is proven to be effective, there is great potential for decreasing the rates of obesity, diabetes, and related chronic diseases.

AB  - Introduction: Morbidity and mortality from heart disease continues to be high in Australia with cardiac rehabilitation (CR) recognised as best practice for people with heart disease. CR is known to reduce mortality, reoccurrence of heart disease, hospital readmissions and costs, and to improve quality of life. Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Australian First Peoples or Indigenous peoples) have a greater need for CR due to their higher burden of disease. However, CR referral, access and attendance remain low for all people who live in rural and remote areas. The aim of this integrative review was to identify barriers, enablers and pathways to CR for adults living independently in rural and remote areas of high-income countries, including Australia.
   Methods: Studies were identified through five online data bases, plus reference lists of the selected studies. The studies focused on barriers and enablers of CR for adults in rural and remote areas of Australia and other high-income countries, in English peer reviewed journals (2007-2016). A mix of qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies were reviewed through a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA), followed by a critical review and thematic analysis.
   Results: Sixteen studies were selected: seven qualitative, four quantitative and five mixed method. Five themes that influence CR attendance were identified: referral, health services pathways and planning; cultural and geographic factors necessitating alternative and flexible programs; professional roles and influence; knowing, valuing, and psychosocial factors; and financial costs - personal and health services. Factors identified that impact on referral and access to CR were hospital inpatient education programs on heart disease and risk factors; discharge processes including CR eligibility criteria and referral to ensure continuum and transition of care; need for improved accessibility of services, both geographically and through alternative programs, including home based with IT and/or telephone support Also, the need to ensure that health professionals understand, value and support CR; the impact of mental health, coping with change and competing priorities; costs including travel, medications and health professional consultations; as well as low levels of involvement of Australian First Peoples in their own care and poor cultural understanding by non-Australian First Peoples staff all negatively impact on CR access and attendance.
   Conclusion: This study found weak systems with low referral rates and poor access to CR in rural and remote areas. Underlying factors include lack of health professional and public support, often based on poor perception of benefits of CR, compounded by scarce and inflexible services. Low levels of involvement of Australian First Peoples, as well as a lack of cultural understanding by non-Australian First Peoples staff, is evident Overall, the findings demonstrate the need for improved models of referral and access, greater flexibility of programs and professional roles, with management support Further, increased education and involvement of Australian First Peoples, including Indigenous health workers taking a lead in their own people's care, supported by improved education and greater cultural awareness of non Australian First Peoples staff, is required.

AB  - Wildfires are known to be one of the main causes of soil erosion and land degradation, and their impacts on ecosystems and society are expected to increase in the future due to changes in climate and land use. It is therefore vital to mitigate the increased hydrological and erosive response after wildfires to maintain the sustainability of ecosystems and protect the values at risk downstream from the fire-affected areas. Soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires but assessment of their effectiveness has been limited to local and regional-scale studies, whose conclusions may depend heavily on site-specific conditions. To overcome this limitation, a meta-analysis approach was applied to investigations of post-wildfire soil erosion mitigation treatments published in peer-reviewed journals.
   A meta-analysis database was compiled that consisted of 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, extracted from 34 publications indexed in Scopus. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as the quantitative metric 'effect size', was determined for both the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (cover-based, barriers, seeding, and chemical treatments). The erosion observations involving cover-based treatments were analyzed for differences in effectiveness between 3 different types of mulch materials (straw, wood-based, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood materials. Finally, the erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effectiveness of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover.
   The meta-analysis results show that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the cover and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the three different cover treatments, straw and wood mulches were significantly more effective in mitigating erosion than hydromulch. In addition, the effectiveness of both straw and wood mulches depended on their application rates. Straw mulching was less effective at rates below than above 200 g m- 2, while mulching with wood materials at high rates (1300 to 1750 g m-2) produced more variable outcomes than lower rates. Results also suggest that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and that it increased with increasing rainfall erosivity. It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, the metaanalysis highlights under-representation of studies on this topic outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. It was also observed that most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching (namely straw, wood and hydromulch) and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were scarcely addressed. Further efforts need to be made in testing, from field and modeling studies, combinations of existing and/or emerging erosion mitigation treatments to ensure that the most adequate measures are applied after fires.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse key determinants of Polish consumers' loyalty, identified through the analysis of relationship marketing literature, with reference to traditional foodstuffs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper's approach is a systematic review of the Web of Science, Ebsco and Pro-Quest electronic databases, from 1990 to 2014 as well as research results run by Polish and international research centres, groups and institutes. The paper focuses on two main aspects. One is connected with the development of traditional foodstuffs being a consequence of growing prosperity of the Polish society, and the emergence of consumers who rate quality, national/regional identity and own cultural values higher than the price. The other one is connected with key determinants of consumer loyalty towards traditional products. The paper uses secondary data, and presents research results run between Polish consumers of traditional food products. Attitudes and behaviour of Polish consumers of traditional products in relation to key determinants of loyalty, such as attitude towards the product, the level of satisfaction, trust, price sensitivity and frequency of purchase and willingness to do repeat purchase are identified in the paper.
   Findings - According to the analysed research, almost 90 percent of the respondents positively perceive traditional products. The results of the research confirm positive and emotional attitudes of consumers towards traditional products. This emotional attachment, which is very important in creating loyalty among consumers, makes them buy traditional food. Polish consumers are satisfied with the taste of traditional products, which are also perceived as fresh and natural. Consumers rate the quality of traditional products highly and underline their positive influence on their and their families' health. According to the research, Polish consumers pay little attention to geographical and quality indications, which are designed to build a trustworthy image of the products. Traditional products are perceived as expensive, which makes it difficult to build loyalty and affects the frequency of purchase. Almost 40 percent of the respondents buy traditional products once a month.
   Practical implications - The research results presented in the paper have significant implications for management, that is producers and retailers of local food, in particular with regard to their future marketing effort. Producers and entrepreneurs should monitor behaviour of consumers of traditional food to adapt their offer to changing trends in order to create their loyalty. Consumers expect the products to be made of appropriate ingredients and production methods in order to keep their original taste and character. They also expect some product innovations and proper communication to become loyal.
   Social implications - The paper has significant implications for society. The process of building customer loyalty towards traditional products is important in the context of their quality of life and public attitude. Traditional foods are a part of culture and the identity of the population where they are produced. Therefore they carry a strong symbolic value for the customers. They are also perceived as healthy and nutritious products, containing a lot of vitamins and minerals. Creating loyal attitude towards them may improve the quality of customers' life.
   Originality/value - The paper provides interesting insights about loyalty for traditional products. Based on the determinants of loyalty identified by the author in relationship marketing literature the analysis of these variables was conducted in relation to traditional products. Due to the best author knowledge this is one of the first attempts, if not the first, where loyalty determinants were described in relation to traditional products. The literature lacks comprehensive research on particular aspects of loyal behaviour in the market of traditional products.

AB  - Introduction: Approximately 20% of healthcare workers in high-income countries such as Australia, Canada and the USA work in rural areas. Healthcare workers are known to be vulnerable to occupational injury and poor work disability outcomes; given their rural-urban distribution, it is possible to compare work disability prevention in rural and urban areas. However, little attention has been paid to work disability prevention issues specific to rural workers, including rural healthcare workers. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify rural-urban differences in work disability outcomes (defined as the incidence of occupational injury and the duration of associated work absence), as well as risk factors for poor work disability outcomes in rural healthcare workers.
   Methods: The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched, as were relevant research centers and government agencies, to identify all quantitative and qualitative English-language studies published between 1 January 2000 and 6 October 2009 that discussed occupational injury, work absence duration, work disability management, or risk factors for poor work disability outcomes, for rural workers specifically, or in comparison with urban workers. To ensure inclusion of studies of healthcare workers as a distinct group among other sector-specific groups, a broad search for literature related to all industrial sectors was conducted.
   Results: Of 860 references identified, 5 discussed work disability outcomes and 25 discussed known risk factors. Known risk factors were defined as factors firmly established to be associated with poor work disability outcomes in the general worker population based on systematic reviews, well-established conceptual models of work disability prevention, and public health literature. Although somewhat conflicting, the evidence suggests that rural healthcare workers experience higher rates of occupational injury compared with urban healthcare workers, within occupational categories. Rural workers also appear to be more vulnerable to prolonged work absence although the data are limited. No studies directly compared risk factors for work disability prevention outcomes between rural and urban healthcare workers. However, potential risk factors were identified at the level of the environment, worker, job, organization, worker compensation system and healthcare access. Important methodological limitations were noted, including unclear definitions of rurality, inadequate methods of urban-rural comparisons such as comparing samples from different countries, and a paucity of studies applying longitudinal or multivariate designs.
   Conclusions: There is a notable lack of evidence about work disability prevention issues for healthcare workers in rural areas. Available evidence supports the hypothesis that rural healthcare workers are vulnerable to occupational injury, and suggests they are vulnerable to prolonged work absence. They may be particularly vulnerable to poor work disability prevention outcomes due to complex patient needs in the context of risk factors such as heavy workloads, long hours, heavy on-call demands, high stress levels, limited support and workplace violence. Additional vulnerability may occur because their work conditions are managed in distant urban administrative centers, and due to barriers in their own healthcare access. Although rural healthcare workers seem generally at greater risk of injury, one study suggests that urban emergency medical service workers experience a high vulnerability to injury that may outweigh the effects of rurality. Additional research is needed to document rural-urban disparities in work disability outcomes and to identify associated sources and risk factors. Other issues to address are access to and quality of healthcare for rural healthcare workers, streamlining the compensation system, the unique needs of Aboriginal healthcare workers, and the management of prolonged work absence. Finally, occupational injury and work absence duration programs should be tailored to meet the needs of rural workers.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents unique challenges in health care, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach.
   Methods: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions.
   Results: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines.
   Conclusions: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.

AB  - The increasing population, improving living standards, and expanding economic activities are responsible for rising water demands. In recent decades, the imbalance between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent. Coupled with the unreasonable use of water resources, this has led to serious water scarcity problems that affect the sustainable development of modern society. Under this background. water scarcity has become an important environmental issue for our sustainable planet. Water scarcity is affected by regional water resource endowments and the ways in which water resources are developed and utilized by human beings. Quantity-induced water scarcity occurs when the quantity of water resources is insufficient. Meanwhile, pollution can cause water scarcity as the services provided by polluted water are not equivalent to that of clean water. Quality-induced water scarcity occurs when the pollutants exceed the environmental carrying capacity.
   Since Marlin Falkenmark first proposed the concept and assessment method of water scarcity in the 1980s, water scarcity assessment has developed for nearly 40 years. With the development of new theories, progress has been made. such as development of different approaches for assessing water scarcity, identification of influencing factors of water scarcity, revealing the formation mechanism, and exploring strategies to cope with water scarcity. As a result, water scarcity assessment has experienced an evolutionary pathway from a one-dimensional model emphasizing only quantity-induced water scarcity to a two-dimensional model (considering both quantity-induced and quality-induced water scarcity), toward a three-dimensional (3D) model (or 3D water scarcity theory) that considers water quantity, water quality, and environmental flows simultaneous.
   Based on a systematic review of water scarcity assessment in the literature, this study demonstrates the 3D water scarcity theory and elaborates on its basic concepts, principles, and core methods. The 3D water scarcity theory was first proposed by Chinese scholars and then accepted by international scholars. The quantity-induced water scarcity is assessed based on the ratio of water consumption to water availability, and the quality-induced water scarcity is quantified by comparing gray water footprint (the amount of water required to dilute pollutants in wastewater sufficiently to meet environmental water quality standards) with local available water resources. Environmental flow requirements are quantified based on the characteristics of climatic and hydrological conditions rather than the traditionally adopted simple approach by assuming that they are equal to 80% of water resources. Hence, the 3D water scarcity theory and assessment method can consider water quantity, water quality, and environmental flow requirements comprehensively.
   Finally, four main future research directions of water scarcity assessment are summarized: The further development and improvement of the theoretical framework of 3D water scarcity, applications of the assessment methods on multiple spatial scales, explicit consideration of the impacts of physical and virtual water flow, and mechanism of the evolution of water scarcity. 3D water scarcity is a key to achieving sustainable and harmonious development between humanity and water resources, and its assessment framework can break through the limitations of the traditional one- or two-dimensional models. Water scarcity theory provides methodological support for measuring the state of water resources on global, national, and regional scales, and it will help formulate appropriate water mitigation measures for integrated water resources management.

AB  - Background
   Schistosomiasis remains a global-health problem with over 90% of its burden concentrated in Africa. Field studies reflect the complex ways in which socio-cultural and socio-economic variables, affect the distribution of Schistosoma infections across different populations. This review set out to systematically investigate and quantify the differences in Schistosoma infection burdens between males and females in Africa for two of the most prevalent Schistosoma species-Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium.
   Methodology
   We searched (from inception to 11th March 2020) Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science for relevant studies on schistosomiasis. We included studies that report S. mansoni and/or S. haematobium prevalence and/or intensity data distributed between males and females. We conducted meta-analyses on the male to female (M:F) prevalence of infection ratios. Subgroup analyses were performed according to study baseline prevalence, sample size and the lower and upper age limit of study participants. We also present a descriptive analysis of differential risk and intensity of infection across males and females. Evidence for differences in the prevalence of schistosomiasis infection between males and females is presented, stratified by Schistosoma species.
   Result
   We identified 128 relevant studies, with over 200,000 participants across 23 countries. Of all the reported differences in the prevalence of infection between males and females, only 41% and 34% were statistically significant for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively. Similar proportions of studies (27% and 34% for for S. haematobium and S. mansoni, respectively) of the reported differences in intensity of infection between males and females were statistically significant. The meta-analyses summarized a higher prevalence of infection in males; pooled random-effects weighted M:F prevalence of infection ratios were 1.20 (95% CI 1.11-1.29) for S. haematobium and 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.22) for S. mansoni. However, females are underrespresented in some of the studies. Additionally, there was significant heterogeneity across studies (Higgins I-2 statistic (p-values < 0.001, I(2)values> 95%)). Results of the subgroup analysis showed that the baseline prevalence influenced the M:F prevalence ratios for S. haematobium and S. mansoni, with higher M:F prevalence of infection ratios in settings with a lower baseline prevalence of infection. Across the studies, we identified four major risk factors associated with infection rates: occupational and recreational water contact, knowledge, socio-economic factors and demographic factors. The effect of these risk factors on the burden of infection in males and females varied across studies.
   Conclusions
   We find evidence of differences in prevalence of infection between males and females which may reflect differences in gender norms and water contact activities, suggesting that policy changes at the regional level may help ameliorate gender-related disparities in schistosomiasis infection burden. Collecting, robustly analysing, and reporting, sex-disaggregated epidemiological data, is currently lacking, but would be highly informative for planning effective treatment programmes and establishing those most at risk of schistosomiasis infections.
   Author summary
   Schistosomiasis is a parasitic waterborne disease affecting more than 240 million people worldwide every year, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The difference in schistosoma infection prevalence, infection intensity and risk between males and females has rarely been quantified. In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively synthesise published studies that present sex-disaggregated epidemiological data and investigate gender differences (e.g. those driven by social and cultural norms) that predispose males or females to higher risk of infection. Based on the 123 studies included in our meta-analysis, we found a higher prevalence of Schistosoma (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) in males.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to do a thorough literature review to assess the current status of corporate sustainability practices, issues and challenges in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and, based on literature, suggest a model that can improve and strategically manage their sustainability practices in the emerging market context of Asia.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors did a meta-analysis of the reviewed literature taken from peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the time frame of 1985-2016. Methodology used by the authors is through preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis.
   Findings
   Corporate sustainability is a well-practiced area in big organisations. However, literature suggests that in case of SMEs, the situation is different. Social and environmental practices are grossly neglected in SMEs, more specifically in emerging markets. Existing literature mentions that collaborative mode of operation, government policy and facilitation and supporting organisation culture can positively influence SME's sustainability performance and hence improve their financial performance.
   Research limitations/implications
   Most of the papers in corporate sustainability literature are qualitative in nature and there is no empirical evidence of establishing this relationship in SME context. This paper tries to conceptualise the existence of a possible framework relating factors of sustainability and their role in improving business performance of the SMEs. However, the findings are purely literature-based and piloting of the questionnaire is also done on 20 SMEs in a specific geography. This is a very small and also a biased sample. Future research studies based on this paper are expected to verify the proposed relationship with larger data set catering to different industry clusters and countries.
   Practical implications
   The proposed model is only directional in nature. With the content analysis, the authors have tried to answer the research questions relating to factors of sustainability and its impact on business performance. To address the research questions in a more generalised way, an empirical research needs to be conducted to establish the research propositions. The proposed model needs to be validated and optimised with further research and data analysis. Once such a model is established, this can be proved beneficial for providing guidance to SMEs to enhance the sustainability of their business operations.
   Social implications
   The SME sector has made a significant contribution to the economic development in countries, and this sector has huge potential for growth, and their geographic spread and penetration is much higher than large organisations. Sustainable growth of this industry sector can reasonably be expected to lead to stable and sustainable development of the nation. Moreover, environmental and social best practices adopted by SMEs will also have a positive influence on society and environment in the long run.
   Originality/value
   This paper had done a geography wise analysis of sustainable practices in SMEs, and based on the recommendations and suggestions of different analyses, the authors developed few research propositions and also presented a conceptual model. Finally, to address the gap, it mentions some future research possibilities to test and validate the proposed model in the context of SMEs in emerging markets of Asia.

AB  - Background Despite tremendous progress in the pharma-cotherapy and interventional treatment for coro-nary artery disease (CAD), CAD and its complica-tions, including acute myocardial infarction (MI), remain the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. Patients undergoing high-risk per -cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and those with MI complicated by cardiogenic shock fre-quently require short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) [2, 3]. Traditionally, an intra-aor tic balloon pump (IABP) was used to assist failing left ventricle (LV) in these clinical scenarios, as it was initially demonstrated to decrease all-cause mortality, compared with unsupported PCI [4]. However, the results of subsequent clinical trials showed conflicting results regarding the beneficial effect of IABP on long-term survival [5, 6], leaving percutaneous MCS and a scope of greatly unmet needs. The Impella device (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) is a microaxial, continuous blood flow pump and the smallest catheter-based LV assist device, which provides up to 5.0 L/min cardiac output [7]. In contrast to IABP, which creates a reverse blood flow to coronary arteries during diastole, provid- ing a non-physiological MCS, Impella facilitates blood flow from the LV into the ascending aorta during systole, reducing LV preload and providing hemodynamic support in a physiological way [7]. Preliminary evidence from randomized clinical trials suggested the advantage of Impella devices over IABP, both in patients with MI complicated by cardiogenic shock and those undergoing high-risk PCI [8-10]. Despite conflicting results provided by recent systematic reviews and registry-based analyses [11-14], Impella devices have received a Class IIa recommendation (should be considered) in the recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the treatment of acute heart failure patients [15]. Whereas ESC guidelines for myocardial revascularization did not provide clear recommendations regarding the use of Impella during high-risk PCI [2], the American College of Cardiology (ACC) granted a Class IIb recommen-dation for Impella prophylactic use during elective high-risk PCI procedures [16]. Following the approval of Impella for clinical use in Europe in 2005, it has been adopted world - wide, with over 210,000 devices implanted up to date. Despite its widespread use, evidence-based data on the efficacy and safety of hemodynamic support with Impella in patients undergoing high--riskPCI and/or with cardiogenic shock are scarce. Therefore, the current landscape of Impella use is based on expert consensus, as acknowledged by recent position papers and consensus statements from various national societies [3, 17-20]. Since large randomized trials of hemodynamic support in patients undergoing high-risk PCI and with cardiogenic shock are challenging to conduct, few national registries have been launched which specifically focus on Impella devices: the Impella Italian (IMP-IT) Registry and German Impella Registry in Europe [21, 22] and the Catheter-Based Ventricular Assist Devices (cVAD) Registry in the United States (US) [23]. Considering various indications and types of Impella devices used in different countries and the lack of standardized algorithms for treatment qualification [19], it is cru-cial to establish new registries to further support decision making and form new recommendations in this challenging clinical scenario.
   Regarding the growing complexity of percuta-neous revascularization procedures in the recent decade, the use of the Impella devices have become a necessity in the interventional cardiology refer-ence centres in Poland [24]. Careful monitoring of treatment with Impella, followed by analysis of the efficacy and safety of performed procedures are crucial to determine future directions of develop-ment for this emerging technology. To fill in this gap of knowledge, the IMPELLA-PL registry has been initiated.

AB  - Background Previous global analyses, with known underdiagnosis and single cause per death attribution systems, provide only a small insight into the suspected high population health effect of sickle cell disease. Completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, this study delivers a comprehensive global assessment of prevalence of sickle cell disease and mortality burden by age and sex for 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2021. Methods We estimated cause-specific sickle cell disease mortality using standardised GBD approaches, in which each death is assigned to a single underlying cause, to estimate mortality rates from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded vital registration, surveillance, and verbal autopsy data. In parallel, our goal was to estimate a more accurate account of sickle cell disease health burden using four types of epidemiological data on sickle cell disease: birth incidence, age-specific prevalence, with-condition mortality (total deaths), and excess mortality (excess deaths). Systematic reviews, supplemented with ICD-coded hospital discharge and insurance claims data, informed this modelling approach. We employed DisMod-MR 2.1 to triangulate between these measures-borrowing strength from predictive covariates and across age, time, and geography-and generated internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality for three distinct genotypes of sickle cell disease: homozygous sickle cell disease and severe sickle cell 13-thalassaemia, sickle-haemoglobin C disease, and mild sickle cell 13-thalassaemia. Summing the three models yielded final estimates of incidence at birth, prevalence by age and sex, and total sickle cell disease mortality, the latter of which was compared directly against cause-specific mortality estimates to evaluate differences in mortality burden assessment and implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Findings Between 2000 and 2021, national incidence rates of sickle cell disease were relatively stable, but total births of babies with sickle cell disease increased globally by 13 & BULL;7% (95% uncertainty interval 11 & BULL;1-16 & BULL;5), to 515 000 (425 000-614 000), primarily due to population growth in the Caribbean and western and central sub-Saharan Africa. The number of people living with sickle cell disease globally increased by 41 & BULL;4% (38 & BULL;3-44 & BULL;9), from 5 & BULL;46 million (4 & BULL;62-6 & BULL;45) in 2000 to 7 & BULL;74 million (6 & BULL;51-9 & BULL;2) in 2021. We estimated 34 400 (25 000-45 200) cause-specific all-age deaths globally in 2021, but total sickle cell disease mortality burden was nearly 11-times higher at 376 000 (303 000-467 000). In children younger than 5 years, there were 81 100 (58 800-108 000) deaths, ranking total sickle cell disease mortality as 12th (compared to 40th for cause-specific sickle cell disease mortality) across all causes estimated by the GBD in 2021. Interpretation Our findings show a strikingly high contribution of sickle cell disease to all-cause mortality that is not apparent when each death is assigned to only a single cause. Sickle cell disease mortality burden is highest in children, especially in countries with the greatest under-5 mortality rates. Without comprehensive strategies to address morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell disease, attainment of SDG 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 is uncertain.
   Widespread data gaps and correspondingly high uncertainty in the estimates highlight the urgent need for routine and sustained surveillance efforts, further research to assess the contribution of conditions associated with sickle cell disease, and widespread deployment of evidence-based prevention and treatment for those with sickle cell disease.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of controlled clinical trial data based on research with Indigenous peoples. A lack of data specific to Indigenous peoples means that new therapeutic methods, such as those involving electronic health (eHealth), will be extrapolated to these groups based on research with other populations. Rigorous, ethical research can be undertaken in collaboration with Indigenous communities but requires careful attention to culturally safe research practices. Literature on how to involve Indigenous peoples in the development and evaluation of eHealth or mobile health apps that responds to the needs of Indigenous patients, providers, and communities is still scarce; however, the need for community-based participatory research to develop culturally safe technologies is emerging as an essential focus in Indigenous eHealth research. To be effective, researchers must first gain an in-depth understanding of Indigenous determinants of health, including the harmful consequences of colonialism. Second, researchers need to learn how colonialism affects the research process. The challenge then for eHealth researchers is to braid Indigenous ethical values with the requirements of good research methodologies into a culturally safe research protocol.
   Objective: A recent systematic review showed that Indigenous peoples are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), primarily due to a lack of attention to providing space for Indigenous perspectives within the study frameworks of RCTs. Given the lack of guidelines for conducting RCTs with Indigenous communities, we conducted an analysis of our large evaluation data set collected in the Diagnosing Hypertension-Engaging Action and Management in Getting Lower Blood Pressure in Indigenous Peoples and Low- and Middle- Income Countries (DREAM-GLOBAL) trial over a period of five years. Our goal is to identify wise practices for culturally safe, collaborative eHealth and RCT research with Indigenous communities.
   Methods: We thematically analyzed survey responses and qualitative interview/focus group data that we collected over five years in six culturally diverse Indigenous communities in Canada during the evaluation of the clinical trial DREAM-GLOBAL. We established themes that reflect culturally safe approaches to research and then developed wise practices for culturally safe research in pragmatic eHealth research.
   Results: Based on our analysis, successful eHealth research in collaboration with Indigenous communities requires a focus on cultural safety that includes: (1) building a respectful relationship; (2) maintaining a respectful relationship; (3) good communication and support for the local team during the RCT; (4) commitment to co-designing the innovation; (5) supporting task shifting with the local team; and (6) reflecting on our mistakes and lessons learned or areas for improvement that support learning and cultural safety.
   Conclusions: Based on evaluation data collected in the DREAM-GLOBAL RCT, we found that there are important cultural safety considerations in Indigenous eHealth research. Building on the perspectives of Indigenous staff and patients, we gleaned wise practices for RCTs in Indigenous communities.

AB  - There are racial/ethnic disparities in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, including delayed diagnosis, discrimination, and a lack of culturally responsive care. The perspectives of caregivers of color are critical in improving delivery of equitable care. We systematically reviewed articles pertaining to experiences with the diagnostic process among caregivers of color. We entered key terms into five databases to identify literature from 2000 to 2021. Fifteen qualitative studies met inclusion criteria, representing 253 caregivers. We used inductive methods to examine themes across racial and ethnic groups and assessed the quality of included studies. Families of color identified multiple factors that negatively affected the diagnostic process. Systems-level factors included long wait lists and financial concerns. Provider-level factors included minimization of caregiver concerns, a "wait and see" approach, biases, and lack of knowledge. Caregivers also described individual (e.g. knowledge) and family factors (e.g. stigma) that delayed diagnosis and complicated the diagnostic process. Communication barriers were commonly reported, which impeded understanding of autism spectrum disorder. Some families described providers, other individuals, community networks, and self-advocacy as facilitators. Interventions targeting systems- (e.g. Medicaid expansion) and provider-level (e.g. increase training in autism spectrum disorder) factors are needed to increase equity in the autism spectrum disorder diagnostic process. Lay abstract Children of color are diagnosed with autism later than White children. Caregivers of color are also more likely than White caregivers to report that their child's healthcare providers do not treat them as a partner, spend enough time with them, or respect their culture and values. We wanted to better understand the experiences of caregivers of color with the diagnostic process of autism spectrum disorder, from the time they discuss developmental concerns with their child's primary care provider to when the diagnosis is shared with them. We systematically reviewed the literature and found 15 articles that explored the experiences of caregivers of color. Caregivers of color described that they faced large-scale barriers, such as the cost of appointments, transportation, and long wait lists. They also reported negative experiences with providers, including providers not taking their concerns seriously, making assumptions about caregivers, and delaying referrals for an evaluation. Caregivers stated that their own lack of knowledge of autism spectrum disorder, stigma, their family's thoughts and opinions, and cultural differences between providers and caregivers served as barriers during the diagnostic process. Communication challenges were discussed and included use of medical and technical jargon, a lack of follow-up, language barriers, and difficulty obtaining high-quality interpreters. Some families described providers, other individuals, community networks, and self-advocacy as helpful during the diagnostic process. Large-scale changes are needed, such as increases in the number of providers who are trained in diagnosing Autism. Provider-level changes (e.g. implicit bias training) are also important for improving caregivers' experiences.

AB  - Introduction Achilles and patellar tendinopathy are overuse injuries that are common among athletes. Isolated eccentric muscle training has become the dominant conservative management strategy for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy but, in some cases, up to 45 % of patients may not respond. Eccentric-concentric progressing to eccentric (Silbernagel combined) and eccentric-concentric isotonic (heavy-slow resistance; HSR) loading have also been investigated. In order for clinicians to make informed decisions, they need to be aware of the loading options and comparative evidence. The mechanisms of loading also need to be elucidated in order to focus treatment to patient deficits and refine loading programmes in future studies.
   Objectives The objectives of this review are to evaluate the evidence in studies that compare two or more loading programmes in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy, and to review the non-clinical outcomes (potential mechanisms), such as improved imaging outcomes, associated with clinical outcomes.
   Methods Comprehensive searching (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and SPORTDiscus (TM)) identified 403 studies. Two authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion and quality. The final yield included 32 studies; ten compared loading programmes and 28 investigated at least one potential mechanism (six studies compared loading programmes and investigated potential mechanisms).
   Results This review has identified limited (Achilles) and conflicting (patellar) evidence that clinical outcomes are superior with eccentric loading compared with other loading programmes, questioning the currently entrenched clinical approach to these injuries. There is equivalent evidence for Silbernagel combined (Achilles) and greater evidence for HSR loading (patellar). The only potential mechanism that was consistently associated with improved clinical outcomes in both Achilles and patellar tendon rehabilitation was improved neuromuscular performance (e.g. torque, work, endurance), and Silbernagel-combined (Achilles) HSR loading (patellar) had an equivalent or higher level of evidence than isolated eccentric loading. In the Achilles tendon, a majority of studies did not find an association between improved imaging (e.g. reduced anteroposterior diameter, proportion of tendons with Doppler signal) and clinical outcomes, including all highquality studies. In contrast, HSR loading in the patellar tendon was associated with reduced Doppler area and anteroposterior diameter, as well as greater evidence of collagen turnover, and this was not seen following eccentric loading. HSR seems more likely to lead to tendon adaptation and warrants further investigation. Improved jump performance was associated with Achilles but not patellar tendon clinical outcomes. The mechanisms associated with clinical benefit may vary between loading interventions and tendons.
   Conclusion There is little clinical or mechanistic evidence for isolating the eccentric component, although it should be made clear that there is a paucity of good quality evidence and several potential mechanisms have not been investigated, such as neural adaptation and central nervous system changes (e.g. cortical reorganization). Clinicians should consider eccentric-concentric loading alongside or instead of eccentric loading in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. Good-quality studies comparing loading programmes and evaluating clinical and mechanistic outcomes are needed in both Achilles and patellar tendinopathy rehabilitation.

AB  - Recent conservation planning studies have presented approaches for integrating spatially referenced social (SRS) data with a view to improving the feasibility of conservation action. We reviewed the growing conservation literature on SRS data, focusing on elicited or stated preferences derived through social survey methods such as choice experiments and public participation geographic information systems. Elicited SRS data includes the spatial distribution of willingness to sell, willingness to pay, willingness to act, and assessments of social and cultural values. We developed a typology for assessing elicited SRS data uncertainty which describes how social survey uncertainty propagates when projected spatially and the importance of accounting for spatial uncertainty such as scale effects and data quality. These uncertainties will propagate when elicited SRS data is integrated with biophysical data for conservation planning and may have important consequences for assessing the feasibility of conservation actions. To explore this issue further, we conducted a systematic review of the elicited SRS data literature. We found that social survey uncertainty was commonly tested for, but that these uncertainties were ignored when projected spatially. Based on these results we developed a framework which will help researchers and practitioners estimate social survey uncertainty and use these quantitative estimates to systematically address uncertainty within an analysis. This is important when using SRS data in conservation applications because decisions need to be made irrespective of data quality and well characterized uncertainty can be incorporated into decision theoretic approaches.
   Caracterizacion de la Incertidumbre Espacial cuando se Integran Datos Sociales a la Planeacion de la Conservacion Estudios recientes de la planeacion de la conservacion han presentado estrategias para integrar datos sociales con referencia espacial (SRE) con miras a mejorar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Revisamos la creciente literatura de conservacion sobre los datos SRE, enfocandonos en las preferencias obtenidas o mencionadas derivadas de metodos de encuestas sociales como los experimentos de opcion y los sistemas de informacion geografica de participacion publica. Los datos SRE obtenidos incluyeron a la distribucion espacial de la disposicion de vender, de pagar, de actuar y evaluaciones de los valores culturales y sociales. Desarrollamos una tipologia para evaluar la incertidumbre de los datos SRE obtenidos, la que describe como la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales se propaga cuando se proyecta espacialmente y la importancia de responder a la incertidumbre espacial como los efectos de escala y la calidad de datos. Estas incertidumbres se propagaran cuando los datos SRE obtenidos se integren con datos biofisicos para la planeacion de la conservacion y pueden tener consecuencias importantes para evaluar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Para explorar mas a fondo este tema, llevamos a cabo una revision sistematica de la literatura sobre datos SRE obtenidos. Encontramos que la incertidumbre de encuestas sociales se probaba comunmente, pero que estas incertidumbres se ignoraban al proyectarse espacialmente. Con base en estos resultados desarrollamos un marco de trabajo que ayudara a los investigadores y a los practicantes a estimar la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales y a usar estos estimados cuantitativos para senalar sistematicamente a la incertidumbre dentro de un analisis. Estos es importante cuando se usan datos SRE en aplicaciones de la conservacion ya que las decisiones deben tomarse sin importar la calidad de los datos y una incertidumbre bien caracterizada puede ser incorporada a las estrategias de decision teorica.

AB  - Analyses of fur color patterns. morphometric data derived from external, cranial, and dental dimensions, and distributions of collection sites for voucher specimens form the basis for a taxonomic revision of Sulawesi's endemic squirrel fauna Eight species of tree squirrels in Rubrisciurus and Prosciurillus and two species of ground squirrels in Hyosciurus are recognized All are diurnal and inhabit primary forest formations Diet consists of fruit, nuts, seeds, and arthropods Rubrisciurus rubriventer, the lamest in body size, forages on the ground and in the lower canopy layer. is found throughout Sulawesi where primary forest persists. and occurs through an altitudinal range embracing tropical lowland evergreen and lower montane ram forests, It is absent from upper montane rain forest. Five species of arboreal squirrels comprise the Prosciurillus leucomus group, a cluster of species occupying the upper forest canopy. P leucomus, known only from lowland and montane habitats in the northern peninsula and one offshore island, P alstom, recorded from lowland tropical evergreen rain forest in the eastern section of Sulawesi's central core, the east-central and southeastern arms, and two southeastern Islands, P webert, represented by a few specimens from the coastal lowlands of the southern core of Sulawesi. P topapuensts, endemic to the western mountain block in Sulawesi's central core and occurring along an altitudinal gradient from lowland evergreen rain forest to upper montane rain forest. and P rosenbergu, the only species of squirrel collected on islands in the Sangihe Archipelago north of the northeastern tip of the northern peninsula The Proscuirillus murimus group contains two species of small body size P murmur, found throughout Sulawesi and in all forest formations, from the coastal lowlands to mountain tops, and a forager in the lower canopy layers; and P abstrusus, known only from montane forest habitats on Pegunungan Mekongga in the southeastern peninsula Of two species of ground squirrels, Hyosciurus hemrichi occupies montane forest habitats in the western mountain block of Sulawesi's central core. It is altitudinally parapatric to H deile, which inhabits lowland evergreen and lower montane rain forests in the western mountain block and northeastern lowlands of central Sulawesi, and montane forest on the northern peninsula.
   A slightly revised classification of Sciuridae is provided in which a new tribe, Exiliscurus. is proposed for the Bornean and Philippine Exiliscurus Previously published results of morphological and molecular analyses point to Rubrisciurus. Proscurillus, and Hyoscuirus as a monophyletic cluster. the Hyosciurus, nested within a larger chide, the Nannosciurini, which along with Exilisciurinin tribe and Funambulini, comprise the Nannosciurini. one of the three subfamilies constituting Sciuridae, and one that contains most of the Indomalayan genera. The present diversity of species endemic to Sulawesi was derived from an ancient lineage that crossed a sea barrier from the Sunda Shelf to Sulawesi during the late Miocene
   Eight new species of hoplopleurid sucking lice (Insecta. Anoplura) are described as parasitizing 8 of the 10 species of squirrels endemic to Sulawesi Hoplopleura rubrisciuri from Rubriscuirus rubriventer, Hoplopleura leucomus from Proscuirillus leucomus. Hoplopleura alstom from Prosciurillus alstom, Hoplopleura topapuensis from Proscuirillus topapuenisi, Hoplopleura murmus from Proscurillus murmus, Hoplopleura abstrusus from Prosciurillus abstrusus. Hoplopleura hemrichi from Hyosciurus hemrichi, and Hoplopleura thiele from Hyosciurus thiele Examples of Prosciurillus webert and P rosenbergu were surveyed but no lice were recovered. A phylogenetic analysis based on cladistic principles for six species of Sulawesian squirrel lice for which both sexes were available is presented and the results discussed with respect to host relationships These new data are incorporated into a discussion covering zoogeography of global sound-sucking louse associations, emphasizing the Indomalayan squirrel fauna
   Globally, members of 11 genera of Anoplura parasitize smirk's, a figure far exceeding the number of anopluran genera associated with any other mammalian family Nine of these (the enderlemellids, Atopophithurus, Enderlemellus, Microphthirus, Phthirunculus, and Werneckia, the hoplopleurid, Paradoxophthirus; and the polyplacids, Johnsonpthirus, Linognathoides, and Neohaematopmus) are primary parasites of sciurids. The remaining two (the hoplopleurid Hoplopleura, and the polyplacid Polyplax) include representatives that are acquired (secondary) parasites of scrurids-the majority of species in these two louse genera parasitize other groups of mammals but a small number of species have transferred to squirrel hosts Sciurid hosts and geographic distributions of these 11 anopluran genera are discussed Historically, representatives of Hoplopleura colonized different sciurid hosts on several separate occasions with one known species on a North American tree squirrel (Scull-us), two described species on North American flying squirrels (Glancomys), two species parasitizing North American species of chipmunks (Tamas and Eutamas) 14 described species from Indomalayan nannosciurine squiriels (Callosciurus, Tamops. Rubrisciurus, Prosciurillus Hyoscuirus, and Funambulus), and one species parasitizing a Chinese xerine ground squirrel (Senootamas) The zoogeography of the seven sciurid-infesting louse genera known from Southeast Asia is discussed using data from nine different countries or regions (China. Taiwan, Thailand. peninsular Malaysia. Sumatra, Java. Borneo. the Philippines. and Sulawesi) A reduction in the 11 umber of sciurid-infesting anopluran genera and species is apparent from mainland northern/western regions to insular southern/eastern regions with members of seven genera and 23 species described from China but only one genus and eight species from Sulawesi. The absence of known species of Hoplopleura from Bornean and Javanese squirrels suggests that such a fauna may await discovery on one of both of these islands
   Six of the eight species or Hoplopleura found parasitizing species of endemic Sulawesi squirrels were recovered as a monophyletic clade from a phylogenetic analysis employing anatomical structures associated with male and female lice (Two species of Sulawesi Hoplopleura are based on females and nymphs only and were not incorporated into the analysis) The monophyletic cluster formed by the Sulawesian squirrel lice joined with the monophyletic assemblage containing the three Sulawesi squirrel genera-Rubriscuirus. Proscuirillus, and Hyosciurus-suggest that the ancestral squirrel lineage that arrived in Sulawesi during the late Miocene may have been carrying its unique Hoplopleura parasite

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this article is through a systematic literature review (SLR) to present a conceptual approach to the importance of communication for thermalism. An in-depth analysis of scientific publications provides a conceptual understanding about the definition of thermalism and the importance of communication in the thermal sector. The intention is also to identify the major challenges for communication in thermalism in times of crisis. The literature on conceptual approaches in the field of thermalism is almost non-existent, and this is an important contribution of the research presented.
   Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the objectives, an SLR was carried out, through the Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement method, using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 139 articles were found, of which only 26 were used for the qualitative analysis. EndNote 20 and Nvivo software were used to identify the articles for the study, their analysis and systematization of the collected information.
   Findings - The results, among others, through an in-depth analysis of scientific publications, clarified the definition of thermalism and provided relevant results for better understanding of the importance of the dimensions of communication for thermalism.
   Research limitations/implications - The research addresses the current scarcity of academic work on the importance of communication applied to a thermal destination and the lack of relevant strategic models for the diffusion/promotion of a destination. Finally, a limitation was the fact that only 2 databases were considered and only journal articles were included. As a future line of research the authors propose extending the theme to thermal tourism experiences. In addition, scientific studies focusing on water-based experiences connected with thermalism are almost non-existent and very relevant for the future of the sector, as well as studies in the area of communication with the following research questions: where do tourists consult information when choosing a travel destination? and what are the appropriate communication channels to reach the thermal market?; We close this reflection by concluding that the thermal tradition, through the know-how of the medical class, the properties of thermal waters and the cultural history associated with its early days, stimulated more recently by implementing innovations, will regain its role in preserving health and well-being through thermal water and the exploitation of territories' endogenous resources. These factors are the basis through which communication sciences can create strategies adapted to each country to promote a thermal destination brand.
   Practical implications - Research in tourism destination management has provided solutions, through communication, to problems that are faced daily by countries, and the authors hope this research also contributes to the recovery of thermal tourism destinations in times of crisis. It is also from this perspective that based on the main themes and dimensions of communication identified in the SLR that the authors propose the Corporate, Organisational, Skills, Management and Online (COSMO) model to help promote resilient thermal destinations prepared for future crises. The diversity and originality of this research model will be useful for destination promoters, spa managers and communication professionals.
   Social implications - This study contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical framework of excellence in thermalism. One possible way to solve the ambiguity of terms related to thermalism is to consider another more comprehensive term as a combination of different approaches. The aim is not to create an academic division, but rather to contribute to better conceptual understanding, from a theoretical and paradigmatic perspective, of what thermalism is. Here, a new targeted and more comprehensive concept emerges, which from the academic perspective of communication sciences will lead to prevention for a new way of feeling good with life, contributing to promoting thermal destinations in the world with a greater understanding.
   Originality/value - For better understanding of the concepts, this study proposes a new definition of thermalism. As research related to thermal destinations, through communication management contributes to attract tourists, promote experiences, provide the human capital of the sector with skills and create authentic and resilient place brands. It is from this perspective that the model was proposed, based on the dimensions of communication related to the main themes obtained through the SLR. This model supports a plurality of communication strategies, with different characteristics and objectives but which meet a collective purpose: to disseminate information about thermalism, in order to build collective knowledge to promote thermal destinations. The analysis highlights the need for further research into thermalism, with special focus on communication.

AB  - Background
   More than 90% of the global population lives in areas exceeding World Health Organization air quality limits. More than four million people each year are thought to die early due to air pollution, and poor air quality is thought to reduce an average European's life expectancy by one year. Individuals may be able to reduce health risks through interventions such as masks, behavioural changes and use of air quality alerts. To date, evidence is lacking about the efficacy and safety of such interventions for the general population and people with long-term respiratory conditions. This topic, and the review question relating to supporting evidence to avoid or lessen the effects of air pollution, emerged directly from a group of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in South London, UK.
   Objectives
   1. To assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of individual-level interventions that aim to help people with or without chronic respiratory conditions to reduce their exposure to outdoor air pollution.
   2. To assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of individual-level interventions that aim to help people with chronic respiratory conditions reduce the personal impact of outdoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
   Search methods
   We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and other major databases. We did not restrict our searches by date, language or publication type and included a search of the grey literature (e.g. unpublished information). We conducted the most recent search on 16 October 2020.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS) that included a comparison treatment arm, in adults and children that investigated the effectiveness of an individual-level intervention to reduce risks of outdoor air pollution. We included studies in healthy individuals and those in people with long-term respiratory conditions. We excluded studies which focused on non-respiratory long-term conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. We did not restrict eligibility of studies based on outcomes.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) as appropriate. One review author entered data into the review; this was spot-checked by a second author. We planned to meta-analyse results from RCTs and NRS separately, using a random-effects model. This was not possible, so we presented evidence narratively. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were: measures of air pollution exposure; exacerbation of respiratory conditions; hospital admissions; quality of life; and serious adverse events.
   Main results
   We identified 11 studies (3372 participants) meeting our inclusion criteria (10 RCTs and one NRS). Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years, and the duration of studies ranged from 24 hours to 104 weeks. Six cross-over studies recruited healthy adults and five parallel studies included either people with pre-existing conditions (three studies) or only pregnant women (two studies). Interventions included masks (e.g. an N95 mask designed to filter out airborne particles) (five studies), an alternative cycle route (one study), air quality alerts and education (five studies). Studies were set in Australia, China, Iran, the UK, and the USA.
   Due to the diversity of study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes, we did not perform any meta-analyses and instead summarised results narratively. We judged both RCTs and the NRS to be at risk of bias from lack of blinding and lack of clarity regarding selection methods. Many studies did not provide a prepublished protocol or trial registration.
   From five studies (184 participants), we found that masks or altered cycle routes may have little or no impact on physiological markers of air pollution exposure (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate variability), but we are very uncertain about this estimate using the GRADE approach. We found conflicting evidence regarding health care usage from three studies of air pollution alerts, with one non-randomised cross-over trial (35 participants) reporting an increase in emergency hospital attendances and admissions, but the other two randomised parallel trials (1553 participants) reporting little to no difference. We also gave the evidence for this outcome a very uncertain GRADE rating. None of our included trials reported respiratory exacerbations, quality of life or serious adverse events.
   Secondary outcomes were not well reported, but indicated inconsistent impacts of air quality alerts and education interventions on adherence, with some trials reporting improvements in the intervention groups and others reporting little or no difference. Symptoms were reported by three trials, with one randomised cross-over trial (15 participants) reporting a small increase in breathing difficulties associated with the mask intervention, one non-randomised cross-over trial (35 participants) reporting reduced throat and nasal irritation in the lower-pollution cycle route group (but no clear difference in other respiratory symptoms), and another randomised parallel trial (519 participants) reporting no clear difference in symptoms between those who received a smog warning and those who did not.
   Authors' conclusions
   The lack of evidence and study diversity has limited the conclusions of this review. Using a mask or a lower-pollution cycle route may mitigate some of the physiological impacts from air pollution, but evidence was very uncertain. We found conflicting results for other outcomes, including health care usage, symptoms and adherence/behaviour change. We did not find evidence for adverse events.
   Funders should consider commissioning larger, longer studies, using high-quality and well-described methods, recruiting participants with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Studies should report outcomes of importance to people with respiratory conditions, such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, quality of life and adverse events.

AB  - Introduction: Homelessness among women is on the rise in the US and continues to be a concern globally. The challenges homeless women face are unique and vast, yet how they experience health care can greatly affect their desire to access health care in the future. The ability to shed light on what is meaningful to homeless women in their health care experiences can guide the changes necessary to provide appropriate patient-centered, impactful care with the goal of increasing access by this vulnerable population.
   Objective: This review aimed to identify, appraise and synthesize existing qualitative evidence on the experiences of homeless women when accessing community-based health care services.
   Inclusion criteria: This review included studies on homeless women, both previously or currently, aged 18 or older. The phenomena of interest were homeless women's health care experiences, including perspectives, narratives and/or reflections, at any time during their period of homelessness. The review included health care services received by homeless women in community-based settings, shelter-based clinics and/or mobile clinics. Qualitative data including, but not limited to, the designs of phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, qualitative description, action research and feminist research were considered.
   Methods: Using a three-step search strategy, databases of published and unpublished articles were searched from database inception to 2018. All included studies were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality, and data was extracted and pooled using the JBI System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information. Findings were rated according to their level of credibility, categorized based on similarity in meaning, and subjected to a meta-synthesis. Two reviewers utilized a meta-aggregative approach.
   Results: A total of 196 qualitative articles were identified of which 24 were included after critical appraisal. Meta-synthesis generated three synthesized findings: (1) Homeless women who access health care services at community-based settings feel as if their homelessness qualifies them as second-class citizens, which impedes future access; (2) Homeless women have an expectation of therapeutic communication from their health care providers, the lack of which can incite negative emotional responses, fear and knowledge deficits; (3) Homeless women with limited resources struggle to prioritize competing needs, such as transportation, time and money, which influences their ability to access health care. These synthesized findings were derived from 47 study findings that were subsequently aggregated into 10 categories. Of the 47 study findings, 32 were rated as unequivocal and 15 were rated as credible. The overall ConQual for each of the three synthesized findings was low due to common dependability issues across the included studies. A total of 454 participants were included. The included studies were published from 1997 to 2017.
   Conclusion: The review identified that homeless women's experiences when accessing health care in community-based settings, particularly in the US, have been poor and have negatively affected their desire to access health care in the future. The synthesized findings illustrate clear indicators for use of cultural competence and addressing provider bias in the delivery of health care to homeless women. This review also highlights the importance of understanding clinical experiences of providing direct care for these women in order to shed light on the type of advocacy needed to ensure equitable access to health care services. While this review uncovered issues with some global health care systems, the predominance of system constraints within the US highlights the need for health policy reform to improve the experiences of homeless women when accessing health care.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that the reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides and mineral fertilizers in agriculture has significant negative environmental and/or health impacts and poses a risk for future food security. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses showed that organic production systems, which omit the use of agrochemicals, produce crops with lower yields, but superior nutritional composition. However, the agronomic parameters responsible for differences in crop yields and nutritional quality are poorly understood. Methods: Here we report results for four field vegetable crops from the Nafferton Factorial Systems Comparison (NFSC) trial. This long-term factorial field experiment was designed to (i) identify effects of growing season/climatic variation, and contrasting rotational designs, crop protection protocols and fertilization regimes used in organic and conventional systems on crop health, yield and nutritional parameters and (ii) estimate the relative importance of climatic and agronomic drivers for crop health, yield and nutritionally relevant quality parameters. Quality parameters monitored in harvested products, included phenolic, glucosinolate, vitamin C, vitamin B9, carotenoid, cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and glycoalkaloid concentrations. Results: Climatic conditions during the growing season were found to have a larger impact on crop yield and quality than the agronomic factors (pre-crop, crop protection, fertilization) studied. However, the (i) interactions between growing season with contrasting climatic conditions and agronomic factors identified by ANOVA for crop health, yield and quality parameters and (ii) the associations between the three climatic drivers (precipitation, temperature, radiation) and crop yield and quality parameters differed substantially between the four crop plant species. Among the agronomic factors, fertilization had a substantially larger impact compared with both pre-crop and crop protection. Specifically, crop yields were found to be significantly increased by the use of (i) conventional fertilization and crop protection methods in potato, (ii) conventional fertilization, but organic crop protection methods in cabbage, and (iii) conventional fertilization regimes in lettuce, while none of the agronomic factors had a significant effect on onion yields. When important crop pest and diseases were assessed, (i) conventional crop protection resulted in significantly lower late blight severity in potato, while (ii) organic crop protection resulted in lower bird damage and cabbage root fly (CRF) incidence in cabbages, and Sclerotinia incidence in lettuce and (iii) organic fertilization resulted in lower CRF and Sclerotinia incidence in cabbage and lettuce respectively. When concentrations of nutritionally relevant phytochemicals were compared, organic fertilization resulted in significantly higher phenolic concentrations in potato, cabbage and lettuce, higher glucosinolate and carotenoid concentrations in cabbage, higher vitamin C concentrations in potato and cabbage and higher vitamin B9 concentrations in potato and lettuce-but lower concentrations of toxic glycoalkaloids in potato. Significant effects of crop protection protocols on phytochemical concentrations were only detected in cabbage with conventional crop protection resulting in higher glucosinolate and vitamin B9 concentrations.
   When toxic metal concentrations were compared, organic fertilization resulted in significantly lower Cd concentrations in all four crops and lower Ni concentrations in potato, cabbage and onion. Significant effects of crop protection were only detected in cabbage, where organic crop protection resulted in lower Ni concentrations. Pb concentrations were not affected by any of the agronomic factors. The potential implications of results for improving (i) strategies to reduce the use of non-renewable resources and environmental impacts of vegetable production and (ii) the productivity of organic and other low-input vegetable production systems without compromising food quality are discussed. Conclusions: The study confirms that organic vegetable production protocols result in higher concentrations of phenolics and other nutritionally desirable phytochemicals, but lower concentrations of the toxic metals Cd and Ni in harvested products. It also demonstrates, for the first time, that this is primarily due to differences in fertilization regimes. The finding that in three of the four crops (cabbage, lettuce and onion) the application of synthetic chemical crop protection products had no measurable positive impact on crop health and yield should be considered in the context of the growing concern about health impacts of pesticide use in field vegetable crops.

AB  - With the increasing depletion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) and the urgent need to achieve the goals of "carbon peak" and "carbon neutral", the development of clean and sustainable energy sources (such as solar, wind, hydrogen energy and so on) as a potential alternative to the fossil fuels is imperative. However, the clean energies are volatile and intermittent and require energy storage technologies to regulate supply and demand before they can be used in real life and practical production. Lithium ion batteries, with their high energy density, long cycling lifetime, and no memory effect, are considered as a key technology for energy conversion and storage. In recent decades, lithium ion batteries have been widely used in portable electric devices, electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage. Although the energy and power densities have been continuously improved, and application scenarios are expanding, the safety issues of lithium ion batteries are becoming increasingly prominent and seriously threaten the development of lithium ion batteries. Once lithium ion batteries operate outside their preset operating windows (e.g., temperature, voltage, current density, etc.), it can reduce the discharge capacity, shorten cycling lifetime and cause thermal runaway, resulting in fire, combustion and even explosion hazards. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to understand the intrinsic failure mechanism and external characteristics, and to prevent safety accidents caused by the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, so that we can eventually produce safer lithium ion batteries with higher energy density.
   Currently, the main strategies to protect lithium ion batteries from the thermal runaway and improve the safety of lithium ion batteries are as follows: (1) Designing the thermal management system to ensure lithium ion batteries work stably within an appropriate operating window. For example, designing liquid cooling, gas cooling or phase transition (liquid gas) cooling system in the thermal management system to enable the battery to operate within the ideal temperature range (20 +/- 5 to 60 +/- 5 degrees C). (2) Improving key materials and structures of lithium ion batteries to enhance the stability and reduce the risk of the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, such as addition of electrolyte additives, design and optimization of functional separators and their preparation process, structural engineering of cathode, anode and solid electrolyte materials. (3) Based on the changes in current, voltage, resistance, pressure, and gas generation phenomena during the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries, developing real-time monitoring system to provide early warning and intervention. (4) From the perspective of heat release and combustion caused by the thermal runaway, developing efficient flame retardant or fire-extinguishing agents for the fire protection systems. Among them, early monitoring and warning for the thermal runaway is an effective means to improve the reliability and safety of lithium ion batteries.
   This article presents a systematic review of the causes, processes and methods of prediction and early warning of the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries. Firstly, the most common abuse behaviors and corresponding mechanisms related to the thermal runaway of lithium ion batteries are summarized. Secondly, the main stages of the thermal runaway process of lithium ion batteries, including the early reaction stage, the bulging stage and the fire/explosion stage, are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the signals in the above three stages, including voltage, resistance, temperature, pressure, gas, sound, smoke, fire, etc., and the early-warning technologies based on them are discussed in detail. Finally, prospective for future thermal runaway early-warning technologies of lithium ion batteries with high accuracy and wide application range is proposed. This review aims to achieve a broader and deeper understanding both in intrinsic mechanisms and external characteristics of the thermal runaway behaviors, and provide guidance on the development of highly effective earlywarning technologies of lithium ion batteries.

AB  - BackgroundTaenia solium (T. solium), is a zoonotic helminth causing three diseases namely; taeniasis (in humans), neurocysticercosis (NCC, in humans) and porcine cysticercosis (PCC, in pigs) and is one of the major foodborne diseases by burden. The success or failure of control options against this parasite in terms of reduced prevalence or incidence of the diseases may be attributed to the contextual factors which underpin the design, implementation, and evaluation of control programmes.
   Methodology/Principal findings The study used a mixed method approach combining systematic literature review (SLR) and key informant interviews (KII). The SLR focused on studies which implemented T. solium control programmes and was used to identify the contextual factors and enabling environment relevant to successful inception, planning and implementation of the interventions. The SLR used a protocol pre-registered at the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) number CRD42019138107 and followed PRISMA guidelines on reporting of SLR. To further highlight the importance and interlinkage of these contextual factors, KII were conducted with researchers/implementers of the studies included in the SLR. The SLR identified 41 publications that had considerations of the contextual factors. They were grouped into efficacy (10), effectiveness (28) and scale up or implementation (3) research studies. The identified contextual factors included epidemiological, socioeconomic, cultural, geographical and environmental, service and organizational, historical and financial factors. The enabling environment was mainly defined by policy and strategies supporting T. solium control.
   Conclusion/Significance Failure to consider the contextual factors operating in target study sites was shown to later present challenges in project implementation and evaluation that negatively affected expected outcomes. This study highlights the importance of fully considering the various domains of the context and integrating these explicitly into the plan for implementation and evaluation of control programmes. Explicit reporting of these aspects in the resultant publication is also important to guide future work. The contextual factors highlighted in this study may be useful to guide future research and scale up of disease control programmes and demonstrates the importance of close multi-sectoral collaboration in a One Health approach.
   Author summaryTaenia solium, commonly known as the pork tapeworm is a parasite that, as the etiological agent of neurocysticercosis (the presence of the intermediate state/cysts of the parasite in the central nervous system of humans) is one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy across endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Southern America and south-east Asia. A variety of biologically efficacious control options exist which include; deworming, provision of clean water and sanitation and appropriate hygiene and food safety education in humans and the vaccination, deworming, confinement and proper feeding of pigs. Despite these, the parasite has not been eliminated and varying impact of interventions has been achieved in the many endemic areas. Failure of the interventions to achieve expected impact could be attributed either to inadequate consideration of various contextual factors, or inability to create an enabling environment needed to underpin success. Contextual factors in this instance are features of the circumstances for which an intervention is conceived and developed and in which it is implemented and evaluated. We conducted a systematic literature review coupled with key informant interviews to identify these contextual factors and show how they may have influenced the implementation and evaluation of control programmes. The study identified that choice of baseline and end line measures, local knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the target population, existing infrastructural and staff capacities, stakeholder participation and support by the national governments through policies and strategies may affect the implementation and evaluation of control interventions. During project inception, there is need to document and understand these contextual factors in order to anticipate the challenges and adapt accordingly.

AB  - Background: As populations become increasingly urbanised, the preservation of urban green space (UGS) becomes paramount. UGS is not just dedicated recreational space such as public parks, but other types of informal green space are important, for example, street trees and roof gardens. Despite the potential from cross-sectional evidence, we know little about how to design new, or improve or promote existing UGS for health, wellbeing, social and environmental benefits, or known influencing factors such as physical activity.
   Objectives: To perform a meta-narrative review of the evidence regarding the health, wellbeing, social, environmental and equity effects, or known influencing factors of these outcomes, of UGS interventions.
   Data sources: Eight electronic databases were searched ((Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Indices), PADDI (Planning Architecture Design Database Ireland), Zetoc, Scopus, Greenfiles, SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe)), and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were hand searched for further relevant studies.
   Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: Eligibility criteria included: (i) evaluation of an UGS intervention; and (ii) health, wellbeing, social or environmental outcome(s), or known influencing factors of these outcomes, measured. Interventions involving any age group were included. Interventions must have involved: (a) physical change to green space in an urban-context including improvements to existing UGS or development of new UGS, or (b) combination of physical change to UGS supplemented by a specific UGS awareness, marketing or promotion programme to encourage use of UGS.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Following a meta-narrative approach, evidence was synthesised by main intervention approach, including: (i) park-based; (ii) greenways/trails; (iii) urban greening; (iv) large green built projects for environmental purposes. Outcomes such as economic (e.g. cost effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses), adverse effects and unintended consequences were also extracted. Evidence was synthesised following the RAMESES guidelines and publication standards, the PROGRESS-plus tool was used to explore equity impact, and risk of bias/study quality was assessed. The findings from the evidence review were presented at an expert panel representing various disciplines in a workshop and these discussions framed the findings of the review and provide recommendations that are relevant to policy, practice and research.
   Results: Of the 6997 studies identified, 38 were included. There was strong evidence to support park-based (7/7 studies) and greenway/trail (3/3 studies) interventions employing a dual-approach (i.e. a physical change to the UGS and promotion/marketing programmes) particularly for park use and physical activity; strong evidence for the greening of vacant lots (4/4 studies) for health, wellbeing (e.g. reduction in stress) and social (e.g. reduction in crime, increased perceptions of safety) outcomes; strong evidence for the provision of urban street trees (3/4 studies) and green built interventions for storm water management (6/7 studies) for environmental outcomes (e.g. increased biodiversity, reduction in illegal dumping). Park-based or greenway/trail interventions that did not employ a dual-approach were largely ineffective (7/12 studies showed no significant intervention effect). Overall, the included studies have inherent biases owing to the largely non-randomized study designs employed. There was too little evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of UGS interventions on a range of equity indicators.
   Limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings: UGS has an important role to play in creating a culture of health and wellbeing. Results from this study provide supportive evidence regarding the use of certain UGS interventions for health, social and environmental benefits. These findings should be interpreted in light of the heterogeneous nature of the evidence base, including diverging methods, target populations, settings and outcomes. We could draw little conclusions regarding the equity impact of UGS interventions. However, the true potential of UGS has not been realised as studies have typically under-evaluated UGS interventions by not taking account of the multifunctional nature of UGS. The findings have implications for policymakers, practitioners and researchers. For example, for policymakers the trajectory of evidence is generally towards a positive association between UGS and health, wellbeing, social and environmental outcomes, but any intervention must ensure that negative consequences of gentrification and unequal access are minimised.

AB  - Background
   The prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence is high. Excessive body fat at a young age is likely to persist into adulthood and is associated with physical and psychosocial co-morbidities, as well as lower cognitive, school and later life achievement. Lifestyle changes, including reduced caloric intake, decreased sedentary behaviour and increased physical activity, are recommended for prevention and treatment of child and adolescent obesity. Evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children of normal weight. Similar beneficial effects may be seen in overweight or obese children and adolescents.
   Objectives
   To assess whether lifestyle interventions (in the areas of diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and behavioural therapy) improve school achievement, cognitive function and future success in overweight or obese children and adolescents compared with standard care, waiting list control, no treatment or attention control.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases in May 2013: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, ERIC, IBSS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, SPORTDiscus, Database on Obesity and Sedentary Behaviour Studies, Database of Promoting Health Effectiveness Reviews (DoPHER) and Database of Health Promotion Research. In addition, we searched the Network Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), three trials registries and reference lists. We also contacted researchers in the field.
   Selection criteria
   We included (cluster) randomised and controlled clinical trials of lifestyle interventions for weight management in overweight or obese children three to 18 years of age. Studies in children with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function were excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed quality and risk of bias and cross-checked extracts to resolve discrepancies when required. Authors were contacted to obtain further study details and were asked to provide data on the overweight and obese study population when they were not reported separately.
   Main results
   Of 529 screened full-text articles, we included in the reviewsix studies (14 articles) of 674 overweight and obese children and adolescents, comprising four studies with multicomponent lifestyle interventions and two studies with physical activity only interventions. We conducted a meta-analysis when possible and a sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of cluster-randomised controlled trials and/or studies at 'high risk' of attrition bias on the intervention effect. We prioritised reporting of the sensitivity analysis when risk of bias and differences in intervention type and duration were suspected to have influenced the findings substantially. Analysis of a single study indicated that school-based healthy lifestyle education combined with nutrition interventions can produce small improvements in overall school achievement (mean difference (MD) 1.78 points on a scale of zero to 100, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.76; P < 0.001; N = 321; moderate-quality evidence). Single component physical activity interventions produced small improvements in mathematics achievement (MD 3.00 points on a scale of zero to 200, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.22; P value = 0.008; one RCT; N = 96; high-quality evidence), executive function (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, standard deviation (SD) 15, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.91; P value = 0.04; one RCT; N = 116) and working memory (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, SD 15, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.49; P value = 0.02; one RCT; N = 116). No evidence suggested an effect of any lifestyle intervention on reading, vocabulary and language achievements, attention, inhibitory control and simultaneous processing. Pooling of data in meta-analyses was restricted by variations in study design. Heterogeneity was present within some meta-analyses and may have been explained by differences in types of interventions. Risk of bias was low for most assessed items; however in half of the studies, risk of bias was detected for attrition, participant selection and blinding. No study provided evidence of the effect of lifestyle interventions on future success. Whether changes in academic and cognitive abilities were connected to changes in body weight status was unclear because of conflicting findings and variations in study design.
   Authors' conclusions
   Despite the large number of childhood obesity treatment trials, evidence regarding their impact on school achievement and cognitive abilities is lacking. Existing studies have a range of methodological issues affecting the quality of evidence. Multicomponent interventions targeting physical activity and healthy diet could benefit general school achievement, whereas a physical activity intervention delivered for childhood weight management could benefit mathematics achievement, executive function and working memory. Although the effects are small, a very large number of children and adolescents could benefit from these interventions. Therefore health policy makers may wish to consider these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment trials are needed to examine overweight or obese children and adolescents and to report academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of duplex ultrasound (DUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA), as alternatives to contrast angiography (CA), for the assessment of lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
   Data sources: Ten electronic databases were searched in April 2004, with an update in May 2005. Six key journals and bibliographies of included studies were also searched and experts in the field were consulted.
   Review methods: Data extraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. Data were analysed according to test type and diagnostic threshold. For the economic analysis, a decision tree was developed and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed to incorporate statistical uncertainty into the cost-effectiveness analysis.
   Results: A total of 113 studies met the inclusion criteria (including six economic evaluations). For the detection of stenosis greater than 50% in the whole leg, contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA (14 studies) had the highest diagnostic accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 92 to 99.5% and specificity from 64 to 99%. Two-dimensional (2D) time-of-flight (TOF) MRA (11 studies) was less accurate, with sensitivity ranging from 79 to 94% and specificity from 74 to 92%. 2D phase-contrast (PC) MRA (one study) had a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 74%. CTA (seven studies) also appeared slightly inferior to CE MRA, with a sensitivity ranging from 89 to 99% and specificity from 83 to 97%, but better than DUS (28 studies), which had a sensitivity ranging from 80 to 98% and specificity from 89 to 99%. There was some indication that CE MRA and DUS were more accurate for detecting stenoses/occlusions above the knee than below the knee or in the pedal artery. The four studies of patient attitudes strongly suggested that patients preferred CE MRA to CA. CA was considered the most uncomfortable test, followed by CE MRA, with CTA being the least uncomfortable. Half of the patients (from a sample who did not suffer from claustrophobia and had no metallic implants) expressed no preference between undergoing TOF MRA or DUS; most of those who did express a preference favoured TOF MRA. In the 55 studies identified for adverse events, MRA was associated with the highest reported proportion. However, the most severe adverse events were more common in patients undergoing CA; although these were rare for both tests. The economic evaluation showed DUS dominated the other alternatives when the whole leg was assessed, by presenting higher effectiveness at a lower cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY; i.e. 13,646 pound per QALY). When the assessment was limited to a section of the leg, either above the knee or below the knee, 2D TOF MRA was the most cost-effective preoperative diagnostic strategy. The incremental cost per QALY for below-the-knee comparisons was equal to 37,024 pound when 2D TOF MRA was compared with DUS. For above-the-knee comparisons, 2D TOF MRA presented the lowest cost and slightly lower effectiveness compared with CE MRA, with a cost per QALY equal to 13,442 pound.
   Conclusions: The results of the review suggest that CE MRA has a better overall diagnostic accuracy than CTA or DUS, and that CE MRA is generally preferred by patients over CA. Where available, CE MRA may be a viable alternative to CA. The only controlled trial suggested that the results of DUS were comparable to those of CA, in terms of surgical planning and outcome. This finding conflicts with the results of diagnostic accuracy studies, which reported poor estimates of accuracy for DUS in comparison with CA. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate the usefulness of CTA for the assessment of PAD, particularly newer techniques. The results of the economic modelling suggest that for PAD patients for whom the whole leg is evaluated by a preoperative diagnostic test, DUS dominates the other alternatives by presenting higher effectiveness at a lower cost per QALY. However, when the analysis of stenosis is limited to a section of the leg, either above the knee or below the knee, 2D TOF MRA appears to be the most cost-effective preoperative diagnostic strategy. Further research is needed into a number of areas including the relative clinical effectiveness of the available imaging tests, in terms of surgical planning and postoperative outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and young children, accounting for approximately 75,000-125,000 hospitalizations per year. It is estimated that in 2000, RSV infection accounted for 1.7 million office visits, 402,000 emergency room visits, and 236,000 hospital outpatient visits per year for children younger than 5 years of age. Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against RSV, is the only immunoprophylaxis therapy approved by the FDA for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants (up to 2 years of age) who meet 1 or more of the following criteria for high risk: (a) gestational age up to 35 weeks; (b) diagnosis of chronic lung disease (CLD, formerly bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]); or (c) diagnosis of cyanotic or complex congenital heart disease. The RSV season typically occurs between November and March but may vary by region. During the period of our review, depending on local duration of the RSV season, infants usually required 5 monthly (every 28-30 days) intramuscular injections of palivizumab. Infants born in the middle of the season received their palivizumab doses from the time of birth to the end of the season and, therefore, may have required less than 5 doses. It is unclear if compliance with monthly doses is a problem and whether noncompliance increases the risk of RSV hospitalizations in routine clinical practice.
   OBJECTIVES: To (a) identify and describe compliance rates and the factors that influence parental compliance with immunoprophylaxis regimens, (b) review intervention programs and describe those that have been associated with increased compliance, and (c) summarize the association of compliance with RSV hospitalization rates.
   METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted using journal databases, including Ovid, Current Contents, Embase, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science; and an abstract database, Medical Intelligence Solution, for citations through April 2008. Specific search terms used were palivizumab with patient compliance, patient adherence, or patient persistence.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five articles and abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Available studies were mostly retrospective or observational prospective. Compliance, defined in various ways across the studies, varied between 25% and 100%, and 12 studies identified some of the factors related to noncompliance. Compliance generally was lower among Medicaid patients, African American patients, and other minorities. Ten studies (3 manuscripts and 7 abstracts) investigated the association of administration of prophylaxis through monthly home visits by a health professional with parental compliance with therapy. Most of the home-based programs were associated with higher compliance rates compared with clinic or office programs. Rates as high as 94% and 64% were achieved when Medicaid infants and infants of minority descent, respectively, received their doses through a home health program. When these infants received their doses at a clinic or office, depending on the definition of compliance, rates were 61%-100% for Medicaid infants and 44% for infants of minority descent. Reminder telephone calls to parents or caregivers, comprehensive multidisciplinary programs that included extensive counseling of parents, calendars with sticker reminders, and education in the language native to parents also were associated with increased compliance, although statistical significance was reported in only 1 study. Several studies recommended educating parents on the benefits of RSV prophylaxis, alleviating transportation and language difficulties, recognizing cultural differences and biases, and clarifying misperception of RSV illness severity. Home health programs had lower rates of RSV hospitalizations than office-based programs in 3 analyses conducted in 2 studies. In 4 other abstracts, the rates of RSV hospitalization for home health programs and office-based administration did not significantly differ. In a large, 4-season, prospective outcome study, compliant infants had lower RSV hospitalization rates than those who were not compliant under one definition of compliance (doses within 35-day intervals). RSV hospitalization rates were not significantly different using another definition of compliance (receipt of anticipated doses, expected vs. observed rates). In a large survey of 10,390 infants identified from pharmacy dispensing records, RSV hospitalization rates were 1.4% in the compliant group versus 3.1% in the noncompliant group (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.4-3.5, P<0.001). Adjustment for confounding was not reported in these studies.
   CONCLUSION: Medicaid and minority infants were less likely to receive scheduled palivizumab doses. Home-based programs for the administration of palivizumab have been investigated more than other interventions and are associated with improved compliance compared with office-based administration. Compliance with dosing, in general, was associated with lower RSV hospitalization rates. However, these strategies should be further investigated using well-designed studies.

AB  - Background
   Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains suboptimal. In order to influence non-adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost-effective behaviour-change interventions.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects.
   Search methods
   We searchedCENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science onWeb of Science on 7November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed.
   Main results
   We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow-up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta-analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (ean Difference (D) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self-reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an eventmonitoring systemfor a number ofmedications with adherence levels ranging from84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non-adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non-adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised).
   Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention.
   Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non-adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics.
   The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came fromhigh-income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle-income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle-income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding.
   Authors' conclusions
   While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message-based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high-quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low-and middle-income countries.

AB  - Objective: To provide health care providers with the best evidence on cannabis use with respect to women's health. Areas of focus include general patterns of cannabis use as well as safety of use; care for women who use cannabis; stigma; screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment; impact on hormonal regulation; reproductive health, including contraception and fertility; sexual function; effects on perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms; and use in chronic pelvic pain syndromes.
   Target Population: The target population includes all women currently using or contemplating using cannabis.
   Outcomes: Open, evidence-informed dialogue about cannabis use, which will lead to improvement in patient care.
   Benefits, Harms, and Costs: Exploring cannabis use through a trauma-informed approach provides the health care provider and patient with an opportunity to build a strong, collaborative, therapeutic alliance. This alliance empowers women to make informed choices about their own care. It also allows for the diagnosis and possible treatment of cannabis use disorders. Use should not be stigmatized, as stigma leads to poor "partnered care" (i.e., the partnership between the patient and care provider). Multiple side effects of cannabis use may be mistaken for other disorders. Currently, use of cannabis to treat women's health issues is not covered by public funding; as a result, individual users must pay the direct cost. The indirect costs of cannabis use are unknown. Thus, health care providers and patients must understand the role of cannabis in women's health issues, so that women can make knowledgeable decisions.
   Evidence: PubMed, EMBASE, and grey literature were searched to identify studies of "cannabis use and effect on infertility, contraception, perimenopause and menopausal symptoms, and pelvic pain" published between January 1, 2018 and February 18, 2021. All clinical trials, observational studies, reviews (including systematic reviews and meta-analyses), guidelines, and conference consensus statements were included. Publications were screened for relevance. The search terms were developed using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords (and variants), including cannabis, cannabinoids, marijuana, dexanabinol, dronabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol; the specific terms to capture women's health were estrogen, estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, vaginal contraception, oral contraceptives, fertilization, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and menopause.
   Validation Methods: The authors rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. See online Appendix A (Tables A1 for definitions and A2 for interpretations of strong and weak recommendations).
   Intended Audience: All heath care providers who care for women.
   SUMMARY STATEMENTS:
   1. Cannabis use is increasing, and women are commonly using cannabis for recreational and medical reasons (high).
   2. Use of cannabis, especially products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, can induce or worsen psychosis and worsen depression (high).
   3. Study results concerning the association between cannabis and anxiety are conflicting, and this association requires further evaluation (high).
   4. Use of cannabis, similar to use of other intoxicating substances, may be associated with high-risk sexual activity (low).
   5. There is no evidence that contraceptive methods are altered by cannabis use (low).
   6. There is limited evidence that frequent cannabis use may affect female fertility (moderate), but frequent use can diminish male fertility (moderate).
   7. There is no evidence for cannabis use for management of perimenopausal symptoms (very low).
   8. There is no evidence that cannabis products improve chronic pelvic pain (low).
   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Women should be screened for cannabis use, as they are for other substance use (strong, moderate), and further exploration of its impact should be initiated (strong, moderate).
   2. Cannabis use can be screened for using appropriate screening tools (conditional, moderate)
   3. A trauma-informed care approach and harm reduction should be used when inquiring about cannabis use (strong, low).
   4. The fact that a woman uses cannabis should not influence her choice of contraceptive method (strong, moderate).
   5. Couples should be counselled that cannabis use appears to affect male fertility and may have an impact on female fertility (conditional, moderate).
   6. Sleep disturbances in the perimenopausal period should be characterized and other management modalities trialed before women consider using any cannabis product for this indication (strong, moderate).
   7. Women should be counselled about the lack of evidence for using cannabis products to treat chronic pelvic pain (strong, moderate).

AB  - Background: Due to the increasing complexity of medical education and practice, the preparation of healthcare professionals for leadership roles and responsibilities has become increasingly important. To date, the literature on faculty development designed to promote leadership in medical education has not been reviewed in a systematic fashion.
   Aim: The objective of this review is to synthesize the existing evidence that addresses the following question: 'What are the effects of faculty development interventions designed to improve leadership abilities on the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of faculty members in medicine and on the institutions in which they work?'
   Methods: Search strategy: The search, which covered the period 1980-2009, included six databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, ERIC, and ABI/Inform) and used the following keywords: faculty development; in-service training; doctor; medic; physician; faculty; leadership; management; administration; executive; and change agent. Hand searches were also conducted, and expert recommendations were solicited. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Articles with a focus on faculty development to improve leadership, targeting basic science and clinical faculty members, were reviewed. All study designs that included outcome data beyond participant satisfaction were examined. From an initial 687 unique records, 48 articles met the review criteria in three broad categories: (1) reports in which leadership was the primary focus of the intervention; (2) reports in which leadership was a component of a broader focus on educational development; and (3) reports in which leadership was a component of a broader focus on academic career development. Data extraction: Data were extracted by three coders using the standardized Best Evidence Medical Education coding sheet adapted for our use. One reviewer coded all of the articles, and two reviewers each coded half of the dataset. Coding differences were resolved through discussion. Data synthesis: Data were synthesized using Kirkpatrick's four levels of educational outcomes. Findings were grouped by intervention type and level of outcome.
   Results: Forty-eight articles described 41 studies of 35 different interventions. The majority of the interventions targeted clinical faculty members and included workshops, short courses, fellowships, and other longitudinal programs. The majority of studies were quantitative in nature, though five studies used a qualitative design, and 12 studies used mixed methods. All quantitative studies were quasi-experimental and most employed a single group design; only two studies had a comparison group. Qualitative study designs were typically not specified. The majority of evaluation data, primarily collected post-intervention, consisted of participants' responses to questionnaires and interviews.
   Key points and summary of outcomes:
   Despite methodological limitations, the faculty development literature tends to support the following outcomes:
   High satisfaction with faculty development programs. Participants consistently found programs to be useful and of both personal and professional benefit. They also valued the practical relevance and applicability of the instructional methods used.
   A change in attitudes toward organizational contexts and leadership roles. Participants reported positive changes in attitudes toward their own organizations as well as their leadership capabilities. Some reported an increased awareness of - and commitment to - their institution's vision and challenges, whereas others reported greater self-awareness of personal strengths and limitations, increased motivation, and confidence in their leadership roles. A greater sense of community and appreciation of the benefits of networking were also identified.
   Gains in knowledge and skills. Participants reported increased knowledge of leadership concepts, principles, and strategies (e.g., leadership styles and strategic planning), gains in specific leadership skills (e.g., personal effectiveness and conflict resolution), and increased awareness of leadership roles in academic settings.
   Changes in leadership behavior. Self-perceived changes in leadership behavior were consistently reported and included a change in leadership styles, the application of new skills to the workplace (e.g., departmental reorganization and team building), the adoption of new leadership roles and responsibilities, and the creation of new collaborations and networks. Observed changes primarily suggested new leadership positions.
   Limited changes in organizational practice. Although not frequently examined, changes in organizational practice included the implementation of specific educational innovations, an increased emphasis on educational scholarship, and the establishment of collegial networks.
   Key features of faculty development. Features contributing to positive outcomes included the use of: multiple instructional methods within single interventions; experiential learning and reflective practice; individual and group projects; peer support and the development of communities of practice; mentorship; and institutional support.
   Avenues for future development: Moving forward, faculty development programs should: ground their work in a theoretical framework; articulate their definition of leadership; consider the role of context; explore the value of extended programs and follow-up sessions; and promote the use of alternative practices including narrative approaches, peer coaching, and team development.
   Methodological issues: More rigorous and diverse research designs are needed to capture the complexity of interventions in this area. Varied methods of assessment, utilizing multiple data sources to tap changes at the interpersonal and organizational level should be explored, as should the maintenance of change over time. Process-oriented studies, comparing different faculty development strategies and clarifying the process of change through faculty development, should also become a priority.
   Conclusion: Participants value leadership development activities and report changes in attitudes, knowledge, skills and behavior. Moreover, despite methodological limitations, certain program characteristics seem to be associated with positive outcomes. Further research is required to explore these associations and document changes at both the individual and organizational level.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to set up a systematic review of the development of the concept of carrying capacity, to elucidate the methodological point of view in terms of the definition and evaluation of carrying capacity, and to determine the relation between tourism carrying capacity concept and spatial planning. A tourism carrying capacity thesis is also presented as an active method for planning, control and evaluation of tourism activity.
   Tourism provides opportunities for local and regional development. This development, unless it is clearly directed and controlled, has a tendency to produce negative effects which can manifest as environmental overload, negative impacts on natural and cultural resources, changes in social and economic structures, construction area congestion, changes in tourist destinations characteristics and reducing the quality of life and the functioning of the place. These negative effects strongly influence the degradation of tourist attractions, the decline of the quality of tourism supply and demand, and the reduction in the level of tourism activity. In order to survive, the tourist destinations must be globally competitive, but also locally distinctive and recognizable. Special features of attraction and spatial recognition characteristics of tourist destinations are the benefits underlying the tourism supply and demand. From the spatial planning point of view, in order to be able to sustain long-term quality level of tourism growth that provides economic gain and does not create a negative impact on the tourism area, there must be an implementation of the new adaptive planning tool, which can control tourism activities and growth.
   One of the proposed tools is the concept of tourism carrying capacity, which determines how much tourism activity is acceptable, and determines the limits of tourism activities. Tourism carrying capacity as an adaptive planning concept, which is based on the development of a number of different scenarios, is considered one of the key starting points for sustainable tourism development. For a better comprehension of tourism carrying capacity, as one of the most potent carrying capacity concepts for adaptation into spatial planning, the whole genealogy of carrying capacity is researched. It is primarily developed as a numeric quantitative concept, which has adopted to the numerous transformations to different professional and scientific areas and has become qualitative analytical procedure for governing economic and environmental development sustainability. As such it becomes applicable in tourism planning purposes within the branches of spatial planning. One of the biggest current challenges is to transform and adapt the concept of tourism carrying capacity in a practical and effective tool of spatial planning for sustainable use of tourist space. To achieve this, in this research a systematic and integrated comparative analysis of different thematic approaches of the concept of carrying capacity is set. As a result the guidelines and criteria for the design and setup of the concept of capacity in the framework of spatial planning is determined.
   The following is set: with respect to the thematic focuses of different component the carrying capacity concept is impossible to observe only through the perspective of one of the profession and it is necessary multidisciplinary, for the integral process of determining the carrying capacity both the qualitative as well as quantitative indicators are needed, of all displayed, tourism carrying capacity is the most comprehensive and widely established carrying capacity concept, and is therefore best suited as a starting method for setting in spatial planning framework.
   By comparing the features and procedures of spatial planning with the features and procedures of tourism carrying capacity, it was concluded that the concept of tourism carrying capacity is suitable for spatial planning, as analytical and strategic planning process leading sustainable development of the tourist area.
   It can serve as an improving spatial planning method, particularly in tourist areas, whereas: it determines the direction of planning objectives and the level of development scenarios, it imposes inherent spatial indicators, flexible and unique for each of the analyzed area, it imposes development restrictions, which are based on qualitative and quantitative standards, it introduces a process of continuous monitoring and evaluation of the feasibility of the spatial plans, and it introduces flexibility and adaptability as a feature of contemporary spatial planning process.
   In this manner, tourism carrying capacity becomes the central spatial planning tool for planning and management of tourism, especially for sensitive destinations such as historic towns, islands, natural parks, valuable landscapes, etc., destinations that should be protected and must face increasing pressures of tourism activities. These are tourist destinations that need the most protection through tourism spatial planning strategy based on an assessment of the optimum tourism carrying capacity.
   To adopt the tourism carrying capacity into a spatial planning tool for sustainable development planning the following should be set: a critical analysis of the process and framework that tourism carrying capacity introduces in spatial planning by identifying and classifying different location-specific spatial indicators and factors, the development of certain relationships and statistical models which can determine the quantitative and qualitative measurement of tourism carrying capacity, identifying and standardizing certain objectively verifiable and applicable standards and criteria of tourism site development, ways of determining the appropriate types and scenarios of future spatial development of tourism in relation to certain constraints of the local context, and models of management scenarios for spatial development of tourism in relation to the existing resource constraints in terms of resource recovery white maintaining the competitiveness of the tourist destinations.
   The concept of tourism carrying capacity in spatial planning can be used as a basis for decision-making on measures to control the growth and development of tourism in terms of intrusion into the space and its features, or as a planning scenario, which defines the maximum acceptable level of tourism spatial development. Carrying capacity can be a central concept in the process of finding and selecting appropriate, desirable, acceptable, feasible types of spatial development in accordance with the characteristics and specifics of space, measured in terms of the size of tourism activities that are projected on the spatial parameters.

AB  - Background
   Multi-strategic community wide interventions for physical activity are increasingly popular but their ability to achieve population level improvements is unknown.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effects of community wide, multi-strategic interventions upon population levels of physical activity.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Segment of the Cochrane Register of Studies, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ASSIA, the British Nursing Index, Chinese CNKI databases, EPPI Centre (DoPHER, TRoPHI), ERIC, HMIC, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus, Transport Database and Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index). We also scanned websites of the EU Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; Health-Evidence.org; the International Union for Health Promotion and Education; the NIHR Coordinating Centre for Health Technology (NCCHTA); the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NICE and SIGN guidelines. Reference lists of all relevant systematic reviews, guidelines and primary studies were searched and we contacted experts in the field. The searches were updated to 16 January 2014, unrestricted by language or publication status.
   Selection criteria
   Cluster randomised controlled trials, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs which used a control population for comparison, interrupted time-series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies were included. Only studies with a minimum six-month follow up from the start of the intervention to measurement of outcomes were included. Community wide interventions had to comprise at least two broad strategies aimed at physical activity for the whole population. Studies which randomised individuals from the same community were excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   At least two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Each study was assessed for the setting, the number of included components and their intensity. The primary outcome measures were grouped according to whether they were dichotomous (per cent physically active, per cent physically active during leisure time, and per cent physically inactive) or continuous (leisure time physical activity time (time spent)), walking (time spent), energy expenditure (as metabolic equivalents or METS)). For dichotomous measures we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. For continuous measures we calculated percentage change from baseline, unadjusted and adjusted.
   Main results
   After the selection process had been completed, 33 studies were included. A total of 267 communities were included in the review (populations between 500 and 1.9 million). Of the included studies, 25 were set in high income countries and eight were in low income countries. The interventions varied by the number of strategies included and their intensity. Almost all of the interventions included a component of building partnerships with local governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (29 studies). None of the studies provided results by socio-economic disadvantage or other markers of equity. However, of those included studies undertaken in high income countries, 14 studies were described as being provided to deprived, disadvantaged or low socio-economic communities. Nineteen studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, 10 studies were unclear, and four studies had a low risk of bias. Selection bias was a major concern with these studies, with only five studies using randomisation to allocate communities. Four studies were judged as being at low risk of selection bias although 19 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Twelve studies had a high risk of detection bias, 13 an unclear risk and four a low risk of bias. Generally, the better designed studies showed no improvement in the primary outcome measure of physical activity at a population level.
   All four of the newly included, and judged to be at low risk of bias, studies (conducted in Japan, United Kingdom and USA) used randomisation to allocate the intervention to the communities. Three studies used a cluster randomised design and one study used a stepped wedge design. The approach to measuring the primary outcome of physical activity was better in these four studies than in many of the earlier studies. One study obtained objective population representative measurements of physical activity by accelerometers, while the remaining three low-risk studies used validated self-reported measures. The study using accelerometry, conducted in low income, high crime communities of USA, emphasised social marketing, partnership with police and environmental improvements. No change in the seven-day average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity was observed during the two years of operation. Some program level effect was observed with more people walking in the intervention community, however this result was not evident in the whole community. Similarly, the two studies conducted in the United Kingdom (one in rural villages and the other in urban London; both using communication, partnership and environmental strategies) found no improvement in the mean levels of energy expenditure per person per week, measured from one to four years from baseline. None of the three low risk studies reporting a dichotomous outcome of physical activity found improvements associated with the intervention.
   Overall, there was a noticeable absence of reporting of benefit in physical activity for community wide interventions in the included studies. However, as a group, the interventions undertaken in China appeared to have the greatest possibility of success with high participation rates reported. Reporting bias was evident with two studies failing to report physical activity measured at follow up. No adverse events were reported. The data pertaining to cost and sustainability of the interventions were limited and varied.
   Authors' conclusions
   Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings in the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that the multi-component community wide interventions studied effectively increased physical activity for the population, although some studies with environmental components observed more people walking.

AB  - Background
   Nutritional interventions to prevent stunting of infants and young children are most often applied in rural areas in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Few interventions are focused on urban slums. The literature needs a systematic assessment, as infants and children living in slums are at high risk of stunting. Urban slums are complex environments in terms of biological, social, and political variables and the outcomes of nutritional interventions need to be assessed in relation to these variables. For the purposes of this review, we followed the UN-Habitat 2004 definitions for low-income informal settlements or slums as lacking one or more indicators of basic services or infrastructure.
   Objectives
   To assess the impact of nutritional interventions to reduce stunting in infants and children under five years old in urban slums from LMIC and the effect of nutritional interventions on other nutritional (wasting and underweight) and non-nutritional outcomes (socioeconomic, health and developmental) in addition to stunting.
   Search methods
   The review used a sensitive search strategy of electronic databases, bibliographies of articles, conference proceedings, websites, grey literature, and contact with experts and authors published from 1990. We searched 32 databases, in English and non-English languages (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, etc). We performed the initial literature search from November 2015 to January 2016, and conducted top up searches in March 2017 and in August 2018.
   Selection criteria
   Research designs included randomised (including cluster-randomised) trials, quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, pre- and postintervention, interrupted time series (ITS), and historically controlled studies among infants and children from LMIC, from birth to 59 months, living in urban slums. The interventions included were nutrition-specific or maternal education. The primary outcomes were length or height expressed in cm or length-for-age (LFA)/height-for-age (HFA) z-scores, and birth weight in grams or presence/absence of low birth weight (LBW).
   Data collection and analysis
   We screened and then retrieved titles and abstracts as full text if potentially eligible for inclusion. Working independently, one review author screened all titles and abstracts and extracted data on the selected population, intervention, comparison, and outcome parameters and two other authors assessed half each. We calculated mean selection difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed intervention-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, or narrative synthesis when meta-analyses were not possible. We used P less than 0.05 to assess statistical significance and intervention outcomes were also considered for their biological/health importance. Where effect sizes were small and statistically insignificant, we concluded there was 'unclear effect'.
   Main results
   The systematic review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The study locations were mainly Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. There were no dietary intervention studies. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (eight studies), nutrition education for pregnant women (two studies), and nutrition systems strengthening targeting children (two studies) intervention. Six interventions were adapted to the urban context and seven targeted household, community, or 'service delivery' via systems strengthening. The primary review outcomes were available from seven studies for LFA/HFA, four for LBW, and nine for length.
   The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only four RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Overall, the evidence was complex to report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported. Consequently, only eight study findings were reported in meta-analyses and seven in a narrative form. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate overall. None of the studies reported differential impacts of interventions relevant to equity issues.
   Zinc supplementation of pregnant women on LBW or length (versus supplementation without zinc or placebo) (three RCTs)
   There was no evidence of an effect on LBW(MD -36.13 g, 95% CI -83.61 to 11.35), with moderate-certainty evidence, or no evidence of an effect or unclear effect on length with low-to moderate-certainty evidence.
   Micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation in children (versus no intervention or placebo) (eight RCTs)
   There was no evidence of an effect or unclear effect of nutrient supplementation of children on HFA for studies in the meta-analysis with low-certainty evidence (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02), and inconclusive effect on length for studies reported in a narrative form with very low-to moderate-certainty evidence.
   Nutrition education for pregnant women (versus standard care or no intervention) (two RCTs)
   There was a positive impact on LBW of education interventions in pregnant women, with low-certainty evidence (MD 478.44g, 95% CI 423.55 to 533.32).
   Nutrition systems strengthening interventions targeting children (compared with no intervention, standard care) (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study)
   There were inconclusive results on HFA, with very low- to low-certainty evidence, and a positive influence on length at 18 months, with low-certainty evidence.
   Authors' conclusions
   All the nutritional interventions reviewed had the potential to decrease stunting, based on evidence from outside of slum contexts; however, there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in this review (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Challenges linked to urban slum programming (high mobility, lack of social services, and high loss of follow-up) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions are proposed to address LBW and stunting in such environments. More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as stunting.

TI  - The Pandemic Management Theory. COVID-19 and biocentric development
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REPORT
LA  - English
AB  - BACKGROUND
   The COVID-19 virus first appeared in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. On March 11, 2020, the WHO officially declared the outbreak a pandemic due to the rapid increase in infections outside of China. Since its discovery, many scientific papers have been carried out on medical containment and mechanisms of action, especially regarding the medical treatment of the virus infection and its symptoms as well as the organization of treatment in hospitals. There are also a number of studies on how pandemics of this magnitude affect people who are psychologically affected and burdened by the restrictive governmental measures (Bidzan et al., 2020; Schroder et al., 2020) in the short and long term. Rohr et al. (2020) provide an overview of the psychosocial consequences of quarantine measures in a systematic review, with quarantine measures being consistently associated with negative psychosocial results in 13 evaluated studies. These included the occurrence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, post-traumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness, and stigma. So far, however, there is no evidence-based and comprehensive theory to describe the psychological effect mechanisms behind the effects of coping with or processing a pandemic, as e.g. in the event of terrorist attacks (Greenberg, 2012; Tichy, 2013). In this theory, fear of death is assumed to be the central trigger for changes in self-esteem and the change in cultural values after terrorist attacks and has been proven in studies. Fears also play a central role in the COVID-19 crisis, and in the Pandemic Management Theory (PMT), but there are many more fears that occur and have an impact on the bur-den experience and on individual and collective identity and coping processes. The crisis is more complex in terms of its existential effects on social and working life and so it can be explained that the theory must also be more complex. The Pandemic Management Theory contains two circles, which are shown in Figure 1. <br
   The outer circle describes seven psychological process phases that individuals can go through in dealing with burden and loads during a pandemic. The inner circle is the centre of the Pan-demic Management Theory, in which the underlying mechanisms of action behind these seven pro-cessing phases are described based on the biocentric management approach (Stueck, 2021) and the biocentric approach of Toro (Toro, 2010) and others. These include e.g. the destabilization process of identity and the immune system through fear. Strategies for action, so-called biocentric fields of action, which contribute to overcoming this pandemic crisis and the associated destabilization processes as well as a 'biocentric', life-protecting growth after pandemic stress are also described. The Pandemic Management Theory forms the basis of an international study that was carried out at the DPFA Academy of Work and Health with 9 international universities and a total of 1500 participants and began in Germany on March 27, 2020, 6 days after the lockdown and has been continued with process surveys.
   THEORETICAL COMPONENTS OF THE EXTERNAL CIRCLE OF PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT THEORY
   The external sphere of action consists of the coping with the situations of burden during the pandemic and their assessments, which are influenced by situational and habitual factors and coping skills or psychological resources. Also, it considers the development of negative or positive effects of differ-ent subjective load interpretations, which contribute to maintaining health or illness (see Figure 2) and the criteria for the transitions between the model phases (Table 3). These components are based on:
   The Burden-Load-Model about positive and negative consequences of load interpretations (Lazarus, 1999; Rohmert & Rutenfranz, 1975; Scheuch & Schroder, 1990; Stueck, 2008),
   The Chrono-bio-psychological Burden-Model (Balzer & Stueck, 2021; Stueck et al., 2005),
   Coping models of loads, illness, disasters and stress prevention (Lazarus & Launier, 1981; Schroder, 1996; Reschke & Schroder, 2000; Stueck, 2009; Muthny, 1990; Horowitz, 2009; Khankeh et al., 2021; Witruk et al., 2009),
   Resource models (Antonovsky, 1987; Kobasa, 1990; Csikszentmihalyi & Seligman, 2000),
   Works on the model of the zone of the next development (Vygotskij, 1932/2005; Keiler, 2002).
   THE SEVEN PHASES OF THE EXTERNAL CIRCLE OF THE PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT THEORY Based on the empirical observations and the theoretical background work of the PMT, six phases of dysregulation (negative effects) and regulation (positive effects) towards illness and health during pandemic periods were defined (see Figure 2).
   Phase 1 - Orientation-phase with load interpretations of the pandemic situation ( Figure 2, field 1-4)
   In this phase the assessment of the pandemic situations by load interpretation of the situa-tion takes place. The pandemic situations in the restriction phase have constant situational character-istics, including the closed borders, social isolation through exit restrictions, closed public institu-tions, short-time work, and mask requirements. A person must deal adequately with these stimuli, in order to maintain the balance to the environmental or bodily functions (homeostasis), to achieve goals and to satisfy their needs. The subjective effects of external pandemic burdens on people are known as loads that affect people due to their interpretation or assessment of the situation. Two evaluation processes take place unconsciously and continuously:
   Situation and reaction-oriented evaluation (Figure 2, field 2): It is assessed whether the situation is a burden, threatening, under-/overwhelming or frustrating; or the situation is experienced as a challenge or arousing curiosity.
   Assessment of coping resources (Figure 2, field 3): The second assessment answers the ques-tion of whether the individual has enough capacities to cope with the situation.
   The relationship between burden situations in the lockdown or other pandemic situations and load interpretations begins with the perception or triggering of physiological arousal (including cardiovascular parameters or muscle tension (Balzer & Stueck, 2021). This physiological feedback then influences the assessment processes. The assessment processes are also influenced by situational and habitual factors (Figure 2, field 4). Habitual characteristics are personality aspects or behaviour that are inherent to behaviour, have become habitual or are integral to the character (Table 1).
   At the beginning of a pandemic, in the orientation phase, positive and negative load reactions arise.
   Phase 2 - Phase of the pandemic load reactions ( Figure 1, field 5)
   It is a phase of short-term adaptability with the following load reactions depending on the assessment of 96 subjects in the first 14 days after the lockdown (without load consequences, Table 2).
   The load reactions are processed with routine active or inner-psychological coping strategies. This includes the following coping processes:
   In the cognitive domain, assimilation and accommodation, i.e. classification of the experienc-es in existing or newly created explanatory patterns, but also the initiation of cognition-controlled actions.
   In the emotional area the transformative observation of emotional states takes place (emo-tionbased regulation). After the attempt at coping a reassessment of the person-environment situation is undertaken (primary, secondary). The orientation phase does not trigger an emer-gency signal.
   Phase 3 - Phase of acute, negative consequences of subjective load interpretations ( Figure 2, field 6)
   If the load reactions in pandemic situations cannot be coped with, acute misuse with nega-tive consequences of load and burden occurs. This phase consists of 2 sub-phases: children, especially a healthy relationship with oneself, with others and in dealing with na-ture, is of decisive importance for the continued existence of humanity and the protection of our planet. Adults can only take children as far as they have already gotten themselves.

AB  - BackgroundMost maternal deaths occur during the intrapartum and peripartum periods in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing the importance of timely access to quality health service for childbirth and postpartum care. Increasing facility births and provision of postpartum care has been the focus of numerous interventions globally, including in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this scoping review is to synthetize the characteristics and effectiveness of interventions to increase facility births or provision of postpartum care in sub-Saharan Africa.MethodsWe searched for systematic reviews, scoping reviews, qualitative studies and quantitative studies using experimental, quasi experimental, or observational designs, which reported on interventions for increasing facility birth or provision of postpartum care in sub-Saharan Africa. These studies were published in English or French. The search comprised six scientific literature databases (Pubmed, CAIRN, la Banque de Donnees en Sante Publique, the Cochrane Library). We also used Google Scholar and snowball or citation tracking.ResultsStrategies identified in the literature as increasing facility births in the sub-Saharan African context include community awareness raising, health expenses reduction (transportation or user fee), non-monetary incentive programs (baby kits), or a combination of these with improvement of care quality (patient's privacy, waiting time, training of provider), and or follow-up of pregnant women to use health facility for birth. Strategies that were found to increase provision of postpartum care include improvement of care quality, community-level identification and referrals of postpartum problems and transport voucher program.ConclusionsTo accelerate achievements in facility birth and provision of postpartum care in sub-Saharan Africa, we recommend strategies that can be implemented sustainably or produce sustainable change. How to sustainably motivate community actors in health interventions may be particularly important in this respect. Furthermore, we recommend that more intervention studies are implemented in West and Central Africa, and focused more on postpartum.Plain English summaryIn in sub-Saharan Africa, many women die when giving or few days after birth. This happens because they do not have access to good health services in a timely manner during labor and after giving birth. Worldwide, many interventions have been implemented to Increase the number of women giving birth in a health facility or receiving care from health professional after giving birth. The objective of this study is to synthetize the characteristics and effectiveness of interventions that have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, aiming to increase the number of women giving birth in a health facility or receiving care from health professional after birth. To proceed with this synthesis, we did a review of studies that have reported on such interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. These studies were published in English or French. The interventions identified to increase the number of women giving birth in a health facility include community awareness raising, reduction of health expenses (transportation or user fee), non-monetary incentive programs (baby kits), or a combination of these with improvement of care quality (patient's privacy, waiting time, training of provider), and or follow-up of pregnant women to use health facility for birth.
   Interventions implemented to increase the number women receiving care from a health professional after birth include improvement of care quality, transport voucher program and community-level identification and referrals to the health center of mothers' health problems. In sub-Saharan Africa, to accelerate increase in the number of women giving birth in a health facility and receiving care from a health professional after, we recommend interventions that can be implemented sustainably or produce sustainable change. How to sustainably motivate community actors in health interventions may be particularly important in this respect. Furthermore, we recommend the conduct in West and Central Africa, of more studies targeting interventions to increase the number of women giving birth in a health facility and or receiving care from a health professional after birth.

La recherche a porte sur six bases de donnees de litterature scientifique (Pubmed, CAIRN, la Banque de Donnees en Sante Publique, la Cochrane Library). Nous avons egalement utilise Google Scholar et le suivi des boules de neige ou des citations.ResultatsLes strategies identifiees dans la litterature comme accroissant les accouchements intentionnels dans le contexte de l'Afrique subsaharienne comprennent la sensibilisation des communautes, la reduction des depenses de sante (transport ou frais d'utilisation), des programmes d'incitation non monetaires (kits pour bebes), ou une combinaison de ces elements avec l'amelioration de la qualite des soins (respect de la vie privee du patient, temps d'attente, formation du prestataire), et ou le suivi des femmes enceintes pour qu'elles utilisent l'etablissement de sante pour l'accouchement. Les strategies qui ont ete trouvees pour accroitre l'offre des soins post-partum comprennent l'amelioration de la qualite des soins, l'identification au niveau communautaire et la reference des problemes post-partum et le programme de bons de transport.ConclusionsPour accelerer les realisations en matiere d'accouchement institutionnel et d'offre de soins post-partum en Afrique subsaharienne, nous recommandons des strategies qui peuvent etre mises en oe uvre de maniere durable ou produire des changements durables. La maniere de motiver durablement les acteurs communautaires dans les interventions sanitaires peut etre particulierement importante a cet egard.
   En outre, nous recommandons que davantage d'etudes d'intervention soient mises en oe uvre en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre, et qu'elles soient davantage axees sur les soins post-partum.

AB  - The medical profession should play a central role in evaluating the evidence related to drugs, devices, and procedures for the detection, management, and prevention of disease. When properly applied, expert analysis of available data on the benefits and risks of these therapies and procedures can improve the quality of care, optimize patient outcomes, and favorably affect costs by focusing resources on the most effective strategies. An organized and directed approach to a thorough review of evidence has resulted in the production of clinical practice guidelines that assist physicians in selecting the best management strategy for an individual patient. Moreover, clinical practice guidelines can provide a foundation for other applications, such as performance measures, appropriate use criteria, and both quality improvement and clinical decision support tools.
   The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have jointly produced guidelines in the area of cardiovascular disease since 1980. The ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force), charged with developing, updating, and revising practice guidelines for cardiovascular diseases and procedures, directs and oversees this effort. Writing committees are charged with regularly reviewing and evaluating all available evidence to develop balanced, patient-centric recommendations for clinical practice.
   Experts in the subject under consideration are selected by the ACCF and AHA to examine subject-specific data and write guidelines in partnership with representatives from other medical organizations and specialty groups. Writing committees are asked to perform a formal literature review; weigh the strength of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and include estimates of expected outcomes where such data exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities, and issues of patient preference that may influence the choice of tests or therapies are considered. When available, information from studies on cost is considered, but data on efficacy and outcomes constitute the primary basis for the recommendations contained herein.
   In analyzing the data and developing recommendations and supporting text, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies developed by the Task Force (1). The Class of Recommendation (COR) is an estimate of the size of the treatment effect considering risks versus benefits in addition to evidence and/or agreement that a given treatment or procedure is or is not useful/effective or in some situations may cause harm. The Level of Evidence (LOE) is an estimate of the certainty or precision of the treatment effect. The writing committee reviews and ranks evidence supporting each recommendation with the weight of evidence ranked as LOE A, B, or C according to specific definitions that are included in Table 1. Studies are identified as observational, retrospective, prospective, or randomized where appropriate. For certain conditions for which inadequate data are available, recommendations are based on expert consensus and clinical experience and are ranked as LOE C. When recommendations at LOE C are supported by historical clinical data, appropriate references (including clinical reviews) are cited if available. For issues for which sparse data are available, a survey of current
   [GRAPHICS]
   practice among the clinicians on the writing committee is the basis for LOE C recommendations, and no references are cited. The schema for COR and LOE is summarized in Table 1, which also provides suggested phrases for writing recommendations within each COR. A new addition to this methodology is separation of the Class III recommendations to delineate if the recommendation is determined to be of "no benefit" or is associated with "harm" to the patient. In addition, in view of the increasing number of comparative effectiveness studies, comparator verbs and suggested phrases for writing recommendations for the comparative effectiveness of one treatment or strategy versus another have been added for COR I and IIa, LOE A or B only.
   In view of the advances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, the Task Force has designated the term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to represent optimal medical therapy as defined by ACCF/AHA guideline-recommended therapies (primarily Class I). This new term, GDMT, will be used herein and throughout all future guidelines.
   Because the ACCF/AHA practice guidelines address patient populations (and healthcare providers) residing in North America, drugs that are not currently available in North America are discussed in the text without a specific COR. For studies performed in large numbers of subjects outside North America, each writing committee reviews the potential influence of different practice patterns and patient populations on the treatment effect and relevance to the ACCF/AHA target population to determine whether the findings should inform a specific recommendation.
   The ACCF/AHA practice guidelines are intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of specific diseases or conditions. The guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of all the circumstances presented by that patient. As a result, situations may arise for which deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate. Clinical decision making should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise in the area where care is provided. When these guidelines are used as the basis for regulatory or payer decisions, the goal should be improvement in quality of care. The Task Force recognizes that situations arise in which additional data are needed to inform patient care more effectively; these areas will be identified within each respective guideline when appropriate.
   Prescribed courses of treatment in accordance with these recommendations are effective only if followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affect outcomes, physicians and other healthcare providers should make every effort to engage the patient's active participation in prescribed medical regimens and lifestyles. In addition, patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a particular treatment and be involved in shared decision making whenever feasible, particularly for COR IIa and IIb, where the benefit-to-risk ratio may be lower.
   The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of industry relationships or personal interests among the members of the writing committee. All writing committee members and peer reviewers of the guideline are required to disclose all such current relationships, as well as those existing 12 months previously. In December 2009, the ACCF and AHA implemented a new policy for relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) that requires the writing committee chair plus a minimum of 50% of the writing committee to have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1 for the ACCF/AHA definition of relevance). These statements are reviewed by the Task Force and all members during each conference call and meeting of the writing committee and are updated as changes occur. All guideline recommendations require a confidential vote by the writing committee and must be approved by a consensus of the voting members. Members are not permitted to write, and must recuse themselves from voting on, any recommendation or section to which their RWI apply. Members who recused themselves from voting are indicated in the list of writing committee members, and section recusals are noted in Appendix 1. Authors' and peer reviewers' RWI pertinent to this guideline are disclosed in Appendixes 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, to ensure complete transparency, writing committee members' comprehensive disclosure information-including RWI not pertinent to this document-is available as an online supplement. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online at www.cardiosource.org/ACC/About-ACC/Leadership/Guidelinesand-Documents-Task-Forces.aspx. The work of the writing committee was supported exclusively by the ACCF and AHA without commercial support. Writing committee members volunteered their time for this activity.
   In an effort to maintain relevance at the point of care for practicing physicians, the Task Force continues to oversee an ongoing process improvement initiative. As a result, in response to pilot projects, evidence tables (with references linked to abstracts in PubMed) have been added.
   In April 2011, the Institute of Medicine released 2 reports: Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2,3). It is noteworthy that the ACCF/AHA guidelines are cited as being compliant with many of the proposed standards. A thorough review of these reports and of our current methodology is under way, with further enhancements anticipated.
   The recommendations in this guideline are considered current until they are superseded by a focused update or the full-text guideline is revised. Guidelines are official policy of both the ACCF and AHA.

The writing committee reviews and ranks evidence supporting each recommendation with the weight of evidence ranked as LOE A, B, or C according to specific definitions that are included in Table 1. Studies are identified as observational, retrospective, prospective, or randomized where appropriate. For certain conditions for which inadequate data are available, recommendations are based on expert consensus and clinical experience and are ranked as LOE C. When recommendations at LOE C are supported by historical clinical data, appropriate references (including clinical reviews) are cited if available. For issues for which sparse data are available, a survey of current practice among the clinicians on the writing committee is the basis for LOE C recommendations, and no references are cited. The schema for COR and LOE is summarized in Table 1, which also provides suggested phrases for writing recommendations within each COR. A new addition to this methodology is separation of the Class III recommendations to delineate if the recommendation is determined to be of "no benefit" or is associated with "harm" to the patient. In addition, in view of the increasing number of comparative effectiveness studies, comparator verbs and suggested phrases for writing recommendations for the comparative effectiveness of one treatment or strategy versus another have been added for COR I and IIa, LOE A or B only.
   In view of the advances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, the Task Force has designated the term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to represent optimal medical therapy as defined by ACCF/AHA guideline-recommended therapies (primarily Class I). This new term, GDMT, will be used herein and throughout all future guidelines.
   Because the ACCF/AHA practice guidelines address patient populations (and healthcare providers) residing in North America, drugs that are not currently available in North America are discussed in the text without a specific COR. For studies performed in large numbers of subjects outside North America, each writing committee reviews the potential influence of different practice patterns and patient populations on the treatment effect and relevance to the ACCF/AHA target population to determine whether the findings should inform a specific recommendation.
   The ACCF/AHA practice guidelines are intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of specific diseases or conditions. The guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of all the circumstances presented by that patient. As a result, situations may arise for which deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate. Clinical decision making should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise in the area where care is provided. When these guidelines are used as the basis for regulatory or payer decisions, the goal should be improvement in quality of care. The Task Force recognizes that situations arise in which additional data are needed to inform patient care more effectively; these areas will be identified within each respective guideline when appropriate.
   Prescribed courses of treatment in accordance with these recommendations are effective only if followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affect outcomes, physicians and other healthcare providers should make every effort to engage the patient's active participation in prescribed medical regimens and lifestyles. In addition, patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a particular treatment and be involved in shared decision making whenever feasible, particularly for COR IIa and IIb, where the benefit-to-risk ratio may be lower.
   The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of industry relationships or personal interests among the members of the writing committee. All writing committee members and peer reviewers of the guideline are required to disclose all such current relationships, as well as those existing 12 months previously. In December 2009, the ACCF and AHA implemented a new policy for relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) that requires the writing committee chair plus a minimum of 50% of the writing committee to have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1 for the ACCF/AHA definition of relevance). These statements are reviewed by the Task Force and all members during each conference call and meeting of the writing committee and are updated as changes occur. All guideline recommendations require a confidential vote by the writing committee
   [GRAPHICS]
   and must be approved by a consensus of the voting members. Members are not permitted to write, and must rescue themselves from voting on, any recommendation or section to which their RWI apply. Members who recused themselves from voting are indicated in the list of writing committee members, and section recusals are noted in Appendix 1. Authors' and peer reviewers' RWI pertinent to this guideline are disclosed in Appendixes 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, to ensure complete transparency, writing committee members' comprehensive disclosure information-including RWI not pertinent to this document-is available as an online supplement. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online at www. cardiosource. org/ACC/About-ACC/Leadership/Guidelines-and-Documents-Task-Forces.aspx. The work of the writing committee was supported exclusively by the ACCF and AHA without commercial support. Writing committee members volunteered their time for this activity.
   In an effort to maintain relevance at the point of care for practicing physicians, the Task Force continues to oversee an ongoing process improvement initiative. As a result, in response to pilot projects, evidence tables (with references linked to abstracts in PubMed) have been added.
   In April 2011, the Institute of Medicine released 2 reports: Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2,3). It is noteworthy that the ACCF/AHA guidelines are cited as being compliant with many of the proposed standards. A thorough review of these reports and of our current methodology is under way, with further enhancements anticipated.
   The recommendations in this guideline are considered current until they are superseded by a focused update or the full-text guideline is revised. Guidelines are official policy of both the ACCF and AHA.

AB  - The medical profession should play a central role in evaluating the evidence related to drugs, devices, and procedures for the detection, management, and prevention of disease. When properly applied, expert analysis of available data on the benefits and risks of these therapies and procedures can improve the quality of care, optimize patient outcomes, and favorably affect costs by focusing resources on the most effective strategies. An organized and directed approach to a thorough review of evidence has resulted in the production of clinical practice guidelines that assist physicians in selecting the best management strategy for an individual patient. Moreover, clinical practice guidelines can provide a foundation for other applications, such as performance measures, appropriate use criteria, and both quality improvement and clinical decision support tools.
   The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have jointly produced guidelines in the area of cardiovascular disease since 1980. The ACCF/AHATask Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force), charged with developing, updating, and revising practice guidelines for cardiovascular diseases and procedures, directs and oversees this effort. Writing committees are charged with regularly reviewing and evaluating all available evidence to develop balanced, patient-centric recommendations for clinical practice.
   Experts in the subject under consideration are selected by the ACCF and AHA to examine subject-specific data and write guidelines in partnership with representatives from other medical organizations and specialty groups. Writing committees are asked to perform a formal literature review; weigh the strength of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and include estimates of expected outcomes where such data exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities, and issues of patient preference that may influence the choice of tests or therapies are considered. When available, information from studies on cost is considered, but data on efficacy and outcomes constitute the primary basis for the recommendations contained herein.
   In analyzing the data and developing recommendations and supporting text, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies developed by the Task Force. 1 The Class of Recommendation (COR) is an estimate of the size of the treatment effect considering risks versus benefits in addition to evidence and/or agreement that a given treatment or procedure is or is not useful/effective or in some situations may cause harm. The Level of Evidence (LOE) is an estimate of the certainty or precision of the treatment effect. The writing committee reviews and ranks evidence supporting each recommendation with the weight of evidence ranked as LOE A, B, or C according to specific definitions that are included in Table 1.

AB  - Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide range of health services, including prevention and public health promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained. According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too. Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
   Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication? Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland, randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist, filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n = 59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19% of the patients in the control group and for 68% in the intervention group. Shortly after the appointment, only 14% of the patients in the control group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32% in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64% in the control group vs 95% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new antihypertensive medications.
   Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation. Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP) trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018, trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44 of them 65.7% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5%) refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their achievements. 'Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion: Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
   Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3%) were classified as having peripartum depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs. Incidences of depression were 17.4% in women with a history of antidepressant medication, 16% among women with diabetes, and 11.8% among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without. Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy may help identify women in need of support.
   Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions. This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102 were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The participants' age had a significant influence on sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438 participants, 33.3% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7% general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education. 'Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction: 49.8% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently. Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
   Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies, reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial. According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests the term 'effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE. Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3, 2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword 'Hawthorne Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting. Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its implication as an experimental artefact.
   Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise. Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming. Recent eHealth tools, such as the 'systematic tool to reduce inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10 patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients' willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss primary care in this new eHealth environment.
   Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide. Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions. How often it happened towards young doctors working as general practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9%, female 87%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of the residents were working in an urban practice (63%), others in the rural and the suburban once (27%, 10%). All GP residents experienced patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them. High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was experienced by 44%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual harassment) by 84% while all residents experienced verbal violence. Only 13.2% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions. Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
   Background: About 50% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France. Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development, validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and 18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65 years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence: motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE protocol.
   Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe how these associations differ across different European countries and regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+ years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis will take into account differences between countries and regions. Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits, social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants (49.09%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95%CI: -1.29, -1.24) with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in Israel, -0.67 (95%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
   Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking, hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy. Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004 with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7%) were diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the age of 45 onwards was 94.0% (95%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8% (95%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was associated with a 9.0-year delay (95%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants without risk factors was 6.0 years (95%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent 21.6% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8% for those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45 years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up. Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of morbidity of NCDs.
   Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how: financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of recording diagnoses was about 40% in the primary care units. After four years, the recording rate had risen to 90% (p < 0.001). The rate of change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
   Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and communities and remains undiscovered in 90% of the cases. In total, 80% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the Netherlands, at least 3% (118 000) of children are victims of child abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3% of abuse cases are reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs' experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results: Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling that 'something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients' trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other professionals.
   Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts, especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results: There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
   Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care. Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity. Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e. decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up? Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status 'decompensation' or 'nothing to report' was collected. A logistic regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6% of the population, had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days. Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039). Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others in medical literature.
   Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the 20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods: Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure using electronic medical records based on the International Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness diversity.
   Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations. Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods: Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the 'homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training, and for further research in these five countries.
   Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively. Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2. Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement scores.
   Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research, which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now. There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that 'intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different challenges to researchers and health services compared to 'active psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward. This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also the scale.
   Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR) database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records. Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented, stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the context of multimorbidity.
   Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48% female. Thirty-one percent lived alone, and 85% prepared their medication themselves, all others required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular medicines and 24% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76%) were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78% did not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96%), long-term drugs (56%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92%). When it comes to deprescribing, 89% of participants wanted as much information as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP was a further key factor to them (85%). Conclusion: Most older adults are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared decision-making with the GP they trust.
   Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity, general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need' patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to automatically create a list of possible 'high need' patients could be a quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients. Research question: Can 'high need' patients with multimorbidity be identified automatically from their primary care medical records? Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were identified, of which 48% were above the age of 65 and 57% female. More than 42% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62% used five or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC: 0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: 'High need' patients with multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
   Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies. Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up? Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted, estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2) the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP. Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total, 916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific (42.0% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases (19.3%), osteometabolic (7.9%), cardio-circulatory (6.6%), and others. Most patients, minimum 59.2%, remained in the same cluster during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1%) and nervous (31.8%) MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
   Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the general population. Research question: What is the best possible reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36, SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to 0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as no external validity is available.
   Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question: This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test. We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer, receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment, anaemia less than 9 mg%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637 patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September 2017. The following information was collected: age, gender, socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA, CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of infection between 29 and 60%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c increased the risk by 8.5%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the infection increases the chance of infection by 734%. Conclusion: Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much more significant risk factor.

AB  - Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.

AB  - When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world.
   In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.
